At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DISH Network Corporation Q4 and Year-end 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jason Kiser, you may begin your conference.","Jason Kiser","Thanks, Candace. Well, thanks for joining us, everybody. My name is Jason Kiser. I'm the Treasurer here at DISH Network, joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman; Joe Clayton, our CEO; Tom Cullen, EVP of Corporate Development; Bernie Han, who's dialing in to the call as our COO. We've got Dave Shull, our Chief Commercial Officer; Robert Olson, our CFO; Paul Orban, our Controller; and Stanton Dodge, our General Counsel. So we've got the full house here today.","Before we open it up for some Q&A, we do need to do our Safe Harbor disclosure. So for that, we will turn it over to Stanton.","R. Stanton Dodge","Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in their reports. We also do not allow audio taping and ask that you respect that.","All statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements, which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from historical results and [ph] future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a list of those factors, please refer to the front of our 10-K. All cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as being applicable to the forward-looking statements we make wherever they appear. You should consider carefully the risks described in our reports and should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which we assume no responsibility of updating.","And with that out of the way, I'll turn it over to Joe.","Joseph P. Clayton","Thanks, Stanton, and good afternoon to those of you on the East Coast, and good morning to our West Coast participants.","Now today, I'll discuss our most recent transaction and I'll also review some of the key highlights from the 2014 CES show, where DISH was once again front and center in terms of the press, the public, our distribution and programming partners. And finally, I'll cover our commercial and operational performance for the fourth quarter. Charlie and Tom Cullen are also here with us to take your questions on our spectrum status a little later.","Now I want to start today with the EchoStar transaction that we recently completed and was mentioned in our 10-K. Since the DISH-EchoStar spin-off in 2008, DISH has expanded its direct-to-consumer business. To further enhance that core competency, DISH has agreed to transfer to EchoStar and to lease back capacity on 5 of its own satellites. Now in exchange, DISH will receive a preferred tracking stock that represents an 80% economic interest in the Hughes Net retail consumer satellite broadband business. As of year end, Hughes Net had approximately 600,000 retail subscribers.","Now this move significantly increases our interest in the expanding satellite broadband market, and it is also a natural extension of the investment that we've already made in our own dishNET business. Stated very simply, we've agreed to transfer and to lease back capacity on 5 satellites that were already being operated for us by EchoStar. Now in exchange, we received a major stake in an established business in the growing satellite broadband market. Now later, Robert will briefly describe the P&L impact of this transaction.","Moving on. At the CES show last month, we continued to expand our technology superiority to better serve the needs of the American consumer. We're forcing all the other pay-TV providers to play catch-up, and at DISH, we just keep setting the bar higher. It's part of our never-ending goal to provide our customers with simply the best video experience, period.","As usual, our new product introductions received numerous awards. First, the new Super Joey, when paired with our consumer-friendly Hopper, now provides the consumer the ability to record up to 8 programs, that's right, up to 8 programs at one time. This basically eliminates channel conflict. The Super Joey received the prestigious CES 2014 Editors' Choice award from Reviewed.com, a division of USA Today.","Again this year, with a little less controversy, the Best of CES award in the video category went to our Virtual Joey product. Now this provides the customer the ability to directly connect with the Hopper to access live and recorded TV in other rooms of the home using a Sony PlayStation 3 or 4 or a LG Electronics Smart TV. No extra Joey is required, so there is less set-top box clutter in the home.","And finally, our new Wireless Joey eliminates the need to hook up your Joey to a coax cable connection. So now the Hopper with Sling service can be expanded into the hard-to-get-to places in the home: the garage, patio, bathroom, kitchen. DISH is indeed available anywhere. This revolutionary product helps resolve the cable clutter found in American homes today. And it gives consumers a choice of where they can watch TV.","In addition to these significant product introductions, we also enhanced our consumer usability by adding new content discovery and search features such as voice activation, recommendation capability and faster processing speeds. Lastly, we announced the expansion of our Southwest Airlines partnership and the continuing association with Apple. We will continue to provide qualifying customers a free iPad when they purchase our Hopper with Sling product and an appropriate programming package. And finally, we implemented our price increase on January 17, which became effective with February 2 bills.","Now on to the fourth quarter performance. We faced fierce pricing pressures, aggressive promotions, a weak economy, local retransmission channel takedowns and new video providers in the fourth quarter. In fact, the competitive environment may have been the toughest quarter of the year, as all the pay-TV providers scrambled to attain their year-end goals. Despite the headwinds, we gained approximately 60,000 customers. This includes 8,000 new subscribers in our pay-TV business, which is roughly on par with last year's fourth quarter. This takes our pay-TV customer base to 14,057,000. Our broadband satellite business continued to expand, as we added over 50,000 new dishNET subscribers, and this improves our customer count to 436,000 at year end. In total, we continue to grow our base of high-value customers and to increase the percentage of customers with HD, DVR and IP connections. We were also pleased that our churn results came in at 1.53% for the quarter.","Now to provide you all with additional details on our financial performance, here's our CFO, Robert Olson.","Robert E. Olson","Thank you. As Joe noted, we had solid subscriber results in the fourth quarter. Pay-TV activations and churn tracked closely with last year, while broadband activations increased significantly year-over-year in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2013, DISH pay-TV subscribers were flat, which was consistent with the overall industry. However, our broadband business grew by more than 250,000 subscribers. We expect the broadband business to continue to grow in 2014.","Our full year financial results and the prior year results include our Blockbuster operations recast for discontinued operations. As of December 31, Blockbuster had ceased all material operations.","Total revenue grew by 5.5% in 2013 compared to 2012, and increased by 6.6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This growth was due to a combination of increased pay-TV ARPU and increased broadband revenue. pay-TV ARPU was up 4.9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter but fairly flat to the third quarter. As discussed in our last earnings call, we benefited from strong pay-per-view revenue in the third quarter. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, this headwind was offset by normal seasonal improvements in advertising revenue. Broadband revenue was up $43 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","Subscriber-related expenses increased by 7.8% in 2013 versus 2012, and was up by roughly the same percentage year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This increase was largely driven by higher programming expenses. The programming expense increase was due to contractual rate increases and was consistent with the trends we have seen during the last few years. In addition, our growing broadband business accounted for slightly over 1 percentage point of the year-over-year increases for both fourth quarter and full year.","pay-TV SAC for 2013 was 866 per activation -- $866 per activation, an increase of 10.5% versus 2012. The increase was largely due to capital expenses and advertising expenses associated with our Hopper receiver systems. pay-TV SAC was up slightly in fourth quarter compared to third quarter due to increased advertising spending per activation.","Administrative expenses in 2013 were up 7.6% year-over-year, driven largely by M&A activity in our wireless segment and growth in our broadband subscriber base. Depreciation and amortization expenses were up 9.3% year-over-year in 2013, primarily due to the growing base of Hopper receiver systems.","Our overall operating income in both years was impacted by onetime items, including the Voom settlement in 2012 and the impairment of the T2 and D1 satellites in 2013. Other income improved by $52 million in 2013 compared to 2012, as increased interest expense associated with higher debt levels was more than offset by gains on equity and debt sales plus realized and unrealized gains on derivative financial instruments. We recognized $166 million of these -- net gains in fourth quarter, largely driven by the sale of Clearwire debt and by the appreciation of our derivative financial instruments.","Net income attributable to DISH Network was up 26.8% for the full year. This same metric was up 37.7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Both periods were impacted by onetime items. Our adjusted free cash flow for the full year 2013 was slightly over $1 billion.","Finally, as Joe described, we reached an agreement with EchoStar this week for a transaction in which we will transfer 5 of our own satellites, plus $11 million in cash, in exchange for 2 series of preferred tracking stocks that represent an 80% economic interest in the Hughes Retail broadband business. As part of this transaction, we will lease back certain capacity on these 5 satellites. Joe described the strategic rationale, and I will briefly describe the financial impacts.","Since these agreements are among entities under common control, we will record the tracking stocks at their historical cost basis. Any difference between the cost basis and the net carrying value of the 5 satellites will be recorded as a capital transaction in additional paid-in capital on our balance sheet. Our economic share in Hughes retail broadband business going forward will be accounted for on a cost basis, which means that unless we receive dividends or impair these assets, this tracking stock will have no short-term effect on DISH's income statement.","On the other hand, the change in ownership for the 5 satellites will drive changes in satellite lease expense and depreciation starting March 1. In 2014, we anticipate roughly $148 million of incremental satellite lease expenses, partially offset by approximately $40 million less depreciation expense. The monthly run rate for lease expenses will gradually decline during the next several years as specific satellites reach the end of their lease terms.","Let me now turn it back to Joe before we start Q&A.","Joseph P. Clayton","Thanks, Robert. In summary, we continue to grow our high-value customers and to increase revenue while making the strategic investments for our future. Thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. Now we'll open it up to your questions. And we'll start with questions from the financial analysts. When we're finished with those, we'll open up the line for questions from the media.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess just coming back to the transaction with SATS. I'm curious what is in place around change of control. If, in fact, SATS were to be acquired, how does the tracking equity get dealt with one way or the other? And what kind of valuation approach is taken? And Robert, just to clarify. So you said there's no impact on the income statement. You're talking about from the equity pickup on the investment. Obviously, it's going to hit earnings a touch with the satellite lease expense and the depreciation, right?","Robert E. Olson","Ben, that's right. The satellites lease expense that I mentioned, the depreciation will hit the income statement. But from the tracking stock alone, unless there's an impairment or a dividend, it won't hit the income statement.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and anything on the change of control side?","Robert E. Olson","Once again, there are change of control provisions. We usually don't disclose that, but there are change of control provisions in the agreement between us and EchoStar.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then, just as we think about trying to value this on a go-forward basis, is there a meaningful difference in sort of the contribution margin in a customer at dishNET and then the new -- or I guess, go-forward Hughes retail business? Are they similar in terms of the economic cash flow that each sub generates?","Robert E. Olson","Ben, this is Robert again. That's correct. They are similar in their economic model. So as you value that, you can look at our dishNET business and assess that.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. And the last one, just for the team, obviously, a major transaction in the industry with Comcast, Time Warner Cable. What's the sort of DISH perspective on that transaction? Where are you focused in terms of maybe program access or net neutrality? Do you think there is something that the government needs to do here with this deal to address some competitive concerns you have?","Thomas A. Cullen","Ben, this is Tom. Naturally, when our largest competitor expects to expand its homes-passed footprint by over 55%, it's extremely concerning. That being said, it's only been a week since the announcement, so management is still assessing the proposed merger's potential impact and our options. And we'll be discussing the implications of that with our board in the near future.","Operator","And your next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. On the SATS deal, so we can understand the economics better, I mean, I can understand why SATS would want to do this, they'd get income stream immediately from DISH. I'm not quite sure I understand the benefit to DISH just owning a portion of the Hughes satellite business. I mean, is there a value on this deal on the stock, $0.5 billion or so, something that would make sense of the leaseback? And why didn't you send EchoStar 15 and assign 18 to SATS as well, as part of this?","Thomas A. Cullen","Doug, it's Tom. We look at the satellite broadband business as a long-term opportunity. The equity position that we've taken in their retail group, it's aligned with our -- the value that DISH has created over time is based on subscription-based consumer economics. And we believe in that business and we think there's long-term benefit there. As far as the transfer of the specific satellites, I think on the one -- the other one that you referenced, there's still tax benefit for DISH to gain from continuing to hold the latter satellites that you referenced.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I guess, the part of trying to understand the deal better and the rationale behind deal is really this is still going to be a business that resides within SATS and Hughes, something that DISH doesn't really have any legal or operating control over other than a common chairman, correct?","Joseph P. Clayton","Yes, the wholesale business and the retail business both continue to be controlled -- the Hughes retail business continue to be controlled by EchoStar. DISH simply has an economic interest in that retail consumer base and the economics associated with it.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Did you extend or what's the length of the wholesale agreement between DISH and SATS around selling broadband?","Robert E. Olson","Doug, this is Robert. We did extend that agreement for 10 years past the date of the agreement, so to March 2014 -- March 2024, rather.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then, if I could, one more for Tom or Charlie. Just an update on strategy around uplink spectrum, in particular, what happens if DISH doesn't end up with LightSquared? And is there any sort of, Tom, from your angle, update on standards approval process or vendor negotiations? That will be helpful.","Thomas A. Cullen","Yes, Doug, I'll comment. As for LightSquared, the bid for a portion of LightSquared assets, which was proposed by a subsidiary of DISH, that bid included specific milestone dates. As the bankruptcy process was extended beyond the final date in that proposal, the bid expired on its own terms and we decided not to pursue it any further. As I hope you can understand, I can't comment beyond that due to ongoing litigation. As for uplink spectrum, as you know, AWS-3 includes some uplink spectrum, as well as some paired spectrum. Those are frequency bands that are of interest to us. But we'll wait to see how the FCC rules come out to see if the rules are favorable for us. But clearly, it's an auction that is planned for later this year, and we're going to be watching it closely.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Tom, anything in terms of timing on standards approvals? It's a process that's underway. Can you just remind us how much longer before we could expect sort of a new set of standards for the spectrum you own?","Thomas A. Cullen","Well, we have approval on the band for AWS-4. As you know, the -- in a current uplink, downlink configuration. As you know, based on the agreement we reached with the FCC in September, we now have flexibility for a period of time to convert the uplink to downlink. That would require another phase with 3GPP. However, Doug, we're going to -- we're really waiting to see what the totality of our spectrum position is which, again, may be influenced by upcoming auctions, and including the H-block auction which is ongoing right now. Once we have a firmer grasp of the totality of our spectrum position, we think that's the best time to go in and finalize standards, bands, as well as, as you mentioned, antenna design and negotiations with vendors.","Operator","And your next question comes from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Tom, when you're talking about the totality of the spectrum, is that something that you anticipate would occur after AWS-3 auction or could that timeline extend beyond that? Obviously, you have a lot of time to decide what you're going to do on the downlink.","Thomas A. Cullen","Yes, it's a little premature to forecast that, Walt. But clearly, the 2 auctions that are being conducted this year will influence our thinking on that.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the rights that EchoStar got on the, I guess it's the T2 satellite, seems to give them some synergies with the Solaris acquisition, and obviously, anything -- any other asset opportunities in Europe. Those seem to be more spectrum plays. Why would it make sense to let T2 go, and why was Solaris done at SATS as opposed to explore maybe some global spectrum opportunities within the DISH umbrella?","Thomas A. Cullen","A couple comments. One, most of that is a SATS question, but when we spun SATS in 2008 from DISH, international opportunities were earmarked as primarily a SATS initiative, first of all. Secondly, they made the investment in Solaris and they're doing what they can to clarify that position with each of the member states in the E.U. As for the sale of the T2 satellite, it's not -- it wasn't a satellite that we had use for, and there's not a large market for those types of satellites. And so when they expressed interest, we evaluated it and think we were fairly compensated for it.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question, to the extent that -- it's obviously out, it's not even speculated anymore, I think Tom Wheeler yesterday said that Sprint and T-Mobile came to him talking about a potential transaction. So to the extent that those companies are considering a transaction, would you ever envision that it would be in the best interest of the company to be -- ever just be -- end up being a wholesaler of someone else's network? Or do you think that owning the network is important to running your business?","Thomas A. Cullen","I'll let Charlie expand if he wants to. But I think as we've said in the past, we haven't ruled out anything, and we enjoy the position that we're in now of having optionality. And we can't really comment on how the rest of the industry landscape is going to change in the interim.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, this Charlie. I think -- you guys have known us a long time. I think we look at each investment from an economic point of view for our shareholders, right? And from a spectrum position, we've committed to the H-block auction, about $1.5 billion. We will -- we should end up, in theory, with about a little over a $5 billion investment in spectrum and have about 50 megahertz of potentially downlink spectrum, right? And the world has changed in a way that we thought it might, while we've been in that spectrum acquisition in the sense that nationwide, continuous blocks of 20 megahertz are the beachfront property of spectrum, and the mid-band spectrum, like S-band, is a good cross between propagation and capacity. And so that $5 million (sic) [$5 billion] has gone into an asset that is strategic for us in a number of ways and enhances, potentially, our video business around the country. That same $5 billion, we could have spent it growing our DISH video subscriber business. And we certainly could have probably grown our subscriber base by 5 million customers if we spent another $5 billion to do that. But we don't think those extra 5 million customers would have nearly the value strategically or from a shareholder value perspective. So we chose to spend money in spectrum. And of course, as Tom said, there's future auctions coming up, including the one he didn't mention, that we will potentially have interest in, which is the 600 megahertz auction, which is perhaps a couple of years away. So we also could have spent that money in a number of ways. But when we looked at the return on that investment, from a strategic and economic shareholder value, we could have bought back our stock as an example. We could have paid another dividend. I mean, we look at those things every day almost to think about -- and we've been focused on about the same conclusion for the last 5 years. So absent tax law change, where we paid some dividends to our shareholders, we've gone out and made an investment. We think that's a good investment. It's -- we think it's yet to be seen. You can put your own number on spectrum. But I think some analysts have started to correctly point out that downlink spectrum is materially more valuable than uplink spectrum. And the reason is people use downlink spectrum as much as 10x more than they use uplink spectrum. So obviously, the -- when you look at it, we have as much downlink spectrum, potentially, as everybody besides Sprint -- other than Sprint. So that's pretty interesting from our perspective. Second, spectrum in 20-megahertz blocks is more valuable than spectrums in 10-megahertz blocks. Third, spectrum is nationwide, and the same frequency band is more valuable then [ph] spectrum is chopped up. But when you can have AWS-4 spectrum nationwide, you're not chopped up into -- to PCS and 1 -- AWS-1 and all the different bands. So -- and then I think, to some extent, the spectrum is -- it's a virgin spectrum, so as technology changes, right -- as an example, the way you might build your network today, you might be more cloud-based. You might have less hardware and smarts at the tower so you can be less -- it costs less to build out your tower and you're more flexible in how you can build your network. So we can take advantage of those technological changes. And in fact, perhaps, G5 makes more sense than where it is today. So when you -- we all know that when you upgrade your capacity, that you have to be backward-compatible and you have to -- we still have networks that are running 2G and EDGE and GPS RS. And that capacity can't get freed up until you wean people off those networks, which takes years and years and years. And then you have to run those networks at somewhat an uneconomical way. So we think we're well positioned. We have options. Obviously, the -- it was long-winded answer, but obviously, the Time Warner-Comcast potential transaction will shift this industry in a way that concentrates most broadband in a nationwide player, video in another nationwide player, content, with over 30 million subscribers owned by a company. So that's going to send a seismic shift across our industry in ways that maybe we can't predict today because it ultimately will depend on where that goes from a regulatory point of view. But it's certainly -- but certainly, we are a company that has options. And it's our job as management to look at that strategically for the company and for the -- ultimately, the economic benefit of our shareholders and for our consumers and for our employees. And that's what we, that -- I like where we are.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe really quickly, Tom, can you explain -- maybe I'm a little na\u00efve here but the sort of late technical issue that you found with LightSquared that had you pulling back? And then for Robert, again, maybe I'm just -- don't really understand this. But can you talk about the economic impact of the SATS transaction? Will you be consolidating the full consumer subscriber base there? And how do we think about that?","Thomas A. Cullen","It's Tom. I can't comment on any of the LightSquared diligence process or anything beyond what I've already said due to the ongoing litigation.","Robert E. Olson","And Phil, this is Robert. With regard to the tracking stock, that'll be still on the EchoStar side. That -- they will do the financials. What I mentioned, the impacts -- the only impacts that we'll see on our income statement will be if they declare a dividend or they -- or we decide that we should impair that -- those assets. So the satellites will have impact [ph] because we will have lease expense and then less depreciation.","Charles W. Ergen","I may have missed this. This is Charlie. I may have missed this but -- because I was out doing the auction. But there is another impact. The transaction does lower our EBITDA short term. Does that...","Robert E. Olson","That's right.","Charles W. Ergen","I assume you mentioned that. I don't -- I might have missed it.","Robert E. Olson","We have $148 million of satellite lease expense and $40 million less depreciation. But the $148 million of lease expense would lower our EBITDA.","Charles W. Ergen","So short term, there's a hit to EBITDA. For those who analyze EBITDA and value on some multiple, if that's the kind of analysis you're doing, that will have an impact.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sorry, you did say it clearly. I got confused later.","Operator","And your next question comes from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, Charlie, you just said downlink is more valuable than uplink. What would you say the ratio is here? We've heard a range between 2:1 and 9:1, so just curious where you come out.","Charles W. Ergen","It's -- I think it's probably in that range, I mean, right? I think it's clearly more than 2:1, and I don't know if it's 9:1. The carriers themselves would be better people to ask because they got real data. But most of the data that I'm looking at today is at least 5:1 in terms of usage, so in a generalized fashion. And I think the key will be where the trends are -- where the trend's going. Are people continuing to request more information? Video is probably the biggest data growth area, and that tends to be one-way downlink. So you can make the case that the trend continues for more downlink. But there are people that have real numbers, but I would -- I feel safe in saying that if you are a -- if you're going to be a wireless carrier or if you're a wireless carrier in the United States today, your -- one of your problems is that you are paired up with downlink and uplink spectrum. And the way that the market's evolved over time and where it looks like it's going, you need more downlink than uplink.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then Robert, is there -- with the transfer of the satellites to EchoStar, is there any impact on CapEx?","Robert E. Olson","Marci, no, there wouldn't be any CapEx impact. As I mentioned in my talking notes, the -- any difference between the historical cost basis and the value of those satellites would just be recorded as additional paid in capital, but there will be no CapEx impact.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last question. Joe, you mentioned that the fourth quarter was the most competitive of the year. Did you feel this disproportionately from any particular provider? I mean, we saw some of the numbers. Comcast and I think DIRECTV did pretty well. The telcos didn't. Is that something that you saw as well?","Joseph P. Clayton","No. We were facing the SUNDAY TICKET free program from DIRECTV. And Comcast was very aggressive on the video side, basically, packaging with their broadband. So yes, we did see the pressure from both those companies.","Operator","And your next question comes from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Two if I could. First of all, regarding the Hughes residential business, what was the rationale for buying 80% of it rather than putting in another $150 million, $200 million cash and just buying it all? And second, can you update us on your thoughts on over-the-top delivery and if you think there's a role to play for the over-the-top service serving customers who potentially couldn't, for one reason or another, get access to the satellite-based service?","Robert E. Olson","James, this is Robert. With regard to the 80%, we and EchoStar both did discounted cash flow evaluation of the assets we were bringing to the exchange. And 80% was indeed the right number if you look at the value of the 5 satellites. Also, among other reasons, this setup was -- the agreement was set up to be a tax-efficient transfer. The other question regarding...","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie on OTT. I think that the OTT is probably going to bring -- first of all, it's going to happen in many forms and fashions. In fact, OTT is already here for a lot of subscribers today, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and it's going to continue to expand because the technology can, in some ways, give you a better customer experience. And this certainly can give a customer who can't afford $100 a month a potential experience. So from a programmer point of view, I think they had to be interested in that to make sure that they're maximizing their revenue. It also is going to bring an unlimited number of competitors into the marketplace because virtually anybody will -- can start up an OTT service. So we have -- so from our perspective, we have to -- as Joe mentioned, we have to be able to give the consumer the best experience, that video experience. And of course, we know that's inside your home, looking at a big TV. We know that's inside your home, looking at a tablet or phone. We know what it looks like outside your home. And so we put together the assets and technology that allows us to give you a good -- a great consumer experience in all those metrics. Part of our wireless strategy, right, could play into that because, obviously, when you're outside the home, in many instances, the only way you can get video is in a wireless environment, and you can't always count on WiFi to do that for you. So we're going to -- we will continue to look at it. Programmers have been fairly reluctant to transition, but obviously, a number of programmers and content owners are looking at that and coming up -- and they're each going to have maybe a different strategy. And we're open to talking to all of them about things that work for both our companies. And so we'll continue to do it. But there's nothing imminent about a nationwide OTT service that I can see based on where programmers are today. But when they're ready, we'll be ready.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Follow-up on that briefly, if you wanted to roll out the existing video package you offer but deliver it purely via broadband rather than satellite, do your programming agreements allow you to do that? Or are they platform restricted?","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. The -- all of our programming agreements are different. So I would say, in general, some of those rights exist today. Some of those rights don't exist.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I've got a little bit of cognitive dissonance, so maybe you guys can help me out. This year's stock is up 5% or something. EchoStar is down 7%. Both of you have said on your calls that there will be no impact to the income statement as a result of the EchoStar-DISH transaction that you announced. If you were in our shoes and made a living trying to figure out which way stocks are going to move based on financial numbers that are reported, what guidance would you give us to try and figure out, a, whether this was a good deal over time? I understand it was a even transfer according to your DCF. But over time, if nothing changes, how would you suggest we -- the buy side or the sell side try and figure this out in terms of how much value is added over time?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, this is Charlie. I think that you should look at it the same way that EchoStar and DISH looked at it. And the DISH board independent committee looked at that and said, \"This is positive for DISH long term.\" And the EchoStar board looked at it separately and said, \"This is positive for EchoStar.\" In other words, it's a win-win situation in terms of the transaction. So I guess I would say the market probably has it wrong on the EchoStar side today, but only time will tell. If the numbers you just gave me -- in other words, I would look at that as an investor personally that this is a positive -- if that was the only thing I was looking at, that this is a positive transaction for both companies. And it's a lot of strategic reasons why that is, and a lot of time went into this but probably too detailed to try to explain. But you -- I think you have to give the management and the board members credit that they're making good decisions for their shareholders and that neither one of them would do something that was negative for their shareholders knowingly. So I look at it as a positive transaction for both of them and gets them more aligned in the business units that they're in and focused on.","Robert E. Olson","And Jason, this is Robert. I just want to clarify one thing you said, which was, as we discussed, this will have an impact on DISH's EBITDA in the short term because the [indiscernible] ...","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Oh, I understand. Yes, yes, I get -- the satellite lease stuff is so straightforward. I think where everyone is struggling is this wholesale, retail change that's happening on the broadband side, the transponders side.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, I mean -- this is Charlie. I think people maybe on the EchoStar side don't understand. The wholesale side of the business remains and the satellites remains on -- at the EchoStar side. And there are very good economics on the wholesale side. There's good economics on the retail side, too, but the retail side has SAC, right? So you're investing in the customer, right? That's not -- you don't have that issue on the wholesale side. So from a -- if your business is building and launching in satellites and you primarily deal with engineers and big companies and wholesale agreements, and you can take your capital and build more satellites. And where you're probably the leader in the world in satellite broadband, and you can build more satellites around the world because you free up cash flow that you're not spending on SAC. That can make a lot of sense from an EchoStar perspective. From a DISH perspective, if you're already dealing with consumers, right, and you're -- and you have a rural focus and your roots are rural, and you're always trying to enhance your products for rural America, right, and you're already out talking to customers, perhaps, customers who have -- who can't get broadband today, this makes a lot of sense to be more invested in the retail side of the business. So that's the general rationale. How that translates into the way analysts look at things, who look just at numbers, I think you might see a distortion for a day or 2 until people probably -- or maybe a quarter or 2 until people see what -- why that makes logical sense from both companies' perspectives. But it truly is, in my opinion, a win-win situation.","Operator","And your next question comes from Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","You had 2 trials for fixed wireless broadband, one with nTelos and one with Sprint. Can you just talk about what the experience has been for the consumer and, I guess, the longer-term scalability of those ventures versus something like the dishNET?","Thomas A. Cullen","Yes. Amy, this is Tom. The Sprint trial has not launched yet, and the nTelos trial is still in the early stages. I will tell you that's driven by we're waiting for band 41 radios, which will allow for more bandwidth to be used to test the business model. So while we're optimistic about it, until we get better results in terms of -- I shouldn't say better, more complete results once we have a chance to launch it more broadly, then we'll be able to ascertain the scalability of it.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. And this is Charlie. The other thing -- the other part of it that maybe is not evident but is important is that we are betting that fixed broadband in smaller communities is going to make economic sense, in part, because a lot of people aren't -- that's not where the big guys are going. That's probably not where Comcast and Time Warner are going, right? And because -- but you can build a tower and do it pretty -- and cover people pretty economically. In one of the advantages in the tracking stock transaction that we did with EchoStar is that as you already are going to customers for satellite broadband to the extent that those customers are in your footprint on the tower, right, that's going to be a better experience than satellite. So you kind of go -- as the consumer, you'd like to have fiber to the home, right, or coax to the home like cable does. That'd be your first choice, right? Second choice would probably be fixed wireless, and third choice would be satellite broadband. So from an economic and a customer -- in terms of the speed and latency and amount of data throughput as a customer can get, that's the way it stack ranks, right? And as you get more rural, the only economic way -- if you get really rural, the only economic way is satellite. But there's an interim step where fixed broadband makes a lot of sense. And then, obviously, for the vast majority of densely populated high-income homes, a cable of some sort makes sense. And we're so just preparing ourselves -- we're making an investment in customers that we already have, which tend to be more rural and in technologies where the big guys aren't going. I don't see Google Fiber fibering up Pueblo, Colorado. They're going to Austin, Texas. Well, there's a reason, right? Pueblo is not as economic. So fixed broadband may make sense in Pueblo, Colorado. So there's a strategy here. There's a method to our madness. It's more encompassing than just the trials, but we've got to prove it to ourselves because once you prove the model, you can expand on the model. But we haven't proven the model yet because we're right in the midst of a technology change. Sprint's talked a lot about their technology change and how they're upgrading the network. That also affects how we do broadband.","Operator","And your next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Two questions, Charlie, if I could. One is just a very near-term one. You have with your MVDDS spectrum, I think, some build-out requirements for this year, if I'm not mistaken. So maybe if you could just update us with your thinking on that. And then, I guess, a more industry-level question. Charlie, can you talk about your views of usage-based pricing? As you think about entering the wireless broadband business, for obvious reasons, you would imagine that it would probably be hard to sell that product to consumers with limitations on usage. But as a network operator of a sort, I can imagine you philosophically sort of being aligned with the idea of trying to charge for consumption and transport. So I was wondering if I could just hear your thoughts about the idea of charging for consumption for broadband.","Charles W. Ergen","Okay. On the MVDDS, strategically, we think that, that -- those frequencies, which are mirror images of our satellite DBS frequencies, but they're terrestrially based. We think that, that has -- is a critical strategic component of where we'd like to go with backhaul for our wireless networks, and so we think it's strategically important to us. We have been doing testing on that. And we'll be, obviously, working with the regulatory agencies on the timing of when we can do that and for extensions of time on those licenses. On the usage, I'd say it a probably different way. I think the way we approach everything that we do is we -- is in a wireless side, we will try to build the most economical network so that the cost of transporting a bit to you, whether it be video via satellite or whether it be in a wireless basis, we get -- we bring the cost of that down by making the ecosystem make sense in terms of more balance between uplink and downlink, having the right frequencies, using the right technology on towers, even the most economical use of backhaul so that when you ultimately get it as a consumer, right, our cost is less than our competition. Therefore, we can give you a better experience at a lower cost, right? And that's how we approach it. And the economics of a customer who uses 100 gigs of data versus a customer who uses 2 gigs of data a month is different. And I think that most economic animals would say there's going to be a difference in price for those 2 guys. Having said that, other people may have high fixed cost in their network, and their network may not be fully utilized. And so you may see things like T-Mobile's been able to do because of that, where they might give those customers exactly the same price. And so I think it depends on a lot of different factors as to how you might go about -- how you might look at it. But I think the key thing is that the thing that will drive -- the thing that will ultimately drive innovation and will drive the best consumer experience will be competition. And as long as you've got robust competition, it'll find the right level. And we look at it and say, \"If it finds the right level, we better be very efficient the way we do it.\" Right? We can't go -- I would be hesitant to go invest in copper broadband because that's not going to be as efficient as wireless or it's not going to be as efficient as fiber, right, or fiber to the curb. So you have to look at long term. Whilst today it might make sense economically, but long term, that's probably not where I would personally go, right? So that's how we look at it. And it's going to be driven, hopefully, by competition, and the best man will win or best woman or best company.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Charlie, can I just follow up with one more question? Because you just mentioned wireline, and it triggered for me one of your more memorable comments about the pay-TV business might be on a trajectory to look something like wireline telecom. Can you just update us on your thoughts there? And you talked about your kids thought you were crazy to be in the pay-TV business. Has that -- have those views evolved over the last couple of years? Or have they just been underscored by developments?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, I mean, I think we talked about this about 5 years ago, and so look -- we're starting to -- we said when we invest $800 in a customer and you make $2,000, that's a pretty investment -- pretty easy investment. But when you invest $800 in a customer and you make $900, maybe you should look -- and the customer's only worth $900 [ph] maybe you should look at other investments. And I think that, that's become pretty clear to people and -- or maybe will become clear to people. It became clear to us a long time ago. So obviously, the video business -- in my opinion, the video business, for a monthly subscription of $80 to $100 dollars a month, is a mature business. And we're losing a whole generation of individuals who aren't going to buy into that model because they only want one particular show or they want to watch the show wherever they can or they want to watch it on their schedule. And so that generation is not signing up to satellite or cable or phone video today. And so obviously, you'd like to kind of have your cake and eat it too, and make sure that you come up with products that you can engage that new generation. And as the older generation declines, then you're going to have to figure out other ways to grow your business. And that's why we've taken the track that we've taken, right? At some point in time, at some point in time, the video business, as we know today, will change dramatically enough that it will go from the mature -- the current business will go from mature business to a declining business, right? And hopefully, we'll make up for that, right, in an over-the-top business or a wireless business or other businesses that make sense. But we have fought the urge to sit on a conference call here and tell you we've got a bunch of uneconomical subs, right? You couldn't figure out we're uneconomical, but we could, and that's why we've taken a little bit different approach than some of our competition and only because we're long-term equity holders and so we can afford to do that. I mean, I don't know whether we're right or not, but it's the best personal investment I know I can make based on the most sound logic, strategy that I can think of. And we could be wrong. And we haven't been shy about sharing that opinion, by the way, even though -- I mean, what Chairman gets on a conference call that says, \"We're in a mature business\"? Everybody's talking about the future and all these things they're going to do and this and that, right? But they don't normally say their business is mature. We've been saying it for 5 years. And quite frankly, it looks like it's -- it hasn't declined like I thought -- it hasn't gone into a decline mode. I would have thought 5 years ago, we'd be in decline mode now, and that doesn't appear yet, although odds are it's going to happen.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bryan Kraft with Evercore.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I had a couple of questions just to clarify on the EchoStar deal. Is anything changing in how EchoStar runs its retail broadband business? Or are you just getting a share of the economics now? And is there any change in your satellite broadband economics aside from the equity participation? And then the other question I wanted to ask is, Charlie, what do you think the Comcast, Time Warner Cable transaction means for potential DBS consolidation?","Robert E. Olson","Bryan, this is Robert. Nothing is a changing in the way that EchoStar runs the Hughes retail business. They will continue to run it as they have. And our economics are -- on the dishNET business haven't changed. The only change is we extended our agreement with Hughes out till 2024.","Charles W. Ergen","And on the second part of your question, I guess, I would say it certainly doesn't hurt the case for consolidation within the satellite providers. I mean, obviously, if you take the #1 and #4 providers and put them together, it would be hard to see why you couldn't put the #2 and #3 providers together. And in fact, the 1 and 4 provider becoming -- going together, I think, puts a pressure -- puts pressure on everybody in the video business and the broadband business in a way that's a bit unprecedented. I don't know how that shakes out, and I don't know -- I don't think we've thought about it enough internally to understand how -- what the implications of that merger is. But there's nothing that I can see that's positive about it for anybody in the video or broadband or content business, right? If you're in the video distribution business, the content business or broadband business, I -- and your name is not Comcast and Time Warner, I don't see anything positive.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just ask one follow-up on the broadband side, too. Robert, you talked about the satellite lease expense eventually or starting to come down as the satellites reach end of life. How long does it take for that satellite lease expense to sort of bottom and normalize? And any sense as to what level that is? I mean, does it get back to, say, the fourth quarter '13 run rate as sort of a normalized run rate?","Robert E. Olson","Bryan, in our 10-K, we listed out the satellite lease commitments over the next several years, and it stays fairly steady at a $15 million per month rate for the next couple of years. And then after that, it starts declining.","Operator","And your next question comes from Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","So Charlie, if I can stay on that DBS consolidation theme, how would you -- I mean, Comcast and Time Warner Cable talked about not competing in any kind of market the potential argument in favor of the deal? And how would you react to the point that the #1 and #4, as you mentioned -- I know you said it's not good for anyone else but them. But the #2 and #3 do compete, now you guys and DirecTV, so in a context of a possible DISH-DirecTV merger, how would you respond to that?","Charles W. Ergen","I think you -- first of all, I think it's incorrect that Time Warner and Comcast don't compete. They certainly do. They -- as an example, they compete for content. And when they can combine and go buy content, they can go buy content cheaper than anybody else. The best example would be retransmission consent, where broadcasters have talked about taking the rates up. But no broadcaster could ever suffer -- let me put it this way. If Time Warner -- Comcast and Time Warner had taken down [ph] CBS, the outcome would have been exactly the opposite. CBS probably would have been paying them to keep it up as opposed to Time Warner paying CBS, right? So that -- DISH doesn't have that kind of scale, right? So we actually pay CBS. And we send our check every month with a smile. But Comcast-Time Warner won't have to send a check, right? So you end up with that kind of stuff, you end up with -- so you just end -- there is a ton of competition between those people. And so I think that's misleading for that. Obviously, the regulators have a tough job, because there's obviously 2 regulatory bodies that will look at any transaction. And Justice will look at it with one set of eyes and the FCC would look at it with a different set of eyes. And consolidation between cable guys is different than consolidation between satellite guys, and everybody would look at it differently. But at the end of the day, it still boils down to if somebody's going to get to over 30 million subscribers, and all the advantages that go with that, and a virtual monopoly in broadband, right? Time Warner Cable -- I mean, Time Warner-Comcast, for all practical purposes, will become a nationwide video provider. They're going to cover 80-something percent of the homes, right? They will become a nationwide broadband provider, right? That's materially different than the environment we are in today. So how people look at that, look, the agencies are staffed with very intelligent people. And they'll look at it and make -- I would think that they, as they have always tried to do, make the best decision for competition and consumers in the end, regardless of what transaction they're looking at.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","That's helpful. Just to -- another follow-up question, if you don't mind. I wanted to clarify on your philosophy about AutoHop compensation. There seems to be a suggestion, Charlie, that you guys are now willing to somehow compensate big broadcasters for that, sounds like a radical change in your philosophy. So my question is if that premise is correct, a, does that open up the door for other broadcasters to request the same? And b, how do you strike the economics from that kind of arrangement?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, this is Charlie. I think maybe the press has got this wrong. But we understand that broadcasters have a dual revenue stream, right, and that advertising is an important part of what they do, and without advertising, the consumer would pay more or we would pay more. So it's -- but we also understand that the reality is customers skip commercials, right? And one of the reasons consumers skip commercials is because the commercial's not important to them, right? So if you're a 15-year-old girl, you may not be looking at a Mercedes-Benz commercial with the idea of buying a Mercedes-Benz, right? You might be looking for something else. So what we've really said is -- and we've really got no traction with broadcasters about trying to change the model to make commercials more meaningful to consumers, which we think is more money for everybody. The Hopper technology allows us to do that, and therefore -- and we also understand consumers skip commercials, so we made it easier for them. But we've also been in dialogue with all the broadcasters that says, really, we believe there's more money involved here, you can either have customers skip commercials on everybody's platform, including ours, or we can start putting more targeted advertising, that may be less advertising but more targeted advertising that makes more sense. And I've always thought the Hulu model was a pretty good one, where if you watch something the next day, you can watch it, but there's maybe 2 or 3 minutes of commercials instead of 15 or 18 minutes of commercials. And so -- and we know how to target that. So that's the kind of dialogue that we think is interesting where it's a positive for broadcasters, positive consumers and a positive for us. And so that's the dialogue that I think that we are engaged in and are willing to be engaged in. And perhaps we didn't go about it exactly right the way we introduced the Hopper, and in hindsight, I might have done that a different way. But we have to think about consumers. We are in a competitive environment, and we have to think about the total experience. So I don't think commercial skipping is going to go away.","Operator","And we will now take our final question from the analyst community. [Operator Instructions] And our final analyst question comes from Tom Eagan with Northland Securities.","Thomas W. Eagan - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","I have 2 questions on strategy. First, on Google, they've indicated their interest to extend their fiber to 9 cities. Charlie, any thoughts about talking with Google about some kind of video data bundle? And then I have a follow-up.","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I think that what Google is doing is very interesting, but they're also providing video to their customers. So to the extent that they want to have the conversation, we're certainly willing to. But they appear to be, at least what I can see is they appear to be doing the whole bundle themselves. Again, and our focus has been more -- I think that the big cities are going to have plenty of people interested in perhaps looking at broadband. But we've kind of focused on those less than top 100 markets which is why we're looking particularly at fixed broadband and satellite broadband, because we just think those people are being left out. But we're happy to have discussions with Google on anything, right? But we're a pretty small company compared to them, and they normally set the rules of what they're doing.","Thomas W. Eagan - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","And then about Aereo, I won't ask you, of course, to comment on the upcoming court case. But how does it affect DISH? Whether Aereo wins or loses, how does that affect DISH?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, look, we're impressed with Aereo's innovation, right? But I think we've said continually on these calls that our first preference in life is to work with our current partners. So before we go out and work with a new partner, we try to work with the current partner. So certainly, most of what we are doing today, regardless of how Aereo turns out, is to try to continue to work with our current broadcasting partners. And we have hundreds of them across the country. And so that's our kind of first focus. To the extent that a broadcasting partner doesn't want to work with us and wants to do something that's uneconomical for our consumers, then obviously, we are excited to look at the things, the kind of innovation that people like Aereo have brought to the marketplace. But it's -- we are a lot more focused on our current partners than trying to go out and get new partners. So I think Aereo, like anything else, there's a difference in opinion between them and the broadcasters as to a very complex set of laws and copyright. And we've been on both ends of that -- of those kind of controversies. And I think it's hard -- I think it's really impossible to predict, other than I think Aereo has started the conversation about a better consumer experience. And I think that's an important one to continue, regardless whether it's the broadcasters themselves or whether it's start-up companies like Aereo. I think, ultimately, the consumer will benefit from a better -- from technology and innovation, and Aereo should be credited with that. That's -- they have shown a lot of innovation that broadcasters themselves, in my opinion, could do as well. So we're -- we hope they're all successful. And if they're successful, I think it will help us.","Operator","And we will now take questions from members of the media. [Operator Instructions] And our first media question comes from Scott Moritz with Bloomberg.","Scott Moritz","Charlie, question on Time Warner-Comcast. Do you have a position, or would you say that you oppose the deal? And if not, does it give you some sort of optionality in terms of M&A?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I don't think we have -- we understand the deal enough to come out with a formal position, right? I mean, as a consumer, I can say, gee, I hope my broadband -- I'm worried my broadband rates go up. I'm worried my -- I'm worried about concentration of content where I may only have one choice of content in the future so -- from an economic point of view. So I worry about those things, but I don't know enough about the transaction itself until we see some of the filings. And I'm sure that we'll have an opinion at some point in time. Obviously, as I said earlier, I don't think -- when you put the #1 and #4 companies together, I think it certainly increases the risk to everybody else who is in the content, broadband or video distribution business. There's not any question about that, right? If you put United Airlines together with Southwest, you're going to put pressure on American, right, so -- or the bus or the trains or cars, I mean, you're going to put pressure on people so -- transportation business. So there is -- I'm sure boardrooms across the country in the content and video distribution business and the broadband business, people are having discussions about how it impacts them. And certainly, that's no different here at DISH.","Scott Moritz","Great. On the flip side of that, was it -- was there -- is there -- give you leverage to maybe pursue deals maybe in -- along the lines of broadband or wireless that you might not have had before?","Charles W. Ergen","I don't think leverage is the right word. I think the way we look at everything is that we will be facing realistically a much more challenging environment if that merger is approved. And we have to look at, a, how will we compete in that environment and what steps would we have to take to compete in that environment? And the second part of that is how do we continue to make -- anything that we would decide to do, if we decided to do something, would that be better for consumers or worse for consumers, and obviously, long term, it has to be better for consumers. And so we'd have to look -- we have kind of 2 challenges. Is there anything that we can do as a company that's better for consumers, right? And is there anything that we can look at that's not only better for consumers but gives us the ability to compete better as a company. And if you could combine those 2 things where you could compete, where you could enhance your competitive status and you could do something for consumers you otherwise might not be able to do, then we've got to seriously look at that. And I would think that there are potentially a number of options that our company and our board will have to look at. And Tom and his team are challenged with coming up with those things. And so maybe the company -- the question's better addressed to him. But I didn't see him working at midnight last night. Maybe tomorrow night he will be.","Thomas A. Cullen","Well, as I said earlier, management is assessing it. We're obviously concerned about it, and we're putting together options, recommendations and potential impacts, and we'll be sharing that with the board shortly.","Scott Moritz","You say you're putting together something. Is this for the board or for the regulators that are reviewing it?","Thomas A. Cullen","We'll first have the discussion with our board. But it's our role as management to understand the potential impacts, evaluate potential options and share that with the board for consideration of next steps. But at the same time, part of that process is determining our strategy and our position in terms of the regulatory environment.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. I won't put words in Tom's mouth. But what he just said is what we'd normally do that as a day-to-day basis. But I would say that there's perhaps a heightened urgency given the magnitude of that particular deal.","Operator","And your next question comes from Lisa Richwine with Reuters.","Lisa Richwine","I wondered if you can give us an update on the status of your negotiations with Disney over carriage of their networks.","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. Again, believe it or not, nothing has changed since last quarter, but we're cautiously optimistic that we're going to get there with Disney. We're -- I think that the agreement is important enough to both companies that each side is taking time to get it right. To the extent that it's a long-term deal, it makes it more difficult because neither Disney or DISH can predict the future many, many years out, particularly when it comes to technology. So that's why it's taken maybe a little longer than any of us would like. But I'm cautiously optimistic that we're going to get to an agreement with them before the next conference call.","Lisa Richwine","Okay. Well, on the last conference call, you said you don't date everybody you marry. How long do you keep dating before you decide that there's not going to be a marriage?","Charles W. Ergen","Because sometimes you ask them out and they turn you down, and you see them out with somebody else, right? It just happens sometimes, right?","Lisa Richwine","Have any new issues cropped up since the last quarter?","Charles W. Ergen","I think -- I don't -- I'd say, in general, there aren't new issues. In general, there are just changes in technology and changes in the way people think about what might happen, maybe slight changes in strategy. But no, I think it's been -- I think it's just a complex deal, where we're trying to look out in the future. And to Disney's credit, they probably are -- they are probably the leader in looking at technology, in part, because I think their CEO has been on the board of Apple, and he just has a better feel for it, technology. And they have -- they've looked at it in a way that others have not. And my expectation is they're going to be a leader in the technology field. And if they are, it makes it more difficult to predict and write that down on piece of paper so it's fair to both parties.","Operator","And your next question comes from Shalini Ramachandran with Wall Street Journal.","Shalini Ramachandran","So one question on potential idea of DISH and Direct merging. Previously, you guys and Direct execs have indicated that there are benefits to consolidation, but you guys have obviously taken different strategic paths, with you guys in wireless and they are kind of resuming [ph] that path. So do you think that's still a big obstacle? Or has the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger, in some ways, would that lessen the amount you think that's a difference between you guys?","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. You'd have to ask DirecTV about those things. I mean, I think that, clearly, we've taken slightly different strategic paths. And therefore, I think it's safe to assume, from a DirecTV perspective, that they may not -- that they certainly could have gotten into wireless space and chose not to or the spectrum space and chose not to. So they obviously probably don't have as much passion for that strategically as we would. And we might have less passion for stock buybacks, which help short term but may not help long term. So yes, there are different strategies there. And that makes -- different strategies don't necessarily make things impossible, but I think that there's a reason why people go different strategies, right? And having said that, obviously, Time Warner-Comcast transaction, the magnitude of that transaction, I would imagine -- I won't speak for DirecTV, but certainly, it makes us look at everything in a different light today at DISH.","Shalini Ramachandran","Got you. One more question if I can. So there are some rumors about, I guess, with Sprint trying to generate [ph] those bid for T-Mobile and regulators have kind of shown that they would be disinclined to bless that, does that open any more doors for DISH with T-Mobile?","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie again. I mean, I think that -- look, I think Sprint is -- I think Sprint has indicated their interest in T-Mobile. And certainly, we've had experienced competing against SoftBank, and we're realistic to know that we are not going to outbid SoftBank in any transaction. I think that SoftBank has conquered us into submission there. So to the extent that they're going after T-Mobile, I don't think you're going to see us engaged in that. I mean, never say never, but I don't think that would be -- if you start -- if are pounding your head against the wall and it hurts, I believe you quit pounding your head against the wall. And I think SoftBank is bigger and stronger than we are.","Operator","And your next question comes from Greg Avery with the Denver Business Journal.","Greg Avery","To touch back on the discussions with Disney. Charlie, you said that there generally aren't any new issues that have arisen since the last time you spoke. But then, talking about Comcast-Time Warner, it changes everything. I'm curious how you -- how a deal like that doesn't set discussions with Disney back to square one?","Charles W. Ergen","I just think -- I guess, that's possible. Your premise is possible. But I think that the -- I think the -- rather than having an effect on our current discussion today, I think it's far enough along that, that's probably not something that either side wants to go back and retread. But certainly, it will make -- I think it will make future discussions with Comcast more interesting, because the balance of power will shift.","Greg Avery","Even for Disney?","Charles W. Ergen","I'm not -- you'd have to ask content owners about that transaction. But I don't see -- again, I will stand by my statement that I see nothing good in that transaction for content owners other than NBC, all right, other than Comcast. I see nothing good in that transaction for content owners, broadband providers or video distribution companies. That's life, right?","Operator","And your next question comes from Amy Maclean with CableFAX.","Amy Maclean","Charlie, you mentioned the advantages that Comcast and Time Warner would have when it comes to combining to buy content, including in retrans commission consent. Does any of that trickle down to you and other MVPDs?","Charles W. Ergen","My concern would be that it's just the opposite. They've got to make -- if you're CBS and you are normally getting -- I'm going to make this number up, right, because I don't know the number, and you're getting $1 from Time Warner. And you go into your next negotiation and you're getting -- and you're paying $1 or getting 0, you got to make that $1 up. Where are you going to make the $1 up? You go to the #7, #8, #6, #5, #4, #3, #2, #1 providers and say, we need $1.50, right? So I don't see how that helps us.","Amy Maclean","Okay. Is the same, though, with cable networks though? I mean, wouldn't MFNs come into play at some point?","Charles W. Ergen","Look, if -- that would be a very good condition, which is, you should be an MFN for all video providers against Comcast, right? I think that's a reasonable -- that would be a reasonable concession for the Comcast team to make.","Amy Maclean","And if I just have one follow-up...","Charles W. Ergen","And I'm sure they -- and I'm sure that, that's the first thing in their list that they're going to propose. I mean, I think -- look, I think you have to be realistic that the merger is of enormous scale. But ultimately, you got to -- ultimately, the way I believe Washington will look at it is not -- they'll look at it as it relates, ultimately, to consumers, right, and is there a fair and level playing field for competition so the consumers ultimately benefit. And all I know is my experience in Washington is people and the regulatory agencies are very confident and very dedicated. Sometimes, politics plays a role that perhaps we all wish it didn't. But it's a lot of hardworking people that ultimately, even -- we've lost a lot more than we've won. But even when we've lost, from a personal point of view, I understand why they're making the decisions that they're making. And I think we just have to trust in their judgment at this point, and also look at it as it relates to our company and how we will react to that.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time, so I'll turn the call back to our presenters.","Charles W. Ergen","Thank you. We appreciate you joining.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"7028":["Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) Q3 2014 Earnings Call November  4, 2014 12:00 PM ET","Executives","R.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DISH Network Corporation Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Dodge, you may begin your call.","R. Stanton Dodge","Thanks, Nicole, and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Jason is out today, so this is Stan Dodge, I'm the General Counsel here at DISH. I'm joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman; Joe Clayton, our CEO and President; Tom Cullen, EVP of Corporate Development; Bernie Han, our COO; Steve Swain, our CFO; and Paul Orban, our Controller.","Before I turn it over to Joe, we need to do our Safe Harbor disclosures. We ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in your reports. We also do not allow audio taping and ask that you respect that.","All statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements, which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from historical results and from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a list of those factors, please refer to the front of our 10-Q.","All cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as being applicable to any forward-looking statements that we make, wherever they appear. You should carefully consider the risks described in our reports and should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which we assume no responsibility for updating.","Given that the AWS-3 Anti-Collusion rules are in effect, we will not be talking about wireless today and we will not answer any questions about wireless. I suggest that you refer to our prior earnings calls and public filings for information related to our wireless plans.","With respect to the AWS-3 auction itself, all we can say is that DISH filed an application to participate as a potential bidder for those spectrum assets and that the FCC, on October 30, found that DISH is a qualified bidder for the auction. And with that out of the way, I'll turn it over to Joe.","Joseph P. Clayton","Thanks, Stanton. Good afternoon to those of you on the East Coast, and good morning to our West Coast participants. Our first order of business today is to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Steve Swain. Now Steve has been with DISH for nearly 4 years. His first management position was as our Vice President of Corporate Financial Analysis and Planning. Most recently, he served as our Senior Vice President of Programming. He has all the proper education and experience to be successful in his new senior executive role.","Now after a discussion with Steve, we thought that we'd try something different on today's call. Since most of you all have undoubtedly read our third quarter 2014 financial results press release or 10-Q, we will immediately open up the phone for your questions. The first part of the Q&A session will be for our Wall Street analysts, and then time permitting, we'll have some time for the press.","With that, we'll get started.","Nicole?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions for Charlie. Charlie, you've always provided a really honest assessment of the core business. So can you speak to the health, I guess, of the pay-TV business, and then -- in general, and then to your satellite business, specifically? And then the second question is, we're reading about LightSquared and your potential interest should this plan go through. How would you think about monetizing your investment in LightSquared if you get it?","Thomas A. Cullen","Marci, this is Tom. Let me step in here. As you and, I think, everyone on the call knows that DISH is not a party to the LightSquared transaction. It's a private -- Charlie has a private investment in LightSquared. And so I don't think this forum is appropriate for the Q&A regarding LightSquared, and I'd appreciate everybody's understanding on that.","Charles W. Ergen","Okay. So this is going to be a great call. We can't talk about a lot -- few things. But -- because of the auction and other things. But on the core business, I don't think anything's changed in terms of what we've been saying for the last 3 or 4 years, which is the pay-TV business, as you know it from MVPD linear kind of business, is a mature business. It continues to, in a way, surprise us that it has held up as well it has and continues to be a solid business for DISH and continues to hold up pretty well. There's certainly some variations quarter-to-quarter, depending on what other people do in the marketplace or what we do, whether successful or unsuccessful. But it's been really, really pretty steady for the last 4 or 5 years for us, with some pressure on margins, obviously. The -- but what's different maybe than 5 years ago or 4 years ago is now, there is -- for us, we think there's a pretty clear path to actually grow the business. So instead of a mature business or maybe even a slightly declining business, we think we can actually be in a growth mode. And there are a couple of ways that we can do that, that we can talk about today. One is the advent of OTT, where I think we're well positioned. And that -- and it will enable us to go after customers who aren't paying for TV today. So working with our programming partners, we go after people who aren't in the pay-TV universe today, and we know that that's growing by 4 or 5 million a year and probably will continue to grow and probably accelerate. The second thing is broadband and general satellite broadband, first and foremost, where that's been a pretty good business and where we made a transaction that we think positions ourself to take some of those economics and some of those efficiencies with EchoStar, which you may have other questions about. And don't get too surprised by the lower number this quarter, the lower trend the last couple of quarters because there's various reasons for that, and those will be -- with new satellite launches in the industry in the next 1.5 years, you're going to see some acceleration there. And then -- and maybe Tom will talk about later, we think that the fixed broadband business, where we're trialing with both nTelos and Sprint, is -- we're cautiously optimistic that that's a real business as well. So we think we have an opportunity to grow the business beyond wireless and just in our core business. And our linear business will be mature, will be under some margin pressure, but it's pretty steady. We're fortunate that most of our -- that a lot of our customer base is rural, and they're not as affected as perhaps some of the urban dwellers by the competition in the marketplace.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just have a follow-up on the satellite broadband comment, because as you said, subs came in lighter. Is this a function more of capacity or you're just not marketing the product as much?","Charles W. Ergen","Joe, do you want to take that?","Joseph P. Clayton","Well, first thing, in some of the geographic markets, we are capacity-constrained, places like Texas, even my home state of Kentucky. In that instance, we have pulled back on some of our promotions, especially on promotional discounts, and indeed, trying to raise the credit score since we are limited in supply. So those are the basic factors kind of throttling back some of our broadband growth that we saw last year, when there was a great deal of pent-up demand.","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. I just would add that what happens in satellite broadband is you end up with about half your beams fill up pretty quickly and about half of your beams don't fill up, and some beams there's very little demand at all. And so we've gone through the stage of filling up the -- I mean, literally filling up the beams both from ViaSat and Hughes, of the most popular, which we had 2 or 3 or 4x as much capacity in those markets. So you saw pretty good trends there. Now we don't have the luxury of selling into those beams, although we're getting the cash flow from those beams, which is great. And the sooner you fill them up, the better. But we're more focused on those 50% of the beams that aren't full, and that takes a little bit more effort, and there's just not quite as much demand there. But we can improve the product with speed and amount of capacity that people get. And so we're going through that stage of, from a marketing perspective, not treating all company -- all customers equal and going into those beams that aren't full and giving people actually kind of more bang for their buck, so to speak, and so we're going through that, and that will help. But what really will help will be the launch of the next Hughes satellite, which is just over a year away, and the next ViaSat satellite, which I think is about 1.5 year away, because they're going to triple or quadruple the capacity that we have in the beams that are full, which will kind of open the market back up for us. So it's -- we're fortunate that there is demand for satellite broadband, that it is a product that has a niche in the marketplace. It is a product that has several million customer potential, and it's a business that has pretty good cash flow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet from Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A question for Mr. Ergen. Your investors today that own your stock have a mature cash-generative business and then a raw asset in the spectrum. And my question is, as you migrate towards doing something with the wireless spectrum to turn it into something cash generative, do you give deference to what that would do to your stock in the near term? Or as you're thinking about making decisions, do you sort of say, \"Look, either you're with me over the long run or you're not and I don't really care what happens to my stock price in the near term, we're just going to do what's right?\" And if you do care about what happens, the way The Street reacts to whatever decisions you make, are there certain principles or guideposts that you can share with us of things you could pursue to make that transition less painful for your investors?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. Well, I don't think I'll say anything different that will surprise anybody. But obviously, as a large -- or probably the largest shareholder of DISH, we look at things and we look at things long term. And we certainly do care about the price of the stock. And we like to make good business decisions. But we do -- we're fortunate as a company that we can make longer-term decisions that maybe perhaps The Street doesn't see or investors don't see initially but that people see the value in longer term because we can see things. Obviously, we have a bit more information in terms of how our business runs than perhaps people in the outside looking in. So we care about the stock. We care about the consumer. We care about our employees. We probably first look at consumers, we then look at employees, and we think that's good for our shareholders, and then we look long term. And so the -- all I can give you is the history that the stock, since we've gone public, has appreciated at more than -- compounded more than 20% a year since 19 -- whatever '96 or whenever we went public, '97?","Thomas A. Cullen","'95.","Charles W. Ergen","'95. So 19 years. That's a pretty admirable record to have. We don't see that changing. Although there'd be some years we go -- maybe we go down or we go up. We're not -- we don't really cater to the fund that wants to make a quarterly profit. We more cater to the persons that are long-term investors, and so I think we reward our long-term investors well. I think we'll continue to do that. But it would be incorrect to say we don't care about our stock price. It would be incorrect to somehow say that our stock hasn't done well.","But just a big picture, I like where we're -- strategically, I like where we're positioned. We have a nice solid business. It generates a lot of cash. But we had made a strategic decision 5 or 6 years ago that there was -- that, that business led to other businesses that were video-dependent, right? And we had a core competency in video, why not expand that into things like wireless and broadband? Why not do that? And so we've done that, and so we're not a one-man band. We're not a company who's only got 1 asset. We're not a company who's only got -- we're not a 1-trick pony, and so I think we're well positioned for what I see happening, which is video being a huge consumer of data, both on a fixed and wireless basis, both inside and outside the home. And I think working with our programming partners, we're in a different situation today. We're working with -- where for the first time, we can talk to programmers about how they can make more money as opposed to just what price we pay them on satellite. And so that's a -- so suddenly, you start working on things where both of you can make money that you're not making today, that's a better conversation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So can you give us, Charlie, an update on your over-the-top efforts? How is it going getting content for that? And is that still something that could launch at the end of this year? And then help us think about the impact, I guess, the early impact of turning off the Turner channels. Is that similar to the zombies last year? Or better or worse?","Charles W. Ergen","First, on OTT, we still plan to launch a product before the end of this year. We continue to have -- several major programmers signed up and a lot of interest with some others. We won't sign up everybody because it's kind of a skinnied-down package. So we're going to make sure that we can meet the price point of consumers. We are having some technical issues on our end and some on our programming partners end, in terms of now that we're getting the signals, to put all those signals together and to be able to insert dynamic ads is a fairly complex product -- project, even though we've been working for it for a long time. We're now actually doing it, and when you start doing it, it's not theory anymore, it's actual practicality. And so we are running into a few snags there. But we still plan to meet the year-end -- our self-imposed year-end deadline. But whatever we do, we're going to do it right. I think it's going to be a good product. I think it's going to be a good product for our programming partners, and I think -- I don't think it's going to change the world in the first few months. But I think that it's something that has a long-term path trajectory. And we don't have all the answers, quite frankly, on how the best way to do it is. And so that's why we spend a lot of time with our programming partners to discuss what might work. We also see other strategies out there in OTT. So you see Sony taking a materially different strategy, which is to pretty much sign up -- just to give the whole programming package to people, so very similar to what we do today, except do it through OTT. That's a different strategy. HBO's talked about a different strategy. CBS has talked about potentially a different strategy. So some of those are going to make sense, some of those are going to work, some of those aren't going to work. We hope that our strategy works. And it's not easy to do. It's a lot more than just putting a package out there. There's a lot of technology. There's intellectual property. There's the devices. There's operating system and ease-of-use for consumers. There's billing, there's encryption, there's ad insertion, so there's a lot of pieces to it. But it's very similar to what we did years ago on satellite, a lot of complex things have to come together on that. And then second part of the question was...","Joseph P. Clayton","Turner.","Charles W. Ergen","Oh, Turner. Well, we're disappointed that Turner did not extend the contract -- or contracts. So they did come down. Obviously, when we take something down, we're prepared as a company to leave it down forever. And fortunately or unfortunately, things like CNN are not quite the product that they used to be. You can imagine CNN down on an election night would be a disaster 15 or 20 years ago. But now, it's -- there's plenty of other places for people to get news. In fact, a lot of people get news from -- not from TV anymore, they get it from their devices. So it's not had a major impact on our business yet. I do expect we would ultimately lose some subscribers without Turner programming. We certainly would prefer to get a deal done. But we -- but it -- we have a time frame that we look at, and there comes a point in time, certainly during this month, where if we don't have a deal, we just make a long-term decision to go a different direction. I think you've seen other people do that. I think one of the cable companies did that in relation to Viacom. It's not -- this is not -- I think the industry is changing, so I'm going to give a long-winded answer here. But the industry is changing in a sense that because of the different methods of getting content today, there's about 10 big programming groups, right? The 4 networks, and there's certainly Time Warner, certainly Scripps and Discovery and Viacom and Univision and A&E, and I'm probably leaving some other people out, AMC. So that -- I don't anticipate that the cable companies, satellite companies and phone companies are all going to carry the same 10 groups like it -- it doesn't -- it's not going to be a marketplace where everybody has exactly the same thing and it's just about a price. I think some people are going to say, well, they'll gear more towards families and kids, some people will gear more towards sports, some people will gear more towards general entertainment. And you're in a situation now, for example, with Turner, do you not do a -- if Turner -- we can't -- if we're not going to be in a relationship with Turner, we would not have to raise our prices next year, all right? And that would be slightly cash positive for us from a cash flow perspective. And yes, we'd lose some customers, but we'd save a big, big, big check from a cash flow perspective. And for those people who don't really care about news or cartoons, where we have other news shows and other cartoon shows, would they rather save the money? There's a pretty good chance that they would. And so I think in regional sports, at some point, somebody's not going to carry regional sports because everybody in the marketplace doesn't watch regional sports. And so you'd have a price advantage if you didn't carry regional sports. So I just think that -- I think there's going to be more diversity, particularly when you can get cartoons on -- from Netflix, right, or you can get news from the Internet or you can get a TV show a week later or you can binge-view all the shows in a way that you can't do easily on TV as we do it today. So the world is changing, and some people are going to change with it. And some people are going to be fast followers and some people are just going to do -- just figure it out after somebody tells them what they should be doing. And Disney has been the leader, right? You saw another announcement today where they -- where they're doing something really smart, right, which is you buy a movie from Disney, it will work on Android and it'll work on Apple. So you can watch it on all your devices, whether Apple or Android, without having to pay for it again. Well, that makes sense for a consumer. That is real technology. That's real smart stuff. And I would anticipate that other content people will do smart stuff. And we -- we're going to work with those people who want to do new things and want to do -- to try new things. We hope Turner is going to be one of those. Well, I'm sorry for that.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's all right. This might be a little early, but we think you have CBS coming up toward the end of this year. How does broadcast fit into that ecosystem of must-have or options?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, we don't talk about particular contracts unless it's something like, in Turner's case, it's down so everybody knows about it. But certainly, we've had a good relationship with CBS. Certainly, CBS is a core product when it comes to -- but it's -- CBS, for us, it's an owned and operated station so it's not something that has the impact of Turner -- that Turner would have, where it affects our consumer base across the whole country. And it's interesting because one of the dynamics there is CBS channels are now available over-the-top. So there's an alternative for customers. So on the one hand, that's an interesting business plan. On the other hand, it makes that product less interesting for MVPDs because customers have a choice to get it somewhere else, and not everybody watches that channel, right? Having said that, I think CBS, from a network perspective, I think, has the highest ratings. They certainly have -- I think that they've done a marvelous job with content creation. I think they're the best at that, have been the best at that and certainly are a valued partner, so I would certainly think that they'll -- that you'll see them on DISH.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amy Yong from Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","2 quick questions, one just following up on Jason's question and talking about your stock. You've had a $1 billion share repurchase plan out there for some time. What other factors would make you want to exercise it? And my second question is just on the regulatory changes around broadband and net neutrality and how that might impact your streaming opportunity going forward.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, we have a stock repurchase plan for $1 billion. It's really out there in case the market were to look at things in a way that we think might be short term or -- we wouldn't buy back -- we'd only buy back our stock if we couldn't find something else to do with our money or if we thought the stock was severely undervalued, right? We wouldn't want to buy it back if it was overvalued. So that's why it's out there. I don't anticipate that we're going to buy back stock given the many, many things I think we can do with our capital today that I think will return a greater benefit to our shareholders. But if we -- but certainly, to the extent that you get to a point where you don't have other things to generate value for your shareholders, certainly, it could make sense to buy back your shares under those conditions. And that's why we have a buyback plan there. But we haven't -- I don't think we've done anything on -- in 2 or 3 years because I think we've seen other areas to invest in. On...","Joseph P. Clayton","Regulatory.","Charles W. Ergen","Regulatory. Certainly, net neutrality is an important -- I think it's an important -- it's important to think about it for all consumers. It certainly is important when you think about an over-the-top business. It's certainly an important thing when you think about how we might compete in the marketplace out there. I think it is probably the -- it's the one thing that would probably change our thinking a lot if the Internet wasn't open and that a company like -- we openly are against Comcast-Time Warner. And the reason is they'll control over a majority of the high-speed broadband pipe in America if that merger goes together. That's a national product and there certainly could be a lot of mischief. And it's been shown that conditions just don't work with Comcast. We're still waiting to try to get regional sports in Philadelphia. We're still trying to get OTT rights, even though those conditions that they have to give those things to us. I think for example, Bloomberg, Bloomberg just wanted to put their channel by the news in Comcast. It was a condition on the merger. I think it took them 2 or 3 years of fighting and scrapping just to get a fair placement in the news category. You just don't want one company to control -- have that kind of power over the Internet. And so I think that's a -- that is something that would keep us up at night if something like that were to -- if there would be, I mean, an unregulated marketplace for broadband.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant from ISI.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Talking about the need for possibly segmentation, whether you want to do sports or something else. Can you really talk about what your personalized subscription service is really targeting? I know it's a skinny product, but you've got some of the most expensive channels like ESPN on there. So is there a niche that you're targeting with that product, apart from the fact that it's the millennials or cord cutters? But is there like a target segment that you could sort of identify? And then just on your comments on the Turner channels, obviously TBS and TNT were not part of that. How would you sort of characterize those channels? And is that sort of connected to the cartoon and the CNN channels being off air?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. So on OTT, we really target the 18- to 35-year-old who's not paying for TV today. It's going to skew a higher -- it's going to skew, short term, more male. It's going to skew more urban. It's going to skew more apartments as opposed to homes. And it's certainly going to skew towards sports enthusiasts. And it's going to be a really good product, and there's going to be some advantages to OTT. It's going to be a media product. You don't have to wait for an installation. It's going to be a product that you don't have to worry about recording things, and things are going to be available on the cloud, so -- from the cloud. So it's going to be a little bit more user-friendly, I think, for consumers, and it's going to tie in to your devices. So these are all things we have to learn, right? We have kind of theories about how it all works. My experience has been that some of our theories will be right, some will be wrong. Where we're wrong, we're going to change it and overcome the consumers' objections and then see whether we can grow the pay-TV market in terms of revenue and subscriptions and number of people participating. And that's really the objective. We don't see it going after -- we're not going after the guy who spent $100 a month and got a house and 4 TVs and 3 kids, and he's 55 years old. That is not the target market. On the...","Joseph P. Clayton","TBS, TNT.","Charles W. Ergen","TBS, TNT, certainly to the -- I'm just going to guess that if I were Turner, that if you're not going to carry my CNN and Cartoon Network, that I'm not real excited when your contract's up for you to carry TNT and TBS. They typically try to package all -- bundle all those things together. So I think we have to be prepared that those channels will come down as well. And again, those will be more painful. In fact, I mean, Joe, you're the guy that's getting caught -- I mean, it really has been almost a nonevent at this point.","Joseph P. Clayton","Yes. So far, we haven't had any major churn aspects. But I do believe the popularity of TNT and TBS would force that to change. Think about the NBA on TNT, it's much more popular with our rank-and-file consumers. So, so far, not an issue. Going forward, it would build -- TNT and TBS would cause a major hiccup.","Charles W. Ergen","But a lot of their programming is available elsewhere. It would be a little bit tougher if their original programming was a success like AMC. But their original -- in fact, I don't know of an original program that they have that's in that category. And so a lot of the rerun stuff is available on other avenues, even the NBA's going to be -- a majority of it on ESPN and the NBA network. So -- and even things like the Final 4 stuff are on the Internet now. So that's what I mean. When you start having your product being available from a lot of different sources, customers don't want to pay for it twice. And sometimes, they're willing to watch it the next day or the next week in a more convenient structure because young people aren't -- they are not watching stuff live now, so -- except ESPN. So it's -- here's the way I'd look at it. Mathematically, we're probably not going to be able to carry all the 10 major people long term and -- because we just don't want to raise prices to $100 a month, right? And so when you do that, somebody is going to drop off. We don't want any of our programming partners to drop off, but they'll self-select. And somebody's going to drop off and we'll keep our prices lower. And we'll lose some subscribers, but we'll net-net be cash flow-positive on it, which is how we look at it. I hope it's not Turner because Turner was the very first company who signed with us in DVS. So that's like the last -- it's one of the easier ones to take down in my opinion, but it's like the last one I personally want to take down because they're the guys that helped us get in business. And I'm a pretty loyal guy, right? I would bend over backwards for Turner because they helped us get in business, right? But we're not -- we have a responsibility to our shareholders not to do stupid deals. And it's hard when people's view -- we realize we have real viewership, right? So we know how many minutes people watch CNN, and we know how many minutes they watched CNN 5 years ago. And it's hard when somebody wants a price increase, double-digit price increase for something that people are watching half as much as they used to watch. That just doesn't make sense. And it's not -- it's Turner's job to make their product better, not ours. Ours is to make their product more convenient for the consumer at a fair price, but they've got to make their product better. And when they make their product better, they get more money for it. And if your products not as good as, you can't expect to get big increases because that model doesn't work. And I don't want to really pick on Turner. I think everybody's got that same issue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lee Cooperman from Omega Advisors.","Leon G. Cooperman - Omega Advisors, Inc.","Just for the record, Charlie, I'd say that I wish I had more guys that I could invest in with like you, so I'm fully prepared to put my clients' money and my money in your hands. My question relies around tax efficiency. We have no idea how spectrum will ultimately be used by DISH, or whether you sell some, keep it all, whatever. But have you thought about putting spectrum into a separate vehicle, where if a transaction occurred, that it would be much more tax-efficient for the -- for DISH?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. That's as far as I can go. I'm looking at the attorneys, they're giving me the ax, but the answer is yes.","Leon G. Cooperman - Omega Advisors, Inc.","Okay. Well, good. I assume that you did and you are, and again, I'm more than happy to let you figure it out and do all the heavy-lifting.","Thomas A. Cullen","Yes, Lee, this is Tom. I guess I would just say, we believe OTT spectrum and the core DISH business belong together at this point. But of course, we evaluate various structures that we could entertain, depending on how the market breaks.","Leon G. Cooperman - Omega Advisors, Inc.","Well, I may be off my rocker, but I think the spectrum you have could be worth as much as the entire market value of the company presently.","Charles W. Ergen","We can't comment on that one. I know I can't comment on that one. But I think we did spend -- I do think that if you go back to our last conference call, which was, what, August -- what month are we in now -- August or whenever that was, I think we articulated where we think things go.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm not going to turn this into a Time Warner call, but I wonder if you have any thoughts on HBO's plan to go over-the-top and how as a distributor of that product -- and it's a different product than the basic cable network, given that you participate in the revenue, how you feel about that move? And what DISH's response, if anything, might be there? And then on the PSS over-the-top service, Charlie or Joe, do you have a return target in mind? Or maybe even qualitatively, can this be as good of an IRR business as the DISH TV business? Because when we look at the gross margin at an attractive price point for the millennial, it's sort of hard to see a lot of gross profit dollars in the OTT space. If you look at Netflix, their churn is probably double your's monthly, and they don't make a lot of money on a gross margin basis. So at least today, how are you thinking about the return profile of that asset?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, when you -- this is Charlie. When you look at total return, we'd look at it and would anticipate that it would be as good or better than our core business. You're right, the margin will be less. I think that's true. The churn will be higher. I think that's true. The counterbalance from that is that there -- you're not going to have $800 a SAC. In fact, your SAC will be very low to get a customer. And your -- most of what will be done there will be on the Internet, so your actual variable cost per month to service a customer is much less. So you've got a kind of a different financial model, where your ARPU margins are a little bit less but your SAC is materially less. When you run all the numbers, to the extent that you're getting incremental subs, it makes sense. Second part of it is that the advertising opportunity, I think, is immense in OTT, not in 2015, but as you go forward, because we can just -- we can stream a personalized ad to everybody. So -- and working -- again, working with the programming partners and working with the data that's available and working with the event that we can send everybody on this call a different ad when they're watching means that we can start moving into some of the categories that the Facebooks and the Googles of the world are taking advantage of today. And so I think that's another dynamic. I think the advertising piece of OTT is materially higher than it is in linear TV, where with the advent of DVRs, we've said from day 1, people do skip commercials. And so rather than fight -- rather than swim upstream with that, we'd rather come up with a different dynamic that attacks it in a different way.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Any comment on HBO?","Charles W. Ergen","Oh, yes, HBO. I mean, Joe may want to pipe in here. But the -- I mean, I think everybody's searching for how they can monetize their content. And I certainly don't blame HBO for taking a look at that. As far as -- we have to wait and see what their -- obviously, what their plans ultimately will be, and when they're going to do it. And again, we're -- the way we would look at that is if they're just going to compete with us, then that's probably not that attractive to us. If they want to work -- we want to work with all those people who want to work with us. And if they want to work with us, we think we add a positive to that dynamic because it's not just about putting your -- it's not all about just putting your product out there, there's a lot of things that go into it. So we think we can be value-added as they move forward, but I'm sure we'll have those discussions and I'm sure they'll go whatever route they think is best for their company. And we hope that DISH and our industry is involved in it because I think that's -- I personally think that's the best way to do it. But I think people will go different directions and go do different things and some will work and some won't. I mean, Starz went a different direction with Netflix way back when. I think it hurt them in the long run. Wrestling has gone a different direction. I think it's hurt them in the short run, I don't know if it hurts them in the long run. But I also know that management has to do what they think is right for their shareholders and their company. And that -- I'm sure that they're well managed. And so I'm sure that Time Warner will make some good -- will make good decisions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","My first question is on broadband churn. I think you alluded to capacity constraints. I wasn't sure if that was also a factor in expanded churn. If you can provide some color as to where the customers are churning to? And if the changes -- if the new satellite launches that you mentioned earlier would also be expected to reverse the churn, that would be helpful. And I have a follow-up question.","Joseph P. Clayton","Okay. This is Joe. I'll try to handle that. I'd have to say when we first started with the launch of dishNET broadband about 15, 16 months ago, we probably didn't do the best job of qualifying our consumer base. For example, if you're passed by fiber right in front of your home or cable, this is probably not going to be the best product for you. It is much more attuned to rural America, where there is slow-speed Internet or no Internet capability at all. So I think we contributed somewhat to the churn ourselves by taking on some customers who indeed had better alternatives available to them. We have since started tightening that requirement in qualifying a person when they call up to our call center. And then also, in terms of being a little more operationally efficient in terms of the install on the locations of where the customer base is at. Those productivity improvements have been in place, and it has contributed to our churn, higher than we would have expected. But indeed, it is starting to come down with the initiatives that we put in place. And we expect to be lower by this time next year. And when the new high-powered satellites are up in about a year, as Charlie said, it will free up a lot of the capacity constraints, which is also holding back our sales growth. So I think it's a combination of 2 things: capacity constraints and churn. Actually, some of it precipitated by our not qualifying the consumer properly at the outset. I hope that helps.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Okay. That's helpful. Just on that second point, just to be clear. Are you suggesting that there might have been some quality-of-service issues when you talk about customers that had better alternatives, that you didn't prequalify the right way?","Joseph P. Clayton","Well, if somebody -- if a customer is going to be -- get 250 gigabits and all we can offer him is 20 or 30, and he's going to be a streamer, he's going to download a lot of HDTV movies, he's going to be a gamer, he's going to have better alternatives than what we offer.","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. It's a -- selling broadband is a more limited product. It's a product that probably is the best thing for maybe 5 or 10 million homes out there. It's not the best product for 100 million homes out there, right? And so we have to do maybe a bit better job of explaining that to consumers on the front end. They're happy with the speeds. What they're not happy with is the amount of capacity, where they may only get -- if they only get 20 gigs or 40 gigs of product, there are customers who use more than that. There's plenty of customers who use just 1 or 2 gigs, right? So -- particularly in rural America. But there's people who use more, and we have to do a better job of -- that would be the #1 complaint, which is I love the product, except I don't -- I ran out of capacity on the sixth day of the month, right? And that shouldn't be a surprise to people. We can do a better job up front with that. So the new satellites will help. The second thing is -- just so you know where it goes strategically, Tom may want to talk about this. But the other piece of it, to the extent that we can do fixed broadband -- and again, we don't have a major initiative out there other than the test that we have today. But to the extent we can do fixed broadband, those customers who want increased data, that's a really good place for them to go, right? And that also fits kind of in small-town America, where there's not -- where the -- where they don't -- where they're not getting super high-speed fiber broadband today. And that's a pretty efficient place to go. When you put fixed broadband with satellite -- fixed terrestrial broadband with satellite broadband, the same marketing is done for both of them and you can give the -- you can rightsize the customer, put in those products. I don't know, Tom, do you want to...","Thomas A. Cullen","Yes, again, cautious about the auction, so I'm somewhat limited in what I can talk about regarding the wireless trials. But I was -- as I think most of you know, we have a trial going on with both nTelos and Sprint. I was out in customer homes about 10 days ago, meeting with people that have had the product now for a few months. And they're very pleased with it. They're pleased with the speed. They're pleased with the service and the choice. So the experience is good. We're optimistic about the efforts, and we're still learning. As I've said on previous calls, it will take us a while to load up the networks and pistol-whip the business models and understand the marketing and installation challenges. But those are things that we've seen and tackled before. At this point, we're not sharing numbers. But I will tell you that we're training more installers and we're sending more installation resources into both of those markets. We're seeing some positive attachment rates in terms of DISH bundling. And we're learning things. For instance, we know that the CPE can be improved, both from a cost standpoint and from a design standpoint, where we can make a smaller unit that will give us more installation options. So I guess at this point, I'd say we're encouraged by where we're at. The customers like it, and we have a very good relationship with both partners.","Charles W. Ergen","And hopefully, we'll get -- since Steve is -- since this is Steve's first rodeo as the CFO, hope I get a financial question because I'd like to see if he can answer the question. A lot of things we do here is train people, right?","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Okay. Just a quick follow-up, Charlie. I think you said that your OTT offering is going to skew a little bit of sports, when you were kind of mentioning or talking about that in the earlier question. And given the environment of the sports program in the context of some of the recent deals that were signed recently, I was wondering if you could comment generally on the sports offering and your strategy there. I think you've -- in the past, you've kind of passed on a lot of the deals. So I'm wondering if -- how you see the current environment for sports and how that kind of might play to your strategy there, especially on the OTT side.","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I think for sports, where sports is reasonably priced, we're going to carry it. And realize that that's a relative term, reasonably priced, because sports is an expensive product for the content writers to pay for, right? So everything in sports is going up. But because we have real viewership measurement, right, we have a feel for what sports is worth for our customers, right? And that may not always coincide with what somebody paid for the rights. And if somebody pays too much for the rights and then comes in and says, \"We got to cover our rights fees,\" -- so the Dodgers is a good example, right? There is no way the Dodgers are worth more than the Yankees. Next question, right? I mean, there's no way. So if somebody comes in and says, \"We want more of the Yankee prices,\" for a product that less people watch, nobody in this call would do that deal, right? And the only way you do that deal is if you own the team, right? So I just think we have a -- we have to make hard choices with real economics and math and real data that says this is about the value of what that is. And we're not -- if we lose some subs next quarter because we don't carry a product, but it's the right thing to do and increases our earnings and our cash flow, right, that's a decision we're going to make. We're not going to -- it's not like Joe is not going to get a bonus if he does the right thing on subs, right? That's not the way we operate. So we're advantaged in that. And so I -- look, I think Disney is the most important person -- company in sports, right? And I think that you start with that. And then I think there's other people around Disney that are important. But if Disney wants a sports product, if they want the Olympics in -- they can afford to pay. If they want the NFL on Thursday nights and Saturdays and Sundays, they can afford to do it. So they get first choice at everything and then -- because they have the highest right -- they have the revenue from distribution, they are fully distributed. So you start with Disney and then you work -- you fill that in with whatever your strategy is.","Joseph P. Clayton","All right, operator. We have time for one more question from the Wall Street community.","Charles W. Ergen","And, hopefully, it's a financial question.","Joseph P. Clayton","And then we'll move on to the press.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan from Telsey Advisory Group.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Last month, a federal judge ruled in favor of DISH in the AutoHop service case versus Fox. If you could just share with us what's next here? Like how does that help DISH negotiate with CBS? And how does that help you guys negotiate with programmers regarding the OTT service?","Charles W. Ergen","I think it's pretty -- I mean, I think it's pretty irrelevant. I mean, it's -- I think there was a lot of emotion about that product when it came out. But people realize that people skip commercials, they skip on our service, they skip equally on everybody else's service. I don't think that's -- I just don't think that's -- I think there was a lot of emotion around that when it came out. But I think it's -- the practical effect of that has been overestimated, I guess. I don't -- right? I mean, at this point, look, we're going to fight for consumers. And if we don't fight for consumers, nobody else will. And we're probably one of the few people in this industry who fight for consumers, whether it be spending 3 years in Congress to get local-to-local, when everybody was against us, or whether it be for the right of consumers to watch TV in a good manner or watch multiple shows or watch shows on a tablet or skip commercials. I mean, we're going to fight for those things. But we're also cognizant that we are in a dual-revenue-stream model. And if advertising revenue is severely hampered, they got to raise their rates somewhere else. And so what we've argued since day 1 is we're not against the advertising model, but the model that we're doing today doesn't work and it's painful for consumers and so they skip commercials. Why don't we do a different model, where the consumer actually gets a targeted ad that's more meaningful to them, that you actually make money on and they actually watch. That seems like a better model, and that's what we worked with the content people who want to work with us, right? We're showing -- we have technology that does that. And we're working with them, with very, very good results. And so I think that's a better mousetrap. And we might not have done it exactly the right way, but I think we're on the right path as it comes to a good advertising model with our partners.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","And then I have a quick follow-up. Next in early to mid '15, where the Comcast and deals with DIRECT are potentially closing, there should be a huge amount of systems [ph] that are going to be transferred between operators. So wondering, is this going to be fertile ground for DISH to be able to poach customers? And so if you could just give us some sense of how DISH is going to be positioning itself for that?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I think the mergers are always an opportunity for -- it's obviously distractions for companies, right? So I think in that sense we should be advantaged. And I think there's also an advantage. If I'm a programmer, I'm scared to death of those 2 mergers and you -- because the dynamic changes, right? The dynamic changes from the programmer coming in saying, \"We want a double-digit rate increase,\" to those really big guys coming in saying, \"We want a double-digit price decrease,\" because you can't afford 30 million people going down and you can't afford -- if you're a network, you can't afford 60% of your customers going down in Philadelphia, right? And so the dynamic will be much, much, much different. And so in that sense, forward-thinking content people are going to make sure that DISH is successful, right? They're certainly going to want to work with us, I would think, right? Because if you don't want to work with us, God forbid, I know -- it's just human nature, if you have 30 million subscribers, you're 1\/3 of the business, your hammer is a little bigger than if you got 15% of the business. I mean, it's some kind of inverse relationship, but I'd assume your hammer's about 8x bigger. It's probably what the math works out to. So I think the dynamic is interesting, and hopefully, we can take advantage of things. All right. I think that was the last one, even though we didn't get a financial question. And maybe the press will ask you a financial question, Steve.","Joseph P. Clayton","Operator, if the press is not queued, we could do one more. Where do you stand? Operator?","Operator","We will now take questions from the members of the media. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Liana Baker from Reuters.","Liana Baker","I was wondering if someone could talk about how EchoStar and the technology coming out of that side of the business and that company helps the wireless vision or efforts at DISH.","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. I mean, that's a very good question for their conference call later in the week. But essentially, EchoStar as a company has tremendous engineering capabilities, right? And those engineering capabilities -- they virtually have invented every communication with the satellite, so all the protocol to go up to satellites and the modulation schemes to go to satellites is an EchoStar product. Those same modulation schemes and technology are very similar to what you do terrestrially. So there's good expertise there. Certainly, RF experience is necessary, so there's good expertise there. Certainly, there's things like intellectual property that's important, where they certainly hold a number of -- hundreds of patents and so forth. So -- and they also are world-class when it comes to digital design. So I think that -- I think they have a -- regardless of DISH, they have a bright future in the wireless business. And certainly, things like OTT is -- I mean, you can probably talk about OTT better than I can, Joe.","Joseph P. Clayton","Well, you asked a wireless question, Liana. But in terms of the OTT business, which we're getting ready to launch, Charlie said it earlier that it is a complex business. It's the streaming and the ad insertion capability. EchoStar bought a company called Move Networks about 4 years ago, which I'll call, has the secret sauce that provides a smooth Internet streaming capability for customers. And it's called adaptive bit rate technology. Of course, they have patents and intellectual property capabilities that came with that. That will help us have a first-mover advantage from a technological standpoint when we launch our new service here shortly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shalini Ramachandran from Wall Street Journal.","Shalini Ramachandran","So I just want to make sure crystal clear, is your -- how much did HBO's recent streaming announcement factor into why you guys decided to drop the Turner networks, if at all?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, this is Charlie, 0. None. I mean, it was -- in fairness to Turner, we've got a new team since Steve is -- was Head of Programming, he's now the CFO. So we have limited resources here. And Turner, themselves, has a new team, right, in terms of executive management and so forth. So you end up with a different set of dynamics than you might have in a normal negotiation. But HBO announcement really has -- I think they run those 2 companies separately. And we look at them -- our customers look at them separately. They're apples and oranges for our customers. And so that's -- if our customers look at it in apples and oranges, that's how we look at it.","Shalini Ramachandran","Okay. And one more thing, if it's an answerable question, about LightSquared. I just want to make -- understand, is it possible for DISH to use the spectrum, whatever spectrum you acquire personally, through LightSquared in any way?","Thomas A. Cullen","Hey, Shalini, it's Tom. Same answer as earlier. It's not appropriate to talk about LightSquared in this forum, and we're not -- and we're very limited in what we can say about spectrum, period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Sherman from Bloomberg.","Alex Sherman","2 questions, first one is really quick. In terms of an OTT price point, are you guys still thinking about $30 a month?","Charles W. Ergen","Alex, this is Charlie. We haven't decided yet, but that sounds in the ballpark. I mean, I think it's something around -- I think that something along $1 a day is kind of what the marketplace -- so that limits how many channels you can put in, obviously, when you got some sports channels in there that are pretty expensive.","Alex Sherman","Okay, good. Second question, Charlie, talk about the M&A landscape around you as you see it going into 2015. You sort of alluded to it in the last analyst question there. But if Comcast-Time Warner cable goes through, and AT&T and DIRECTV, do you expect more programming consolidation over the next 6 to 9 months? Or do you see more international competition coming into the U.S. in either wireless or content?","Charles W. Ergen","Every strategy, there's a counterstrategy. So I think that as M&A -- I think -- those 2 big transactions that are in front of the government today, depending on what happens with those, will drive other things. And I don't know whether those mergers will be approved or not. I would say that Comcast-Time Warner has -- is more problematic for consumers for sure. I've never seen as many consumer -- not complaints but consumer...","Thomas A. Cullen","Opposition.","Charles W. Ergen","Opposition to that. And it's control of the broadband business in the United States, so that one's got definitely more issues. But that would drive other things, right? And certainly, even AT&T and DIRECTV will drive other things. We probably won't -- Alex, we probably won't be able to participate since no banker wants to work with us.","Alex Sherman","Well, thanks for reading, Charlie. I appreciate that. I think you guys will find your way.","Charles W. Ergen","Well, that was a great article, but next time, Alex, talk -- if you really want a good article, talk to our bankers because our bankers will talk on the record. They don't gossip. They will talk on the record. Bob's here. And you didn't -- so he's going to be pissed at me for saying anything to you. But you've always written good articles, Alex. And I was disappointed that you'd spend more time gossiping and less time taking quotes from our bankers.","Alex Sherman","Well, not all your bankers will speak on the record.","Charles W. Ergen","The ones I gave you will. Anyway, it's not -- you've always written good articles, Alex. I've always appreciated what you write. And I do read what you write.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Farrell from Multichannel.","Mike Farrell","I just had another question about OTT. Charlie, I mean, earlier, I think on the analyst call, you kind of mentioned that you envision kind of a landscape where not everybody will have the same kind of group of networks. Do you kind of foresee a future with all these other guys, and yourself included, kind of specializing in different niches, I mean, where DISH could be like the entertainment OTT company or somebody else could be the sports entertainment OTT company?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I'd say a couple of things. One is DISH wants to work with those people who want to work with us, right? And we'd have a feel for what the value is of things. So maybe there could be honest disagreements where somebody thinks something is more valuable than we would -- while we might both want to participate, that just -- the business deal can't be done. There'd be some cases where people want to go direct or don't want to participate with DISH and then there's people who do want to participate with us. And we think we bring a lot to the party in terms of the technology and the -- all the things that we've worked on to put in place. And so I think that's one way that's going to happen. And so I think you'll see different strategies for the content provider. And sometimes the content provider will sell it to a third-party who will put it in an OTT package, right? So you -- that's what happens with Netflix, right? Somebody sells movies to them and they put it in a package. So I think you'll see varying degrees of content strategies. And again, we don't have all the answers. We're just trying some things based on our judgment that will work. As far -- we've already seen Suddenlink -- I think we've seen instances of Suddenlink as -- that looks to me like as -- I don't want to put words in Suddenlink's mouth, but it looks to me like they may have permanently dropped Viacom from their networks that -- and certainly, there's been talk of DIRECTV and AMC in a contract dispute. Obviously, we're missing CNN today on our network. So you're just starting to see those rumblings, right? And I think that if you can go get content -- if you can go get news somewhere else, it -- 20 years ago, CNN was a must-have. It's not a must -- it's not a top 10 network today anymore, right? Unless they find the plane, the Malaysian plane. So you just have to see how those dynamics change. And I'm a -- I like working with people I like to work with. I like working with people and companies who want to try to go the same direction that we want to go, right? And it's not very much fun at my age to work with people who just want to have a contract and follow you around with their contract all the time. So I like -- we're still trying to invent stuff and make products better and still trying to use technology and be in the 21st century. And those people who want to be there, I hope we have good relationships with.","Mike Farrell","Just a quick follow-up. Are you seeing in any -- I know you can't talk about specific negotiations, but are you seeing programmers in general being a little more open to unlocking the bundle for OTT?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes.","Mike Farrell","Or are they digging their heels in saying, \"We got 20 networks, you're going to pay for 20 networks?\"","Charles W. Ergen","They all have different strategies. But in answer to your question, in general, there's -- most programmers are pretty open to trying some new things, right?","Mike Farrell","Could that translate to your satellite business?","Charles W. Ergen","It could. I mean, it -- look, I think business is -- business ultimately is about -- I think you have to innovate and try things to move forward as a company, right? And we're in a mature -- the regular linear MVPD business is a mature business, right? So you can't just go back every day and say, \"I'm going to raise my rates and make my budget.\" That's -- you're going to have to figure out other ways -- other revenue streams and other -- and get other people to pay for your product and watch more minutes of your product. And this is -- I'm going to get off the subject here, but the minutes that people watch cable television and the networks today this year is less than the minutes last year and less than the year before and less than the year before that, right? And it's a little bit because people cut the cord, but it's a lot because people are watching Netflix or YouTube or Amazon with the available minutes in their life, right? And if you have 5 hours a day that you can watch TV and you watch Netflix for 45 minutes of that, then you're only watching 4 hours and 15 minutes of TV. And that's what -- that's happening, right? And so the landscape of what you can do in the mature business is different. So you got to think about it differently, right? And some companies are -- I mean, it's no -- I don't think there's any -- it wasn't a coincidence that Disney went first in OTT. They're just more creative there, right? They're willing to try -- they're not scared of technology, and so they're trying some different things. I thought that -- again, I said I thought the announcement today was brilliant on the movies between Apple and Android. Just -- it's just brilliant, right? Whereas everybody else just fights for -- and doesn't take in consideration the consumer. So I -- there's just -- it's a pleasure to work with companies who want to try some things.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Stanley from The Financial Times.","Aaron Stanley","Just in the spirit of Election Day, I wanted to touch base quick on how addressable advertising revenues have sort of fared into this -- the past 2 months of this third quarter. Obviously, this is one of the new trends in political advertising. And I just wanted to see how big of an impact this has had? What type of success has there been, especially since 2012? And where do you see this going over the next 2 years?","Joseph P. Clayton","This is Joe Clayton. I'll try to take that and any of the rest of the guys can jump in. Our ad sales business, our media sales business, has got a great boost this year from our political advertising, if you will, with the interactive ads to the point that here in Colorado, we can't even take anymore advertising. It's already saturated to 100%. This is -- will be a growth initiative for us going forward, not just in the political season but in tailoring ads to the proper consumer base. But this will help our numbers significantly in the fourth quarter this year.","Charles W. Ergen","By the way -- this is Charlie, just to add to that. It's not a hugely material kind of number, the political advertising. We realize we're doing that in conjunction with DIRECTV as well. So it's the satellite industry. But what it does do is prove conceptually that you can do targeting ads that will generate a lot more income. And that's -- that should be good for our programming partners and that should be good for us going forward because we've got real, live case study of materially more advertising dollars in the political arena this year than -- by a large factor, and I don't know what the exact numbers are, but it's -- we probably don't disclose it but...","Thomas A. Cullen","We don't, right.","Charles W. Ergen","Many x numbers higher.","Thomas A. Cullen","That's right.","Charles W. Ergen","Okay, operator, we have time for one more from the media.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Moritz from Bloomberg.","Scott Moritz","On mobile video, Charlie, you -- during the Sprint bid, you outlined sort of your goals for what the future of mobile video would look like. I'm wondering now that Sprint is not available, and maybe that's a good thing, if you still see things the same way? And do you still have some options to maybe bring that sort of service to the market?","Charles W. Ergen","Can I answer that?","R. Stanton Dodge","Yes.","Charles W. Ergen","I mean, we still -- I don't think we see things differently, I guess, is what I'd say. But I'd probably give a lot more detail if I didn't -- if we didn't have the Anti-Collusion rules in place. But I think I'll just leave it at that. So that's -- so thanks, everybody.","R.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jason Kiser. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Kiser - DISH Network Corp.","Thanks, Isaac. Well, thanks for joining us. This is Jason Kiser, Treasurer here at DISH Network. Joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman and CEO; Tom Cullen, EVP of Corporate Development; Roger Lynch, CEO of Sling TV; Erik Carlson, President of DISH Network; Steve Swain, our CFO; Paul Orban, our Controller; and Stan Dodge, our General Counsel.","We're going to open it up for Q&A, but we do need to do our Safe Harbor disclosures. So for that, we'll turn it over to Stan.","R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp.","Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in your reports. We also do not allow audio-taping and ask that you respect that.","All statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from historical results and from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a list of those factors, please refer to the front of our 10-K.","All cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as being applicable to any forward-looking statements that we make wherever they appear. You should carefully consider the risks described in our reports and should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements which we assume no responsibility for updating.","And with that out of the way, I'm going to turn it over to our CFO, Steve Swain.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Thanks, Stan. During the first quarter, DISH completed a transaction with EchoStar which was (01:30). EchoStar transferred to us certain assets and operations of the EchoStar technologies and EchoStar broadcasting businesses. These businesses and their associated IP design, develop and distribute set-top boxes, provide satellite uplinking services and develop streaming video technologies.","In addition, we received investments in high frequency spectrum bonuses, joint ventures such as NagraStar (01:57), certain real estate, as well as the remaining 10% interest in Sling TV. In exchange, we transferred to EchoStar our tracking stock, representing an 80% economic interest in the Hughes residential retail satellite broadband business. We believe that this transaction will give DISH more direct control over the product development of our Pay-TV business, which includes Sling TV and it is projected to be modestly accretive to free cash flow due to the elimination of EchoStar's profit margin as well as other efficiency initiatives.","Because the transaction was between entities that are under common control, accounting rules require us to recast our numbers as of the earliest period presented to include the impact of this transaction. The impact of recasting the first quarter of 2016 increased our equipment revenue by $40 million primarily due to international set-top box sales to third-parties. Our next income increased by $10.6 million primarily due to the margin on those international equipment sales and the elimination of the margin on the transferred products and services we previously purchased from EchoStar. To build your financial models, the 2016 recasted income statements by quarter are presented in the MD&A section of our 10-Q.","Regarding the balance sheet, the transferred assets were recorded at net book value and the tracking stock was removed with the difference booked (03:32) capital. Also similar to the P&L, we adjusted PP&E and inventory to remove the set-top box and accessories margin which we had previously paid to EchoStar.","Separately, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement which Hughes, which allows us to market and install the Hughes broadband service. Hughes will make certain payments to us for each sale and installation. Please note, subscribers acquired under this agreement will be Hughes branded retail subscribers and therefore, will not be included in our broadband subscriber count. As a result, our broadband subscriber count related to the Hughes service will decline through customer attrition.","More broadly, with only wholesale economics, we believe this is the right time for us economically and for our Pay-TV customers to pivot away from the wholesale model. A model in which we pay acquisition costs but has significantly lower margins relative to our competitors. For additional information, please see our 10-Q that was filed this morning.","With that, Isaac, we will now open up the call for, first, analyst Q&A and then media Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Perfect. Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks. Two, if I can. Charlie, can you talk about your spectrum strategy going into the auction and how you ended up? How does having the 600 megahertz spectrum change the value of the overall portfolio? And then second for Steve. Can you quantify for us the litigation impact from the first quarter that impacted G&A? Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Okay. Phil, it's Charlie. I'll take the first part. You never know what an auction is going to do. So \u2013 but our strategy going in, first, we thought it would go for materially higher than it did. But our strategy was to get one nationwide block of low-band spectrum because it does so many other things for our spectrum portfolio. Obviously, 600 low-band propagates farther. So in terms of penetration through walls and basements and things for your signal, that was an important part of where we were trying to go. Second, when you start looking at the Internet of Things and all the devices you're going be connecting in the future, low-band is ideal for Internet of Things and that technology is going to change quite a bit with 5G and so there's a focus there.","We were pleasantly surprised that as the auction went on, it became clear at the end of the \u2013 the first round or the second round that the price was not going up; that it was going stay sub-$20 billion based on our projections. And we felt that was probably in excess of $0.50 on the dollar in terms of real value for the spectrum. So we were then able to not only get our nationwide spectrum but also then to stay in the bigger cities where we felt that the \u2013 particularly the Internet of Things would be beneficial.","So one of the things about auctions today is that the way the FCC does it it's based on population. So everything \u2013 every analyst and everything, I always quote megahertz per pop. But the last several auctions, we've kind of looked at where we think things are going and we look at it on megahertz per thing, not megahertz per pop or megahertz per microprocessor. So whether it'd be streetlights or heart monitors or automobiles or drones or whatever, we've always looked at it as a megahertz per thing. And when you do that, obviously the more densely populated cities are quite a bit of a bargain discount, if you believe our theory is right on that. So that was the strategy. We were pleasantly surprised. Pleased to be one of two companies that got nationwide blocks in the auction. So, Steve?","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Yes. Phil, so unfortunately, I can't quantify the litigation impact because these settlements were confidential. I can say that even without the litigation impacts, we would have been down year-over-year on the G&A line.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Steve.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Sure.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Walter Piecyk with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Charlie, when the FCC made the decision on the designated entity bidding credits, I think you had mentioned something like they obviously don't want us to be a competitor and maybe look to sell it and I think at the time, you might have even talked about, Jason breaking up or looking at ways to have those assets in different buckets. Now that you've come away with this 600 megahertz band, I mean, it's a more complete package, has your view on that changed? And should we rule out the possibility of you selling any of this stuff in pieces and this is more kind of a do something with it in its entirety or \u2013 and only if someone's willing to pay for it in its entirety, would you actually willing to sell it? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I guess on the AWS-3 auction where we obviously participated with two designated entities, I think at least we were \u2013 at least myself personally, beyond depressed when the FCC ruled that they would disallow the discounts, because I knew that we had followed the rules and the precedent that \u2013 and every other company had taken \u2013 all of our competitors taken advantage of the discounts in such a massive auction. But obviously, the number was quite big but, on a relative basis, it really wasn't just anything historical, and it's no different.","And then at the same time, you have an auction of airways for broadcasters where the government gave them spectrum for free and they just walked away with $10 billion and not a word is said about the fact that broadcasters walked away with $10 billion of profits for something they got for free and we were buying spectrum. So, to me, I don't believe it was fair. And probably more disconcerting, we were never allowed to come into the FCC and to the extent they had issues with it to work through those issues with the FCC so that the outcome was fair.","So obviously that's in litigation today. That's in front of the courts. The courts will decide whether the FCC followed within jurisdiction or whether they didn't. And we'll live \u2013 who knows how long that will go on. But look we're going live with \u2013 you can always have honest disagreements. We have an honest disagreement with the past administration on that one. And we'll see what the courts come through.","Having said that, we aren't giving up and we didn't give up and we're not giving up. And so we're really pleased to strengthen our spectrum position and our strategic position and we're not going to rule anything out and we're not going to rule anything in.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Okay. So even though it's a more complete package now, you don't rule out \u2013 in certain situations, if someone wanted to buy a piece of the package that you would consider that as well?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I mean, I think that there are \u2013 look, I think there's interesting parts in this auction. I think it's \u2013 I don't want to speak for AT&T, but it's pretty clear that they didn't bid \u2013 I don't believe they placed a bid of any consequence after the first round. And obviously with their \u2013 excuse me, first stage. And obviously, with their selection in the FirstNet sweepstakes, that may be a lower priority to them. So there's people perhaps that are in this auction that have other strategic interest and there's certainly things that could happen where you can see, just like in football, somebody's got a good tight end and somebody needs a defensive back and you can see things happening with any number of companies. But you got to have a portfolio to play there.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Okay. Understood. And I think Rich wants to try and pin you down on a Sling number. Standby.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","So and, Charlie, last month comScore reported that Sling subs, if you include both domestic and international subscribers to at least one of your Sling packages, was something like 700,000 in July of 2016 and moved all the way up to 1.9 million by the end of 2016. Curious if that type of dramatic acceleration in Sling actually happened in the latter half of 2016 and what drove it. And just from a higher level, I guess, is it now conceivable that Sling, in some form, domestic, international, that that represents upwards of 15% of overall DISH video subscribers.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Hey, Rich. It's Roger. I'm going to field this one. Just on your second one, we don't break out Sling numbers separately, so can't answer that. Certainly, the second half of the year is a strong content time of year for us given all of the college and NFL football that occurs. So seasonally, we traditionally see stronger growth during the last four months of the year than we do in other periods of similar length throughout the year. So we can't comment on specific numbers but that is a seasonally strong period for us.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","And the other services that have launched haven't notably changed the trajectory of Sling, meaning competitors?","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","The other services that have launched have all really been big bundle OTT services, so largely replicating traditional Pay-TV packages. And so when I look at our portfolio with Sling Orange, which is at $20, the closest competitor really is about 75% higher price point, plus we have this ability to pick and choose the genres you want to add on, or our Sling Blue service, which, at $25, is quite attractive, has a lot of content in it. And obviously it doesn't have ESPN in it. We know a lot of people like ESPN but there are people who don't want to pay for ESPN. And so that gives us a cost advantage for that package compared to some of the other big bundles \u2013 for that service, sorry, compared to those other big bundles.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Charlie, could you talk about your view on the sort of timing of the 5G rollout in the United States and sort of your view on how the technology is progressing? And then secondly, the big carriers seem to be focusing on the millimeter wave portion of the spectrum, whereas you're focused more on the sort of low and mid band. One, do you think their focus on the very high frequencies is misplaced? And where do you think the bulk of the heavy lifting on 5G will take place? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. So I mean, there's \u2013 and there's a lot of misconception about 5G but I think I want to now \u2013 if you've ever watched Spinal Tap, I want to announce here first and foremost that we're going turn the volume up to 11 and we're going for \u2013 we're going to build out 11G and we're just going to go from 5G to 11G. And obviously, I'm being facetious that the 5G standard is not set yet so there's \u2013 you're not going to see true 5G until 2020 and probably 2021 in terms of 5G. And the main things that \u2013 5G is going to \u2013 it does a couple things, but one is much lower latency, which brings in things like autonomous vehicles, health care and things into a network that maybe won't work ideally on existing networks.","It certainly brings in Internet of Things in a way that with millions of devices it can connect at one time that you really can't do on existing infrastructure today. And of course, obviously it's more \u2013 it's going to bring 10, 20, 100 times more capacity in certain areas and adds things like millimeter wave technology. So it is a very transitional, it is a very big paradigm shift. And I think from a marketing people \u2013 marketing thing, people are going to want \u2013 jump the gun and call things 5G, but I don't think, you're \u2013 as an American consumer you're going to get anything truly 5G standard, just the total standard, until at least 2020.","As far as millimeter wave technology, I think it's very interesting technology. We have believed that for long time. We participated in the auction, the 28-gig auction. Gosh, it's been like 15 years ago, so we own four cities of 28-gig technology. But we also participated in MVDDS auction with 12-gig frequencies and that we have in most of the major cities in the United States and we're part of the MVDDS coalition that we believe that is the way for the government to add another 500 megahertz of spectrum that can be used for terrestrial use. We use that for satellite today. And we've worked with both the past and the current administrations to explain how that can help fund some of the spectrum gap out there.","So we're hopeful that \u2013 we just missed getting on the rulemaking for spectrum frontiers last time. We'll hope that the current administration will put that spectrum on public notice or in the rulemaking, so that people can comment. But that's certainly a place for the government to add another 500 megahertz of spectrum. And again, it's technically centimeter wave technology. It has better propagation technique \u2013 characteristics than 28-gig does and you can imagine a lot of uses in the spectrum deficit, how you could use that. So I think we're very well positioned, if higher frequencies find a home, we think we're well positioned there.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Two questions. So first, Charlie, just following up on the timing question. Can you talk about how some of the build-out requirements impact your decision on moving ahead with the spectrum build-out? And whether or not you feel that with a potential consolidation on the carrier side, namely T-Mobile and Sprint, if you feel like that leads you to any urgency to make a decision one way or the other? And then, Steve, can you talk about the ARPU impact from Sling TV and how we should think about the mix impact on total ARPU? Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Okay, Amy, on the build-out, one of the things I learned long ago is we focus on the things we can control. So while there's going be a lot of noise and there's certainly going to be talk of consolidation and lots of rumors about this company and that company doing something together, the one thing we can control is our build-out. And we have committed to the FCC that we will build out a narrow-band to IoT network to perfect our license by March of 2020.","Because of our spectrum position with the different bands we have, now with 600 megahertz in the mix as well, there are several different ways we could build that network out. Ideally, we'd like to build out 600 in the IoT network. But because of the 39-month clearing schedule, it's possible that to meet that deadline in March of 2020 that we can't necessarily use 600 in the way that we'd like to do it because that's a great frequency for that. So Tom and his team are now meeting with the vendors and we're also talking to the industry about what they want to see in an IoT network. And then we'll make some decisions later this year as to the frequencies that we're going to build out and then start the planning process and then start to build probably \u2013 we got to get \u2013 we have to get equipment and then start to build late next year and complete it by March of 2020.","So that's the one thing we can control. We feel like our balance sheet can support that build. We believe that that's what we control. In the meantime, I think obviously there's \u2013 in terms of the industry, I think there certainly will be a lot of discussions between people in the industry, potentially people outside the industry. Certainly, the potential of lighter regulatory in this administration could lead to some consolidation in ways that maybe weren't contemplated in the previous administration. And we have a tremendous set of assets at DISH. And it's our job as management to put those assets to work in the most economic long-term model that makes sense for our shareholders and for our customers. And that's what we'll do.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Yes, Amy. For ARPU, you're right. Sling TV subscribers on average purchase the lower-price programming compared to DBS. So therefore, as Sling TV subscribers increase, the weighted average Pay-TV ARPU will be lower. For DBS, we are seeing some subscribers shift to smaller, less expense packaging, commonly, as you know, known as cord shaving. Seeing that these customers want less robust packages, we did add Flex Pack, which is a skinny bundle option. And while the Flex Pack adds pressure to ARPU growth on the DBS side, we believe the function of Flex Pack as a churn-reducing save tactic increases margins in the instances where we had previously offered customers loyalty credits.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group","Great, thank you. Two questions. First, on the changing competitive dynamic in video, what we saw in the quarter or last quarter was DIRECTV didn't add subs for the first time in about six quarters due perhaps to higher churn because their subscribers are going to cable bundled with broadband and I guess over the top. So are you guys seeing anything incremental in terms of the competitive dynamic? And are you seeing Sling getting more subs from DIRECTV satellite? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. This is Charlie. I think your thesis is generally correct and I think we've been talking about that for at least five years, that that's kind of what we foresaw that the bundle \u2013 there's a lot of dynamics, but the bundle where programmers had a lot of leverage over the distribution path and you're forced to take not one or two channels or the top three rated channels from an event. But you may take 11, 12, 15 channels of which 10 of them maybe you don't really want, but you got to pass those costs onto consumers.","And the second dynamic is retransmission consent has gone up thousands of percent to the point where the cost of your local networks now exceed, for the most part, almost every channel but ESPN. And that dynamic is such that \u2013 and in all these cases, the ratings of the particular networks, for the most part, have gone down. And in the broadcasters' case, they've gone down significantly. So that's a dynamic that pushes people away from Pay-TV all together. And for those who stay in Pay-TV, they're going to go down to lower-cost alternatives. Less advertising, more binge viewing and the kind of things that have led to the rise of things like Netflix. So that's the dynamic that's out there. So one of the things that we've done is in recognizing those trends; obviously, we have pivoted the company to a connectivity company and have tried to invest in those things that we think have long-term returns and invest less in our traditional business.","So we're less likely to invest in a DBS subscriber in Boston, Massachusetts, where they've got good Internet connection from multiple sources who have an advantage in bundling both broadband and potentially OTT video. Roger then set on task \u2013 it's been almost six years now that Roger was set the course to come up with product that would be meaningful to consumers in that environment. So we think that we're well-positioned there. We think we're disciplined. We think that despite the fact that analysts and headlines are about sub loss or sub gain or this ARPU or that ARPU or this quarter or that quarter, we think we're very well-disciplined to take the \u2013 one of the few companies that can take a long-term view of it and say we're not afraid to change. We see the change happening and how do we take advantage of the change in a way that perhaps our competitors aren't doing or are slow to react or want to hold onto what they have but aren't really going to where the future is. And so it's difficult. There's course studies in MBA schools. There's a book written about it in terms of the entrepreneur's dilemma or whatever it's called, and we're living that every day. I forget the other part of the question. Was it -","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","...competitor impact.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, Roger, can you address it?","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, it's Roger. I'd say, well, one thing I've noticed is with the launch of these other OTT services, starting with DIRECTV NOW, they are bigger bundle packages. And so we're seeing Sling customers increasingly taking more add-on packs. So it may be a different class of customers coming into the market spurred by the big bundles that have launched in OTT. But we're definitely seeing customers who are taking more add-on packs that is certainly correlated with that.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, and this is Charlie. I think strategically when we started Sling, we were not looking to replace the cable bundle. We were not looking to take a cable subscriber or for that matter a satellite subscriber and suddenly convert them into an OTT because that was adding SAC to get the same customer. So that has not been our primary objective. Having said that, it appears that where Hulu and YouTube and DIRECTV NOW and Sony are, that they all are basically replicating the cable bundle. And so there's no question now that it's game on to convert a cable subscriber to an OTT subscriber for essentially the same services. So all those guys have, example, the Disney products with ESPN, which is, as you know, one of the most costly. And yet, studies show and we know from our own internal data that the vast majority of people do not actually watch ESPN particularly year-round. So you're ending up at \u2013 so that maybe there's a different strategy in there that works long term. If everybody's going north, maybe you should go northwest in life.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group","Well, looking -","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Maybe not. Maybe you should go north, but maybe you should go northwest. So my point is that I think the OTT model probably initially is going be a license to lose money for people as they price things below cost. Eventually, it'll sort its way out. And there'll probably be several different strategies within the OTT world. And Roger and his team are well-acquainted with potential avenues they could take.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group","Well, in that vein, Charlie, OTT services to me seem like they're frenemies, right? So they compete with each other but they also \u2013 if they get together, they can change the market and they can grow it, right? Do you see a tipping point that's going to be particularly notable as they cannibalize \u2013 they go from cannibalizing each other to taking more share away from Pay-TV?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, my belief is that OTT will take share away from Pay-TV. So satellite and cable will be smaller five years from now than they are today. And so satellite, you're already seeing that reduction, right, and satellite and phone companies, you've seen reductions really for the last couple of years. Cable, I think, with the strength of broadband has been able to kind of tread water and I think actually potentially gain some subs. And I think ultimately that will reverse too and that you will see a natural evolution to an OTT product because OTT in many ways can be a superior product. It can be less expensive and it can be superior. The question's going be what do those OTT bundles look like and how chopped up does the consumer get because he's going to have a lot more choice. And when he has more choice, he's going to go different directions. And meanwhile, obviously, Amazon and Netflix continue to grow.","So it's a very interesting dynamic. The one thing I know \u2013 the reason I sleep at night pretty well is that all those people have one thing in common. They need to be connected. They need connectivity for those customers to receive video. And we know, Roger knows that the vast majority of sessions for people who are taking OTT services are actually not on your TV screen but on mobile devices. So that means that you need wireless spectrum to connect, right? And so that's one point. Second point I'd make is you're in a regulatory environment where the current administration has said they're not in favor of \u2013 I don't want to put words in their mouth. But I think, correct me if I'm wrong, they're not really in favor of Title II. They're going to do a rule-making on net neutrality and that there's probably a lighter regulatory touch with that, which I would think to mean that the balance of power between distribution and content owners gets a little bit more level.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group","Super. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Charlie, based on your last comment, so are you sort of implying that if wireless net neutrality is reversed, then Silicon Valley edge providers may have more interest in controlling a distribution network in wireless? And second, on your comments on Sling, most of these media companies all tell us that they're sort of arbitraging indifferently by selling content to these new platforms and the economics are the same, if not better. But you've had the product for the longest time and you haven't seen any rate increase. I'm assuming your underlying programming costs are increasing. And sort of can you just talk more about the profitability and the sustainability of the OTT model? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Let me take the second part first. It's true that potentially OTT economics and what we traditionally see in linear could be relatively the same for an incremental customer, right, in part because your SAC is so much lower for your OTT product and you have the potential for an advertising model to be dramatically better, right? So that has to be all proven out, but the theory there I think still holds.","Having said that, you don't know what \u2013 when people have alternative motives, if you're selling video but you're also selling shipping services, you may subsidize one over the other. If you're selling wireless data plans and that's very profitable, you may subsidize something else. So I think there's going to be some dynamics in the industry where the models move all over the place. We'll just have to wait and see. But again, for us, we control what we control as we have to make a technically great product, a good user interface and make sure that within our programming contracts and the way that they're offered to the consumer is both unique and economical. And so that's kind of how we focus.","And then on your question about Silicon Valley, I do think that it's not really \u2013 let me answer broader. I do think that now that the quiet period's over and for the foreseeable future most of the spectrum is auctioned off in the United States with minor exception, that there \u2013 and with technology and the paradigm shift to 5G, that I think we'll see a couple of things. One is, I think, obviously, you could see consolidation within the wireless industry today with incumbents consolidating in some form or fashion. But I do believe that the cable industry has to take a good hard look at how they participate in this industry and potentially much more so than an MVNO deal. And I do think that one or more people from Silicon Valley will look at it more seriously, not just because of perhaps net neutrality regulations being weakened, but because their business depends on connectivity.","Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg did his 10-year plan. His first slide on his 10-year plan, it only has one word for 10 years and it's called connectivity. And so whether it be balloons or drones or connectivity or autonomous vehicles or healthcare, Silicon Valley is all over connectivity. And they're going to have to make sure that in a world of net neutrality, maybe Title II being eliminated; at least I would think they have to make sure that they're positioned so that they're not in a situation where their traffic, their connectivity is clogged. And then there's a third entrant that may come, which is less likely but still possible, is on the international side. I think that somebody ultimately is going to put together worldwide connectivity and worldwide \u2013 both on the satellite and a terrestrial basis. Obviously, the things like OneWeb on a satellite basis with low-earth satellites that could do worldwide connectivity and then you're going to do the same thing on the ground. So you're going to end up with possibilities there. So there's going to be a lot of movement. There's probably going to be a couple of phases of movement within the connectivity industry. And I'm pleased that we were able to participate in the 600-megahertz auction and strengthen our position in terms of where we can go and what we can do with connectivity.","By the way, just as a thought, there was nobody in the last two auctions that has risked more capital in the connectivity business than DISH along with our DEs. And in the auction that was \u2013 the third auction, the H Block auction, we're the only major participant in that. So we've been the most aggressive in that. History will prove it's a good strategy or bad strategy. But for the investors on the call, all your investments that you're making today, whether it be \u2013 that you're looking at in the future, whether it be autonomous vehicles or augmented reality or virtual reality or artificial intelligence or how do we get healthcare costs under control or how do you get productivity in industrial manufacturing or agriculture or what do municipalities do to make their cities safer and more productive, how you do education, how you do entertainment; not one of those potential investors can survive without connectivity in the future. Not one of them.","So one of the things that's interesting about where DISH is today is you can actually get a piece of all those investments by investing in one company because all those companies are going to have to use connectivity in their portfolio. They have to, right? That doesn't mean that there's not more money in the value-add on top of connectivity. Doesn't mean that sharing stuff with your friends about what you're watching or what you're cooking or whatever isn't more valuable because it might be. But you still have to be connected.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Two for Charlie and then one for Steve. Charlie, you talk about a network build. And I guess the question is are you planning to partner? Because the Wall Street perception is sort of that you have to and that it's unlikely to be Verizon or AT&T, that it could be someone like an Amazon or anyone else outside of the ecosystem. Second question would be, whether you would part with the DBS business separately from spectrum or should we think about those sort of married into one event if that was ever to happen? And then the question for Steve. Can you talk about trends in SAC longer term? So this was down 24% year-over-year. And if subscriber trends were to remain like this going forward, would the decline continue on this trend?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Okay, Marci. On the network build, our focus today is to build out our network to meet our 2020 deadline with or without partners. So we're prepared to do it within our balance sheet. And with \u2013 again, it's going be a new narrowband IoT network that doesn't exist today. So it's going to attack the market from a little bit different way, but it's certainly very much needed in terms of the United States. Obviously, I believe that there would be opportunity \u2013 I hope that there's opportunity the next three years where other people \u2013 for a lot of different potential partnerships.","For example, other people and that could be \u2013 it could be Verizon or AT&T or one of the other incumbents are where they're actually going to the tower to build out some of their spectrum. So for example, T-Mobile's going to go build 600 megahertz spectrum, maybe starting as early as later this year. There's opportunity there to say let's build that together. Let's build that at the same time and share the savings. AT&T and Verizon are going build their AWS-3 spectrum at some point. There's a chance to partner with those build-outs, even though you might be separate companies, in some cases you might be competitors. It still might make sense because both of you save money, so there's an opportunity.","There's tower companies that have to look long-term for new revenue sources that might want to partner in a certain sort of way. And then as you mentioned, there's people outside the industry who might want to protect their connectivity who might like these things. So I think there's any number of combinations there. But for the \u2013 right now, we're going to control what we can control and that's to go out and build a narrowband IoT network by 2020. And I can only go back to when we were build satellites.","I tried to get everybody in the world to build us a satellite. We were launching DBS and nobody would do it, so we got in the satellite business and built them ourself. And I think we're launching our 23 satellite this summer or something. So thank god nobody wanted to \u2013 I mean thank god nobody wanted to build them for us because it would've cost us a lot more money. But part of management is to figure out how you're going to do things and to be creative on how you're going to do things and to prove the skeptics wrong.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Does the 600 megahertz change the cost of the build-out?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","It does. It could \u2013 I guess it could. For example, I'm just a simple example, but we have some AWS-4 spectrum, its down-link only, in the 2.2 gig range. The limiting factor of your network is typically your uplink side. So now that we have 600 megahertz uplink nationwide, you could see with carrier aggregation that you could partner \u2013 you could put 600 megahertz with AWS-4 and your build-out costs could be materially less because you need less towers because you've solved some of your uplink propagation issues with 600 megahertz.","So I could make the case that the \u2013 that there's potential that much of the $6.2 billion of 600 megahertz spectrum actually could result in savings both on the build-out and the future operating cost on a net present value that could equate to a number pretty close to that. So I'm not confident enough to say that for sure today, but my sense is that there is probably a large savings in the build-out costs based on the 600 megahertz purchase.","The other question about separate DBS from \u2013 I've always felt that what we do at Sling and DBS and spectrum all go together. I think that our \u2013 I think with the 600 megahertz auction and the way that that really solidified the spectrum position we have that it is \u2013 it would be easier to separate some of our assets than it was before. But I still think they belong together. I mean obviously, one could now make the case that the \u2013 both the AT&T DBS and the DISH DBS could go together and there would obviously be tremendous synergy and savings in doing that.","And that because of all the OT \u2013 that because the competition \u2013 it wouldn't be going from 4 to 3, it would be going from 4 to 10 because of Sony and YouTube \u2013 Google and Hulu. Those are all real competitors to the DBS players today. So it's not a \u2013 it probably is not a regulatory issue today to put those companies together. And clearly, those companies together would be more value for both those companies than probably the market gives them credit for today.","What was the other question?","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","So, Marci, on SAC. On a per subscriber basis, the SAC has been relatively stable if you will, per addition on the underlying DBS ads as well as the Sling ads. It really depends on the mix associated with Sling relative to DBS. Just taking a step back and looking at the strategy. For DBS, we have been saying for several quarters now we are acquiring and retaining higher quality customers by refocusing on worldwide of these. We're more disciplined on credit and we're executing on several costs and revenue initiatives. And as we've already mentioned on the Sling side, we expect to see ARPU and margin expansion as it gains scale.","For instance, we haven't fully monetized our Sling addressable advertising revenue opportunity yet. And then lastly, I already mentioned this in my preamble but for dishNET, given the wholesale economics, we believe it's the right time for us economically, which impacts SAC, and for our Pay-TV customers to pivot away from the wholesale model. So you'll see less absolute dollars running through the P&L associated with the dishNET ads, as we pivot away from the wholesale model.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I had a question for Mr. Ergen. You talked about building a narrowband IoT network and also talked about looking at spectrum on the dollar per megahertz per thing basis as opposed to pop. I guess my question is this, do you really think in the next five years, there will be a business that is an IOT business, because maybe I'm too myopic, not forward thinking enough, but I sort of struggle with imagining a set of customers that could help your top line in the IoT space within five years. So if you could just elaborate on that a bit?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I guess I'd answer the question. IOT will be a huge business. And I wouldn't put the timeframe at five years. I think it will be evident to everyone within five years that it will be a huge business. Whether that will be just like the Internet was in the 1980s and people didn't realize that the Facebook and the Google were going to exist because of the \u2013 I think you're kind of in the same \u2013 I think it will go faster, but you're in the same situation where the possibility of Internet of Things is not going be \u2013 is going be underestimated long-term in terms of it just like the Internet was underestimated and the cloud has been underestimated. And now people are \u2013 the Fortune 500 companies of the future have been built from those businesses.","So I think my \u2013 I believe Internet of Things will be huge. Whether we're sitting here five years from now, saying, it's X or Year, probably won't be that relevant because it's ultimately going be a thousand X at some point. It's just hard to put a timeframe on it. But you do need 5G so you're talking about 2021, probably 2022, to make it really work the way you want it to work. So I think \u2013 you already kind of have Internet of Things. I mean in a funny sort of way Facebook is Internet of Things, it just connects people to their social life, right?","But when you can connect the city and your meters and your security and your lights and everything else, the city can be more efficient and the city can save money and so they're going to do it. And anything that's cheaper and better, you're going do, and the Internet of Things for sure is going to be cheaper and better. And I can think of a thousand things that need to get connected and there's probably another million things that we can't think of that other people will think of to be connected. And part of what we're looking at is our system to be open so that anybody who wants to participate in the network can invent things for the network.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Operator, I think we have time for one more before we go to the press.","Operator","Sounds great. Thank you. We'll take our final question from the analyst community. Our final analyst question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. Charlie, this is a question I think everybody has been trying to ask in lots of oblique ways, so let me just ask it a little more directly. How has your thinking evolved as to whether you would prefer to sell your spectrum, lease your spectrum, or lease the network, or just run it yourself? I guess as an outside observer, it would seem buying 600 megahertz spectrum is a lot more consistent with someone who actually wants to run a network than with someone who is looking to sell spectrum. Is that a reasonable interpretation of your participation in the auction?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I mean, I think one of the things you do when you start a business, you'd like that business to last more than 37 years, which is you'd like your business to last 100 years. So obviously we think pivoting to connectivity allows us to have a much longer runway for our company. But I think the way I would answer the question is, we're looking for whatever ultimately would enhance our shareholder value and our customers' and our employees' experience. And we think \u2013 at least today \u2013 we think that that is somebody who is looking at the wireless world in a disruptive manner that says the wireless connectivity in the United States is going to be different than four guys who you can make phone calls on and you can send a text and maybe you can stream a little bit of video, right, and you have an unlimited plan that's 22 gigs but they call it unlimited, so you have a limited unlimited plan. We think the world of wireless can be materially different than that.","It can be different because there's a paradigm shift in technology, the way you build your radio, the way you're going to propagate your network, whether it be inside out, maybe inside out instead of outside in, whether your core and how you do your network, the ability to slice your network in different slices, the ability to let other people share your network. All those things are possible in the 5G world. And for somebody who shares that vision of where things can go, we could get pretty excited about. If somebody says we're going to just do the same thing we're doing today, we're not that interested in that because we don't think that builds long-term shareholder value for our shareholders. So we try to look at where things are going instead of where they are.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you, Charlie.","Operator","We will now take questions from the members of the media. Our first media question comes from Scott Moritz with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Hey, thanks. Charlie, I guess I know it's only been four days, but have you folks received any kind of inquiries yet on deals? And are you surprised at all by the activity or lack of activity in that period? And also a second question. A lot of speculation around Sprint, T-Mobile, obviously. If that deal happens, would you feel like you needed to object to it, try to block it? Or would you feel there are still many other options available to you?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Scott, you've known us for a while. We don't \u2013 we won't \u2013 we're pretty private. I'm certainly a pretty private individual. So we're not going to comment in any way on discussions that take place, don't take place, rumors that are true, rumors that are not true, rumors that are outlandish, or whatever. We're just not going to comment on that. And our conversations that we have with people, we keep private. So you're not going read about them in the paper or a book. So that's just the way we do business and we're continuing to do that.","Obviously, there could be consolidation within the industry. Certainly, Sprint and T-Mobile would be a possible combination of companies. And if there were to be a combination of companies, we'd take a look at it to see whether we thought that that combination was detrimental to the consumer or detrimental to competition or not. And we wouldn't be opposed to consolidation just because it's consolidation. We'd only be opposed to it if we thought it had an impact on competition. So, we haven't objected to some consolidations in the past out there. And others, we have. And I think we're kind of like the justice department. We look at each \u2013 and the FCC. We look at each case individually and try to make a judgment as to how that's going to affect competition.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ben Markus with Colorado Public Radio. Please go ahead.","Ben Markus - Colorado Public Radio","Hi, guys. Just generally looking back at the last few quarters, how is it that subscriber base and revenue is eroding yet profits are going up? Are you just becoming more efficient as a company?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Ben, it's a good \u2013 I think it's because we've really turned our investment to the future investment \u2013 the majority of our future investment to connectivity and obviously in spectrum purchases so that we can be a viable company in the 21st century. So the return on investment in a mature industry normally declines. So the return on investment from a customer that we would go out and spend $800 SAC from 10 years ago is a different profile than if we go spend $800 a SAC for a customer today given the rising cost of programming and the decline in viewership of traditional linear channels. So I think we're just trying to allocate our capital more precisely. And what that has led to is pretty flat revenue.","I mean, most economic metrics over the last couple years have been pretty flat for us, but we're building for the future and so you, while you're investing in the future, you're not going to get those revenues from the future. So we're just building on our first networks. It's going to take us three years to build our network, so we're not going get a ton of revenue from our investment for three more years, right? And then we think that that jump starts a whole another growth phase for DISH.","Operator","We'll take our next question with Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks. Question for Mr. Ergen. I'd just like to follow-up on your answer to Craig's question. Were you saying that effectively, if Verizon or AT&T wanted to buy your spectrum to support their existing business that you wouldn't sell it to them no matter what the price is? They have to share your vision of the future if you'd be willing to sell it? Or lease it to them?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Jonathan, when did you get in the press?","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","I...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","You're such a great investment banker and analyst, you know, and now you're in the press? I didn't know that.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","I'll do anything to speak to you, Mr. Ergen.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I appreciate that. I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that, obviously, this is a board decision. If somebody came in and said, here's cash offer and you looked at tax consequences that offer was more than you thought you could do with your business yourself, that's something that our board would consider. To extent that you took equity for something like that you'd want to make sure your equity was going go up in value more than staying your current course. And so those are all the kind of considerations that you'd want to have out there.","But the \u2013 most management in public companies has a hard time taking a long view, right and making long-term investments, because they get pounded by everybody if their sales go down or their earnings per share missed by a penny or whatever. So they have a hard time, which is why you see crazy offers where you can get \u2013 I mean, you could get Apple TV box that costs $150 but you could get it for $105 if you sign up for three months of programming that probably costs $150.","So in that particular case that company probably lost $300 on every customer they got. Well, why would you do that? You might do that for strategic reasons but we also want to make sure your numbers don't go down for Wall Street. Well, I'd prefer to save the $300 and then put it into something else that's going make money long-term. So we really think the wireless industry is right for a new way of doing things and a new way that you would build a network and new architecture, take advantage of 5G and the Internet of Things and I don't doubt that there are people within the incumbents today that share that vision, right? Whether they can get through their boards and take long-term measures, it might be a different story. But to extent, they could I think they'd be attractive people to talk to.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Great.

Today's conference is being recorded.","And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jason Kiser. Please go ahead.","Jason Kiser - DISH Network Corp.","Thank you. Thanks for joining us. We're joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman; Tom Cullen, EVP of Corporate Development; Erik Carlson, our CEO; Brian Neylon, President of DISH; Warren Schlichting, President of Sling; Steve Swain, our CFO; Paul Orban, our Controller; Tim Messner, our General Counsel.","Before we do our prepared remarks, turn it over to Tim for Safe Harbor.","Timothy A. Messner - DISH Network Corp.","Thanks, Jason. Good morning, everyone. We ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in your reports. We also do not allow audio taping and ask that you respect that.","Statements we make during this call that are not historical facts constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and\/or from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties and other factors that we have in our SEC filings. All cautionary statements that we make during the call are applicable to any forward-looking statements we make wherever they appear. You should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our filings and should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which we assume no responsibility for updating.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Erik Carlson.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to make a few brief comments on the quarter. Then I'm going to pass it along to Steve to discuss our financial results. So on the last call I discussed that we view the business through the following lenses: We have a mature business in DISH TV, a growth business in Sling TV, and we're developing a future business in wireless. And Charlie and Tom are here, of course, to answer any questions on that.","Now with respect to DISH, while the subscriber trends have changed and our subscriber results reflect that on a macro level, I'm pleased with the operational discipline the team has brought to the business. The discipline is showing itself in churn, service, customer experience, and earlier this year we celebrated two J.D. Power awards. We built upon our number one ranking in customer service nationally awarded to us by J.D. Power and our customers. And this quarter, we added to it as DISH ranked highest in customer satisfaction for in-home service technicians by J.D. Power.","Now, look, I usually don't like to dwell on our accomplishments, but a lot of work, by thousands of dedicated DISH frontline employees goes into that kind of recognition, and I want to give credit to where credit is due. That gets us to our strategy.","We ended the quarter just under 11 million DISH TV subscribers and as we said among our gross adds, we're focused on acquiring and retaining long-term profitable subscribers. The recognition from J.D. Power among others points to the way and how we're really managing the retention side of the story. And a few focus points: Churn is at its lowest rate in four years, our acquisition strategy really boils down to quality over quantity, we've improved our subscriber mix by increasing the overall credit profile, we're focused on key geographies like rural areas where we have deep roots and a long history, we're attracting and retaining subscribers who are investing more in their entertainment and are really seeing the value of a powerful platform like the Hopper and are staying with us longer.","Now because the disciplined approach to not only acquisition, but retention, subscriber losses are slowing. And as of this last quarter, we're now seeing four consecutive quarters of year-over-year churn improvement, which is exciting for the team. As for Sling TV, we're the leader in live OTT streaming. We ended the quarter with 2.3 million paying TV subscribers and that's a 36% year-over-year subscriber growth, despite some increasing competition in the area. Now as with DISH, Sling is focused on a deliberate strategy to attract and retain long-term, profitable, economically rational subscribers. Sling TV offers something really no other service does and that is the most choice and control.","Sling TV has the most choice in programming starting at just $20 a month. Sling has the most choice to customize your programming. It's not just a large bloated bundle. Sling TV has the most choice in devices for a 10-foot TV viewing experience, or on the go. And Sling TV has the most choice to integrate free local channels with an antenna and an AirTV.","Our leadership position in Sling has allowed us to stay ahead of the curve with customer experience, and I want to give you a quick example. Recently we shaved seconds off the simple act of changing channels on Sling, and it provides a smoother more elegant viewing experience. It's really a small thing, but details matter, and it's making a difference for our customers. Because OTT services as you know don't often require a contract and customers are able to come and go as they please, our approach is to serve customers and think long-term. In our view, it makes no sense to heavily fund subscriber growth through unprofitable offers. We think that short-term strategy is not financially sustainable.","So as we think long-term, and with rising programming costs, we're focused on margin expansion in areas we're better able to control. And we're pleased by the increased adoption of add-ones like our extra packs and our cloud DVR, which really increase the value of a Sling customer. And as we continue to grow, we're growing also our Sling TV ad sales. For example, during March Madness ad sales for Sling revenue nearly tripled year over year, which is driven by substantial growth in programmatic and addressable advertising sales, really tapping into digital advertisers.","So as we move forward as a management team, we're focused on a deliberate disciplined plan to deliver a great customer experience and value on both DISH and Sling TV as we look towards our future business in wireless.","With that brief update, I'm going to turn it over to our CFO, Steve Swain, to briefly walk us through a few notes on the numbers.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Great. Thank you, Erik. First, some context for the results. In the quarter, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard ASC 606. This adoption positively impacted DISH's net income by $27 million. Additional disclosures can be found in our 10-Q, including comparable results under previous guidance. The numbers I reference today will be as currently reported using ASC 606 guidance.","So moving to key results, starting with revenue. Revenue was $3.5 billion, down $222 million or 6% year over year. This decrease was driven by a decline of DISH subscribers, partially offset by increased Sling subs. In addition, ARPU declined $2.05 due to the higher mix of Sling customers, as well as DISH cord shaving and rightsizing.","While our DISH rightsizing initiatives may create short-term ARPU pressure, they offer a better, more disciplined, longer-term customer solution in comparison to simply offering loyalty credits. These initiatives, using customer-friendly save tactics, as well as activating higher-quality subscribers are working. As Erik mentioned, we've seen DISH churn achieve multi-year lows. Our rate pressure was partially offset by a DISH price increase in the first quarter and higher Sling ARPU driven by improved take rates of higher price packages and increased ad sales and DVR revenue.","As we move to expenses, subscriber related costs were $2.2 billion, an improvement of $58 million or approximately 2.5% year over year. This decrease is primarily the result of fewer DISH subscribers and a decrease in variable cost per subscriber, partially offset by significant programming rate increases. Subscriber acquisition costs were $196 million, $94 million or 32% better on a year-over-year basis. This decrease is primarily driven by the adoption of ASC 606, fewer DISH activations, and a decrease in acquisition spend for both Sling and broadband subscribers.","At Sling, we're using a disciplined approach to acquire customers. We're not using the crutch of subsidizing paid TV with other product lines. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, certain sales incentive payments made to third-party retailers were booked as incurred. Now these costs are deferred over the average customer life. The impact of this change decreased P&L acquisition costs by approximately $40 million.","The DISH SAC metric was $707, an improvement of $57 or 7.5% year-over-year. This SAC metric, however, includes incentive payments as incurred, which makes this metric comparable to prior periods. The decrease in SAC was driven by lower hardware and advertising cost per activation and the reactivation of subscribers in Puerto Rico. Lower hardware costs were partially due to higher \u2013 the higher percentage of remanufactured receivers, and expenses incurred to reactivate customers in Puerto Rico were lower on an average per-sub basis.","Satellite and transmission costs were $154 million, $23 million or 13% better on a year-over-year basis. This variance was primarily driven by decreased up-link services expense. Selling and admin expenses were $170 million. That's an increase of $39 million or 30% year-over-year. This variance was primarily driven by last year's favorable legal settlements. If you adjust 2017 for these onetime legal items, our G&A spend was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. Interest expense was $3 million on the P&L, a decrease of $26 million compared to last year. The decrease was primarily related to an increase in capitalized interest. We expect interest capitalization to continue throughout 2018. Other expense was $35 million, an increase of $40 million compared to last year. This change primarily resulted from an increase in unrealized losses on marketable securities.","EBITDA was $670 million for the quarter. Excluding other expense of $35 million, noncontrolling interest of $18 million and revenue recognition's positive impact of $36 million, EBITDA would have been $687 million. Income taxes were $116 million, down $91 million year-over-year. This decrease is primarily the result of income tax reform. Less pre-tax income of $96 million also contributed to lower book income taxes.","Free cash flow was $387 million for the quarter, down $152 million year-over-year. This variance is largely attributed to last year's substantial working capital benefits and lower EBITDA this quarter, partially offset by lower PP&E spend and less cash interest. Consistent with our general intent to pay down debt, last month we paid a $1 billion maturity with cash on hand. Although we do not provide targets, we continue to focus on free cash flow and leverage.","With that, we're ready to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first portion of Q&A is for analysts only. And we'll take our first question from Philip Cusick from JPMorgan.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. Two if I can. One for Erik. Sling is clearly a great product and growing nicely, but as content costs rise, how long can you afford to not raise Sling prices? And how do you think about the competitive landscape in the over-to-the-top space? And then for Charlie, can you talk about the hurdles of getting to the 5G technology that you're really focused on building with, and how could that network tie into an evolving telecom and data center landscape over the next few years? Thanks.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Let me take a first, Charlie.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. You might. Yeah.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Hi, Phil. So obviously programming cost is a large expense for us, and understand kind of where the market is with not only Sling but OTT, OTT pricing. So as I mentioned in some of my opening remarks, I mean, we have to be focused on obviously the customer experience and bringing value to the equation. With that said, obviously margins are thin and we have to constantly reevaluate not only what we're paying for programming, what programming is on the service, what programming we could have on the service to make us more competitive and pricing along with that.","Now one of the things that we are focused on, I mentioned in my closing remarks was really trying to monetize the experience. So, keeping our prices as low as we possibly can for obviously entry-level packaging. And that would be either our $20 orange package or our $25 blue package, but then the monetizing our customer relationships with the add-on packs that I mentioned like our extra packs, obviously our cloud DVR service which is showing growth, and then the ad sales that we have on Sling which I mentioned and gave you some context to as it relates to how we saw March Madness ending.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, Phil, it's Charlie. So I think there's clearly a number of hurdles for us to get to 5G. Let me just preface it with what we're doing in the 5G network is a little bit more inclusive in 5G than maybe what you read about with the incumbents and their 5G. They've got to focus on their 100 million customers, or their 60 million customers, or 120 million customers. So, their 5G is going to be very consumer \u2013 I mean, customer-focused on their phones. And where we see 5G, all the benefits of 5G in the standards, a lot of that takes a lot more than just doing things for voice and data to a handset.","And you're correct that EDGE compute and storage is part of how you get low latency, and if you get low latency, it's how you get into things like autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence and virtual reality and all these other aspects. So there's a number of hurdles for us to get there. The one that we're focusing on, obviously, is our build-out of our first phase of our IoT network, which is narrowband IoT network, which we have 669 days to accomplish. So if we don't do that one, then it's kind of hard to get to the second phase. The second phase is way more encompassing. It gets to true nationwide 5G.","So the focus really is on that first \u2013 that first hurdle and, Tom, maybe in another question Tom can speak to that. But that's really the focus. And my experience in business is you have hurdles you can predict and then there's some you can't predict and you have to have a team that works together, that trusts each other, and you can overcome \u2013 you overcome those hurdles. And that's how we approach it, and it's not our first rodeo. We had those similar circumstances of hurdles when we decided to launch our first satellites back in 1990, and we had probably greater hurdles than we do in building the 5G network, but we had to focus on the task at hand. And when I say focus, I mean you're not \u2013 there's \u2013 you don't spend one extra second doing something you don't need to do. You focus totally on the task at hand.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. I just have a two-part question for Mr. Ergen. The first one is not so much around debt covenants, but around Delaware law. Based on where your stock is and what you paid for the spectrum, are there any sort of constraints that exist in terms of moving cash flow out of the DBS entity to help fund the network? That's my first question. My second question is if there is a winner sort of in this IoT network space, doesn't it strategically make sense to recombine EchoStar and SAT so you have a terrestrial network augmented by a satellite network? Or does that not make sense? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","On Delaware law, I'm not going to try to be a lawyer here. I think the \u2013 maybe the gist of the question is how secure might our bondholders feel in terms of us paying back the debt, and I think there I can only say we have a long history of being pretty good stewards of capital, and we understand that we have debt maturities that come up virtually every year. And we're, again, part of what we're in strategically in focus is we're going to pay those \u2013 we're going to pay those back. So I haven't really looked at the law. I don't expect that I will.","The recombine of EchoStar and DISH, we do think, A, that satellite is a component of any IoT 5G network, that satellite would play a component. And you're reading a lot about certainly geosynchronous satellites could play a role, but you're also reading a lot about LEOs and MEOs. So in that context, there could be some synergy between a combination \u2013 recombination of the companies. Having said that, there are also the EchoStar guys that \u2013 it's not necessary to recombine the companies to get the benefits of satellite, and some of the satellite communications that DISH might want to use might reside outside of EchoStar and might actually be with other players.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Jason, this is Tom. I would just add that regarding IoT, the S band satellites are held by DISH, and so our ability to use S band associated with the NB-IoT network doesn't require any transaction with EchoStar. And to clarify on your first question, in terms of transfer of funds. As we stated on the previous call, we intend to be able to complete the narrowband IoT network with cash that's currently on the balance sheet.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. And, Jason, I think what you're trying to ask on the bond piece was, do the bonds have the ability to move cash out of the DBS complex? And the answer to that is yes. There's an RP basket there for restricted payments. It's a \u2013 we've had the ability to move money out. We've done it in the past. We don't have any intention to do it in the future. And I don't know if that RP basket number is disclosed, but it's a big number and I think most of the bondholders are aware of it.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","It wasn't so much the RP basket. It was just the stock market is, I think, sort of implying that your video business has negative equity value. And I just didn't know if that posed any constraints in terms of solvency to get cash out, but it sounds like it doesn't.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Okay.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jason Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. I have a balance sheet question for Charlie. So it's been well known to the market, especially from bondholders that the spectrum sits outside of the DBS credits. And as you alluded to, the covenants of the bonds are pretty flexible. So that's not new news. That being said, investors are increasingly getting worried about the core business and your CDS spreads are actually wider today than it was during the 2008 financial crisis.","So I presume you still want to \u2013 you want the cash flows of the DBS business now, but to the extent your cash flow is not enough to offset the EBITDA declines at DBS, and therefore your leverage is going higher. What options do you have to manage that ratio? And how do you look at the capital structure generally?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, again, I think, I'd probably answer the question same way I answered the previous ones. So I mean, I think we're good stewards of capital, and I hope our bondholders trust us that they're going to get paid. But the only way we can \u2013 sometimes my experience has been things become pretty skeptical and the skepticals start winning the day. And the only way that you can really silence skeptics is to go out and execute, and when we pay back bonds, then whoever is skeptical about that will be incorrect.","If for some reason we didn't, I guess the skeptic would be right. We spend every day here. Our job is to run our business and regardless of the structure and regardless of the ratios and regardless of some of the financial metrics to make sure that we have a plan in place, we're executing that plan to make sure that people who have had confidence in us to loan us money, get paid back 100 cents on the dollar.","Jason Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And we're going to do that.","Jason Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. And I also have an operational question. So on the subscriber-related expenses, as a percent of subscription revenues, do you expect similar margin pressure year over year in 2018 compared to last year's levels? Obviously content costs have been going up for a long time. But a jump in their line last year versus 2016 was pretty noticeable in terms of \u2013 again from a ratio perspective. So I'm wondering if it's a new reality of the cost structure of the business going forward in terms of the margin impact, or if there were some unique events that occurred in 2017 that may have exaggerated year-over-year increase in the line item (23:20) again as a percent of subscription revenues? Thank you.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Do you want to take that, Steve, or do you -?","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Jason, we generally don't give guidance. So that's number one. And then secondly, there is going to be a margin pressure on \u2013 as programming cost rate increases go up faster than some of our ARPU increases. We did have a price increase in the first quarter of this year, and so that was kind of midway through the quarter. So we will have a little bit more upward help tailwind, if you will, going into the second quarter. But beyond that, we really don't talk too much about what's going to happen in future quarters.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, I mean, Jason, I think the big picture is, is that this isn't the first time you've heard us talked about it. We've probably been talking about this for four or five years. But it's \u2013 would be difficult to have in the linear core, linear TV business, you can't have rate increases with declining viewership forever. And so several things will happen.","The rate increases could abate for long-term players, different forms of revenue in terms of being able to target ads better and things like that, that we have the technical ability to do but some of the content providers been slow to adapt. And in some cases, some programmers will get dropped from certain operators because they'll not \u2013 the customer is not asking for \u2013 necessarily for more content from current providers. They're more balanced with seeing their rates not increase or not increased as much. And so there is certainly a potential for \u2013 and every company may have a different idea about going and doing that.","And then there may be \u2013 hopefully there'll be renewed \u2013 having said that, I think there's a lot of things that linear content providers could do to reinvigorate their business. I've been fairly amazed to watch the rise of Netflix and Amazon kind of go unabated for the last four, five years with not a lot of strategic change other than perhaps OTT direct on the part of content owners. And again, there's a reason why people like things.","People like Netflix, and there's a lot of things that we could do in the current linear-style business that would be more reflective of what customers want. It's just that every \u2013 it's hard to corral everybody to put that on a \u2013 so that we could do \u2013 every contract we have is different. So sometimes you can take some content with you and offload it and take it on an airplane and sometimes you can't. But with Netflix, you can do that with everything.","So content owners, doesn't cost them anything to allow us to do that. They just are slow to do that. So there's just a ton of things we could do on the linear side of the business to make that a much more robust business. It just takes \u2013 it takes some creativity on their part and some \u2013 ability to take some chances and see what works and what doesn't work. So that's always been disappointing. And one reason we got in the OTT business and certainly one reason we started transforming to a connectivity company.","Jason Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, Charlie.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","And, Jason, on the OTT side, as Erik mentioned, we are seeing margin and ARPU expansion on Sling. So, we expect that to continue.","Jason Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Walter Piecyk from BTIG.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Just two quick spectrum questions. Are you planning on bidding in the CBRS\/PALs if and when it happens? And then if there's an NPRM on the C-band for this year, are you planning on commenting? Can you give us some kind of inkling on your thoughts on how that whole C-band thing should go?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Short answer is while I don't know the answer to that question, I would \u2013 but I would say that we've participated in virtually every auction in the last 15 years, and we tend to comment on rule makings at the FCC when we think we have something to add that maybe others or different perspectives when others perhaps haven't addressed it. But to the extent other people address our concerns, sometimes our comments or ideas, if that is addressed, sometimes we don't. So I'd say we're probably \u2013 historically, we're in the 50% range on rule makings and comments and probably virtually every spectrum \u2013 whether that streak continues, a two-year-old won the Kentucky Derby (28:38) a long time, so the streak is sometimes a hint. So sorry I really couldn't answer the question, Walt.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","That's all right. I mean do the satellite companies that I guess have ownership or rights or whatever you want to call it in that band, does it make sense to try and do something with them ahead of any movement on the C-band? Just from a...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","It's an interesting question, because the FCC has got a lot of power to set rules, and so it's not clear whether they need satellite \u2013 how much permission they need from satellite or how much they're going to go to a market-based solution versus regulatory solution. So, I don't know the answer to that question either.","But we understand satellites. We understand C-band pretty well. I started in 1980, we were in the C-band business, and we used \u2013 we \u2013 there was quite a bit of terrestrial interference from terrestrial C-band, terrestrial interference to satellite at the time. So we're pretty familiar with it, and I think, it's \u2013 I commend the FCC to look at really \u2013 it's one thing this commission is doing is they see 5G as a strategic technology for this country. And I think, they're correct and they're looking at a lot of different places, and I think they're being creative. And I think, I applaud them for doing that.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","And have you had any discussion with Sprint or T-Mobile in terms of things that you can do with them and partnering with them to build your NB-IoT network that might help them along with their approval process?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","If we did, we wouldn't talk about it here. But, I mean, I think...","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Okay.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","That \u2013 I think that \u2013 it's suffice it to say that we from time to time have a number of discussions. I think we pride ourselves as a company, we don't leak things and we don't disclose things differently to some people than others. And I think we're a company that can be trusted to keep our mouth shut and have private conversations, and we've had a lot over the years and we'll continue to have those.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Got it. So maybe Sprint will just leak it in the next couple of weeks, if it happens to be that way. I think, Rich wants to hop on with a quick question. Thanks, Charlie.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Charlie, just as you've been so out spoken on the topic of sports and the bundle, AT&T sounds like if their deal with Time Warner closes, that they're going to launch basically a bundle that for all of AT&T Wireless subscribers, essentially a sportsless bundle of, I don't know, 30-ish channels from all of the non-sports family of cable networks. Does that \u2013 I know with Sling you've kind of \u2013 you've got the two different packages, but do you think there's an opportunity to be more aggressive in a bundle without any sports if you look at what AT&T sounds like they're proposing to do?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I think the answer is that OTT opens up a number of potential mine fields for content owners that I'm not sure they've totally thought through. But from a consumer perspective, it can be a great product. So, OTT gives you \u2013 OTT opens up on the one hand tremendous piracy opportunities for consumers because Internet is just not that secure, as we all know. And you also are able to password share. You can share, I think in the Google, you can share six emails. So, it's probably not the \u2013 it's probably an area, if I was a content owner, I might focus a bit more on.","The second thing is that as you get into bundles, you're \u2013 OTT is going to get pretty close to a la carte. And so not only would you have a sports package, or a non-sports package, or maybe a news package only, or maybe a \u2013 you're going to end up with \u2013 I would predict, you're going to end up with packages, non-sports packages that have certain channels for this constituent and then you have a different one for different constituencies. And then consumers can move, with a stroke of a click of a button, they can move from package to package. So you're going to end up with a more a la carte world probably. And the concept of channels is going to start going away, and it's going to be more content related. And it's going to be interesting to see how all that turns out.","For Sling, I just \u2013 I challenge Warren and Erik to say where in that continuum of where we think this thing is going do we think we can make a profit? And let's go there. And let's don't go \u2013 just don't go to the place where we lose $40 on every customer or lose $10 a month on every customer so that Wall Street has a number that an analyst can write about. Let's be a bit more prudent about how we do that. And there are going to be skeptics out there.","We're going to take some arrows, so be it. But we're going to do the right economic thing. And we think there's places \u2013 Sling has a tremendous technology. So we have a lot of value in that technology. We can do things that other people can't. And then second, I think we've got reasonable flexibility in our contracts to date to go maybe to places that others don't. And we could go where other places, but we're not going to go where there is just no money.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Thank you very much.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Do you want to add something, Erik?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","No.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Okay.","Operator","And our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Two questions for Charlie and then probably one for Steve. I guess, Charlie, we all see the stock price. We sort of know what the market is pricing in in terms of your core business. But I'm curious as to your view of the pace of the decay in the satellite business given that you need these cash flows to service debt and pay for phase one over the next couple of years? The second question for you is curious how the IoT build-out is going for Amazon. We've heard you're using 10 megahertz spectrum over 40,000 towers. So any comment there would be great? And then for Steve, can you just tell us what percent of our sub \u2013 of your sub base is rural?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Okay. On the first thing, in a funny sort of way, the linear business hasn't decayed as fast as I would have thought it would. And to Erik and team's credit, we kind of took \u2013 we kind of \u2013 we kind of clean \u2013 did our spring cleaning over the last couple years, and so we've got a little bit stronger base. I think, Erik told me we had some percentage of unprofitable, it is very low today. It was probably in double digits before; it's very low, low, low single digits today of customers that are unprofitable. So it's not like people are getting free programming not to turn them off, or we give them credits, or as maybe in the past people have done.","So we've got a pretty solid base there. And, again, we think that that cash bodes out for the reasonable future for us. And then IoT and Amazon, no comment on that. I'm going to throw it to Tom to comment more on IoT network in general though, because I think it's important for people to know that we are in fact focused on that 669 days and we're going to meet that date.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, so since the last \u2013 I think on the last call, I mentioned that we had signed development agreements with base station vendors to build radios around this frequency specification. Since then, we have signed dozens of other contracts, including master lease agreements with tower companies, chipsets, we're working with deployment companies now. We've signed the core network agreement, which is being \u2013 that core is being installed next month. So we've ramped up the number of resources internally working on it.","The RF planning is underway now, so I don't \u2013 we'll see the results of that sometime towards the end of this quarter. And then from there, we'll move into site acquisition and permitting, expecting to get the first radios in the fall of this year, and begin installation late this year and then throughout 2019.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And I guess Steve on...","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Rural.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, morning, Marci.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","So on the rural question, the good thing about DISH and Sling is we have a solution for rural, which is the focus for DISH. And Sling, which is tends to be a little bit more in the urban corridors. We are gaining ground in small town America. It is our focus, both rural customers, where there's less competition, and high quality customers. We don't necessarily disclose the exact number, but we are focused there, gaining ground, and that's about all I'll need to say on that.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Hodulik from UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Maybe two on the wireless side, Charlie. A couple questions previously on potential partners. Is there a way that you can sort of characterize for us, or categorize for us where, or if, we should expect you guys to announce partnerships as it relates to either the infrastructure or maybe an anchor tenant for capacity? And then getting back to the \u2013 is there a way that you could help us size the narrowband IoT opportunity? It's just \u2013 I think, it's one of these things that's difficult to model, and if you could give us sort of any sense of \u2013 or how you look at the size of that potential market it'd be great? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. I'll take the second part of the question first. It's going to be difficult to size the narrowband IoT network because in part of it, it's kind of the first step you have to get to get to the total 5G network, and we're not even able to build the IoT network in 5G because the standards aren't \u2013 we had to order radios before the standard was set. And we're using \u2013 with some of the spectrum that we really need is still \u2013 has to be cleared by broadcasters or still has to be cleared by some of the government regulated agencies and that doesn't come online as you know on 600 MHz, for example, doesn't get all cleared until summer of 2000. So it's \u2013 so we end up with -","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","2020.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","2020. So we end up with a little bit of an oddball frequencies that aren't exactly the standard we'd like to use. So the way I would look at it is, I wouldn't look at the \u2013 we've disclosed we're spending less than $1 billion on the narrowband IoT network and you shouldn't expect that we're going to make big profits on that network, but \u2013 in day one, but what it does is the foundation then for where things go.","And then the first part of the question was \u2013 I don't think you should expect announcements on partnerships and anchor tenants kind of thing. We're working with \u2013 we're working with partners today, in a general sense, I mean the equipment manufacturers, tower companies, maybe not all the tower companies you've heard of, but tower companies and others, we're working with today already. And then there will be other people that I know are willing to help us, and we're going to need help and we're going to need partners and those partners don't have to be -people who put in capital they don't have to be anchor tenants. It's very similar, we launch satellites.","We ended up with a lot of people have helped us and we had never built a satellite before. We'd never launched one before. We never built an uplink center before. We never built a digital set-top box before. So we had a lot of people that helped us, and some of those companies people had never heard of and they did a great job to help us. And we're going to need help on this one as well.","But the scope of what 5G can do and the scope of how 5G, every industry needs 5G. It means that there's a lot of willing participants out there to help us. And you know, I hate to be long-winded here, but there is virtually no industry that doesn't need a connectivity network, right? And when you look at the industries of the future, where things are going, you look at artificial intelligence, you look at autonomous vehicles, you look at Internet of Things, virtual reality, or augmented reality, smart cities, all right, all those \u2013 robotics, healthcare, agriculture, industrial production, what's happening is that the digital revolution is going from digitization of the software to digitization of physical things and processing. And you're only \u2013 the current networks weren't built for that. And so you need a network that's built for that, and there's just so many people that need that, that we're really in a pretty good spot there.","So \u2013 and I realize that \u2013 we're not \u2013 we're cognizant that people are skeptical. It's a big project. I'd probably be skeptical if I was on the outside of this company too. Right? But I'm not. I'm on the inside of this company and therefore, I'm not skeptical and I know that there's people putting \u2013 there's a dedicated group of people who are putting their heart and soul into making sure that we get there.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","And our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Cathy Yao - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi, there. It's Cathy Yao in for Craig. I actually have two questions. The first is that there's been a fair amount of press reports recently on the shortage of labor available for tower climbs. Is that something that you've seen as you've begun to look at the process? And can backlogs negatively impact your build-out schedule?","And then my second question is on accounting. Can you confirm that the $707 SAC for your DISH satellite base includes the $40 million in rev-rec restatement? Or does it exclude it? Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","You want to take the second part first, Steve?","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Yes, Cathy. The $707 does include the $40 million. So it is comparable \u2013 it's comparable versus prior periods.","Cathy Yao - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. So total...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And hey, Cathy.","Cathy Yao - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Oh, good.","Cathy Yao - MoffettNathanson LLC","Go ahead.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","No, I'm sorry. Did you have a follow-up to Steve?","Cathy Yao - MoffettNathanson LLC","Yeah, I just wanted to confirm that total satellite SAC was $210 million, and Sling SAC would have been $47 million, then?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","We don't breakout Sling and DBS.","Cathy Yao - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","But maybe somebody as smart as Cathy, can figure it out it sounds like.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","And there's other items in there including for broadband and things, so it's not as clear.","Cathy Yao - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","And, Cathy, this is Tom Cullen. I'm just \u2013 as I said earlier, we're in discussions now with deployment and site acquisition partners around the country, and we do not anticipate an issue with the tower climbing resources or construction. But you're correct. There are shortages of resources. We just have anticipated that and believe that that is not going to be an issue for us.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Right.","Cathy Yao - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay, thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","All right. So operator, we have time for one more before we go to the media.","Operator","And we will now take our final question from the analyst community. . And our last question will be from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So just a couple from me. The first is on debt, Charlie. So when you think about the leverage levels right now, and as debt maturities come up and you invest in your IoT network and so on and so forth, overall over the next couple of years, do you see leverage levels remaining where they are roughly right now? Or going down coming \u2013 how should we think about leverage as we go forward?","And the second question is more on the FCC communications recently with respect to the designated entities. Is there any timeline on when the FCC has to come back with respect to the new structure that you've put in place? And is there any implication in terms of cash flow or any assets that may come back to you? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, this is Charlie, I'll take them. On the designated entity, the court basically said the FCC was within its rights to decline the discount of $3.3 billion, but they also said that they should have negotiated with the parties. And so it was remanded back to the FCC to, in fact, negotiate, which is historically how the FCC has done it so that you could restructure a company to qualify it for some reason they thought you didn't qualify.","That process looks like it's \u2013 the FCC has come out with orders now with the timeline, and that looks like, to make a long story short, the first, I think sometime in early June is the first time that something is due from the designated entities and DISH, and then there's a couple rounds, and it looks like that goes into the fall, and then the FCC would make a decision on that.","And, again, obviously, we believe that \u2013 and we publicly made some changes with the DEs to the structure already that are very material already. There are potentially cash flow implications obviously because based on the current FCC ruling, the spectrum would \u2013 that was to be $3.3 billion spectrum could be reauctioned and DEs and DISH would be -have to make up any difference in the auction proceeds up to that amount. So that could be a negative cash flow in certain circumstances. Obviously, it'd be a positive in the sense that to the extent that the negotiation is successful, and in fact the DE \u2013 the structure is acceptable to the FCC or to the courts, then there'd be additional assets but no additional cash. So that's the nature of that.","And then on the debt levels, you'll have to make your own kind of estimates, but the debt maturities are well known. When those would likely to get paid down, then you'll have to take an EBITDA number on the company and run your own ratios there, right? And I think that you'll have to look at that. But we've always said that we're pretty comfortable with that kind of debt ratio as we have today, and that there is a limit to where we think we would go, where we'd be uncomfortable, we're comfortable now but there's certainly a limit where we'd be uncomfortable.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take questions from the members of the media. And our first media question comes from Scott Moritz with Bloomberg.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg LP","Great. Thanks. Charlie, the Sprint, T-Mobile deal has now been announced as you're aware. You have been in the past interested in both of those entities as potential takeover targets. Maybe now you can explain or give us a sense for what the landscape looks like to you in terms of your strategic options?","And then a second question on 5G. How are you going to be able to finance a build-out of a 5G network without significant partnerships? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, Scott, so obviously there's a logic to why T-Mobile and Sprint want to go together. We certainly understand why they want to do that. And we will certainly monitor that situation with \u2013 make sure that competition \u2013 to the extent that that merger were to be approved in any way that competition doesn't take a back seat. But I think in terms of what we're trying to do, it's a little bit different than where they are in terms of \u2013 because we don't have handset subscribers, we don't have 300 million handset subscribers, we're attacking a little bit different market.","With what people in the industry who really know what the capability of a full 5G network would be, with a clean sheet of paper, that's a little bit easier to do than trying to do that with a legacy network. So that's a focus. And we've said all along that we think we need strategic partnerships to achieve our goals. And it doesn't have to be equity and money. We are going to need people with expertise that share a like vision of where 5G can go. All the things that that does, and all the industries that affects, we have to have people with like vision to want to see that happen. So we won't be successful as a lone wolf out there. We're not that good.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sheila Dang with Reuters.","Sheila Dang - Reuters","Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to ask what do you think about Comcast firming up its bid for Fox? And where do you see yourself in all the dealmaking in the industry?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","I didn't hear that. Comcast what?","Timothy A. Messner - DISH Network Corp.","Comcast (51:52).","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Oh, I just read that Comcast (51:59). I think that I don't know the answer to that question. Obviously Comcast continues to see value in content and studios, and in some cases distribution in the UK. So, I think that's probably a positive sign for our industry that they see value there, or continued value there. The broader question I think is going to be what's the regulatory environment \u2013 starting with in four weeks we'll find out where the judge is on AT&T Time Warner.","Obviously, Comcast has said if that's approved, then there'll be a bidding war for Fox. And then if that deal is approved, there'll be another deal. So I think you're starting to see the seeds of some pretty potentially some major consolidation efforts out there. Or depending on the ruling with AT&T Time Warner you may see a bit more of a cold shower out there. So we'll have to wait and see. We don't have any insight into that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Farrell from Multichannel News. Please go ahead.","Mike Farrell - Multichannel News","Hi, guys. I just had a quick question about content. I'm just wondering if you guys see any opportunity or need for DISH or Sling to get into that business? And also kind of earlier on the analyst call you were talking about how you're a little surprised about how Netflix and the rest has gained so much ground, and that you saw opportunities that programmers could do to kind of combat that. I mean I'm just wondering what your suggestions are? I mean, do you see programmers kind of opening up more to loosening the bundle for you? Do you see more opportunity in packaging and even thinner bundles than what you're offering with Sling?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, I think that, a) we're not likely to get into content creation. Skills set we don't have. It takes a different skill set. It takes a lot of capital. It's a little bit of hit or miss. And we're just not that company. So we've stayed away from it. And we've always felt from a distribution point of view, we shouldn't be in competition with our distribution partners.","And then on the current business today, I mean, I would hope that, as an industry, we'd focus on piracy and account sharing. Because I think there's a fair amount of money that's left on the table, and once you let that go, it's really, really hard to put the genie back in the bottle. And our company has concerted efforts to do that. Some other companies do. But they're not coordinated. With probably better coordination, we can do that. I think that the advertising load has to be addressed. We tried to do that long before and ultimately came in with AutoHop because we just couldn't get anybody to look at that. And of course, the initial reaction was to litigate that as opposed to find good solutions. We were a little ahead of the curve on that one.","Now I think it's not too late to go find some things. There's simple things like how video-on-demand could be improved so that you can binge view channels. So you can take channels with you, simple things that could make some sense. And I think at some point we're going to have to eliminate the channels that have no value, but you have to take them to get either retransmission consent or channels that just nobody watches but you pay for them because it's just an added tax to the channels that people do want to watch. And so you've got to address some of those things or start addressing some of those things. And I'm hopeful that there's going to be some content owners out there who will take some chances to try to do some things.","Timothy A. Messner - DISH Network Corp.","Operator, we have time for one more.","Operator","And our final question comes from Paul Buckman (56:29) from Communications Daily.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you for taking my questions. My questions have to do with ATSC 3.0. One month ago today, as a matter of fact, you announced the partnership of getting involved in the Dallas trials of Sinclair using your 700-megahertz E Block spectrum. I'm curious if you can comment on what those trials have told you so far. Also, what your long-term ambitions might be in 3.0.","And finally, your reaction to Sinclair calling DISH a surprising partner given that DISH and Broadcast has having always been on the same page at the FCC? Thank you.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, Paul (57:11), this is Tom. Obviously, we wear different hats when it comes to these relationships, but with ATSC 3.0 we see it as a pretty intriguing technology, and so therefore we were willing to co-invest with some of the broadcasters on testing the technology. Candidly at this point, it's just a technology trial. We're measuring things like propagation and single-frequency network success. It's not at the point where we're contemplating services deployment, but we think there are synergistic opportunities for us to work with the broadcasters in ATSC 3.0, not only with the 700 E block that we deployed, but potentially with some of our uplink channels.","Timothy A. Messner - DISH Network Corp.","I think that was the last question, right?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yep.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Yes.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","All right. Thanks, everybody, for being on our call, and we'll be with you again in about three months.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Kiser, you may begin your call.","Jason Kiser","All right. Thanks, Kyle. Thanks for joining us. My name is Jason Kiser; I am Treasurer here at Dish Network.

Since most of you have undoubtedly read our 2014 financial results press release, we will immediately open up the phone for your questions. We have about half an hour for the Wall Street analysts, and then time permitting about 15 mins for the press. ","With that let's get started. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Marci Ryvicker","We are going to miss you at CES. I just wanted to let you know that. And Charlie two questions for you. Now that the AWS-3 auction is over and it feels like you have all the building blocks that you need. We are all curious about not only how you plan to monetize the spectrum asset but about the timing. And given the build out requirement, do you feel any pressure to do something sooner rather than later?","Charlie Ergen ","Okay, thanks, Marci. First of all, just to make just thank Joe for his service of almost last four years and it has been a pleasure to work with Joe. It has been lot of fun and I've learned a lot and I think our teams learned a lot and he is also really help build our team and we are in good hands with next generation of management here at Dish and we are going to miss Joe and we wish him well. And in his hunting and fishing and whatever things he is going to be doing and but he is left -- I think the mark of a really good CEO is what you leave behind and maybe we will take a little bit step backward but we are going -- our best days are going to be ahead of us in part because Joe has left us in good shape. As far as the auction, obviously the auction was a big piece of strategic piece of where we needed to go. I'd started with really there were two things that we needed to accomplish in the auction, both of which I think we were able to do with our partners, our DE partners. One was we obviously need uplink spectrum to go -- we needed to build it to go all down link with their spectrum if we could. So we've realized we have the option to do that. It was a next year to go all down link if we so choose. We now have the ability to do that because of the uplink spectrum that our partner acquired in the auction. We think we have the option to do that, let's put that way. And obviously we believe there are lot more value in down link than up link. The second thing was that the FCC has made clear that if there is a large players in this auction they will fight for interoperability between the AWS-1, AWS-3 and AWS-4 band, interoperability is super important for all of constituents in this auction but certainly Dish as well and I think that there is momentum now to see and certainly the FCC has made a promise on interoperability and I think that that's a real positive in terms of where we go forward. So that leaves us with the build the fact we haven't been talked to anybody for six months in this industry and now I think the lines of communications are open between them, the players in the industry. And potentially players that are in this industry today. And we will spend -- our first focus will be to make sure that the DE that we work with will acquire the long forms and get the licenses issued to them and then we will have strategic meetings after that to decide kind of what's the best path forward is. That's a. And then the second part of your question, we have a rule here that we do it right the first time. And we don't feel pressure to have to do something tomorrow. Many analysts have misreported our build out requirement so let's just kind of set through record straight of that. In our AWS-4 spectrum, we have until 2017 for our milestone and 2021 for our second milestone. If you miss the first milestone which is to build I think Tom 40%.","Tom Cullen","Yes. ","Charlie Ergen ","40% of population then you lose one year that the penalty is that you lose one year on your second milestone. So that if you were to look at from that kind of longest term scenario then you have up to 2020 to meet your milestone of building I think is 70% of the country. So a lot of that will depend on strategically how we move forward and some of it will depend on the technology. But probably most important that the speed at which we can move forward will be what the big guys will try to do and call 3GPP. So what happens in this industry is as soon as you become a competitor the big guys take you on and try to stop you. They try to stop you in Congress, they try to pass laws, they try to file against you an auction, they try to do -- and they try to go against in 3GPP, they try to go handset manufacturers and they cause all kinds of mischief. And one of the things they do in 3GPP is they try not to get your band approved. And so you have to do that before any handset manufacturers will manufacture product so we have lots of battles ahead of us. And the same guys that are going to be filing against build out schedules are going to be doing their darndest to stop this in other ways. And FCC is not na\u00efve about these things. And we will -- once we get approved in our brand 3GPP, first we got to get the spectrum, second we got to get approved in the bands and then we are having the ability to build out. So those are all things that we have to get done. And will certainly have more information for the street and for every analyst as we move forward. But obviously we are in a good position strategically at this point. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open. ","John Hodulik","Okay, thanks. Charlie, how do you feel about potentially selling up may be a portion of your spectrum holdings like the 700 block that you have as opposed to selling the all spectrum together? And then could you talk a little bit about the advantage of a longer term leasing arrangement that -- to some of other players in the space that may need to access some of your spectrum as their capacity needs grow? Is that something that you would entertain? Thanks. ","Charlie Ergen","The short answer is yes. We would entertain that. I mean those are two options out of probably dozen options that we have. Look, we are going to entertain those things that will provide competition to this market place. We will entertain those things that are good for our shareholders. But we are not walking in with -- this isn't something we have predetermined things that we are going to do before we have a conversation with people. There is people both in industry and outside of industry that are interested in this industry and particularly the spectrum and I think there will be a lot of conversations over the next few months. ","John Hodulik","And just quick follow up. Why don't move ahead with a structure that would allow you to efficiently sell that spectrum, pending tax issue way now? Is there reasons why you won't create a separate structure or do you need to do to make that happen now?","Charlie Ergen","Well, again we don't have preconceived notions of what we are going to do other than ideally as we said on virtually every call we've had the last five years, our dream would be to enter the market place and provide meaningful competition. But structurally we will look at every structure that make sense for the company. If you ultimately made a decision that you are going to sell the spectrum or you that thought there was a likelihood that you might highlight because you might do, you might have a different structure, you might structure your company differently. But we haven't -- again that is not a decision we made yet. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman","Hi, thanks for taking the question in. You said earlier that you may have the ability to use the uplink that you purchased in the auction to take advantage of all the downlink in your other bands. I am just curious whether the word may carry the nuance that we don't fully understand. Then just beyond that you have obviously tapped into your balance sheet pretty significantly and were to fund AWS-3 purchases. Do you have a different philosophy now going forward in terms of the amount of leverage you are comfortable with? Are you going to run the DBS business differently and do you think you have the ability to buy more spectrums if that was an option going forward? ","Charlie Ergen","Well, it's a lot of questions by at least some amount. The uplink -- realize that in this auction we ultimately work -- we ultimately were unsuccessful as Dish to acquire spectrum, the price just got too high for us to look at that economically and think that that made any sense. But we were fortunate to work with two DEs that are set up by the FCC to participate with the discount. But we don't control those companies. And they get to run their own ship and so while we think we are may be one of the few if not the only person that could use the unpaired uplink spectrum, there is no guarantee that they want to work with us to do that. They may have other things that they want to do. So that's why use the word may. About other parts of the question, in terms of how we run the business differently. I think we run -- we think there is a lot of Dish's material business, we talked about that. Its core business, Roger, he is starting the business that probably has kind of the new wave of -- for some people to get new people into the business that probably has some upside but the core business is a mature business and we will run that as a mature business and we will run it to -- with both our eye out look for opportunities what we think there are some to grow that business. As far as we used a lot or most of the cash that's available on our balance sheet in this auction. Currently we've been obviously saving it for long time. It was a best investment that we felt we could make with our cash. We obviously think that to extent that they become future opportunities, that we have to address those and see whether a careful structure make sense to participate in other things. But this was the thing that has made the more sense in the last five years to us and we were patient until we found the best place to spend our capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is open.","Jason Bazinet","Thanks. I just had a quick question on liquidity. I may be doing the math wrong but it seems like when I look at the cash on the balance sheet and some of the payments you've made to the FCC, it seems sort of tight, do you mind us walking us through sort of the how you are thinking about liquidity through March 3rd?","Charlie Ergen","I would say it is tight compared to company used to -- they had $10 billion on our balance sheet but it is not tight, it is not tight for company to generate approximately $1 billion a year in cash flow. So we feel comfortable, I mean I don't know, Steve you may want to jump in here with some here with -- but we feel comfortable in terms of where we are from liquidity point of view including the fact that we have a bond payment due in May as well but we feel comfortable that liquidity is not an issue. ","Steve Swan","That's exactly right because the underlying Pay TV business is free cash flow positive. We are satisfied with our current cash balance. But as such we will access the capital market opportunistically going forward. ","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Philip Cusick from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Philip Cusick","Hi, Charlie. Thanks. I wondered if you could talk about the broadcast auction. As we look out a year, does this have anywhere near as much importance as the AWS auction did? Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","Well, the broadcast continue auction I think is very important and I think the importance really is may be a little bit but it tuned to what T- Mobile has been saying and what their CEO said last week or so which is that low band spectrum is -- to be successful in wireless you have to have a combination of low band and mid to high band spectrum. Mid to high band is obviously for capacity and the low band is for coverage. And probably the strongest asset that AT&T and Verizon have is they have virtually all of the low band spectrum so that their networks, when they brag about their networks in part it is because their coverage is better because of the low band spectrum. So, yes, the FCC wisely is trying to set up the incentive auction, the broadcast incentive auction so that there can be some set aside for non the major non incumbent so they can actually get some low band spectrum to compete. And that's very, very important. So I would say, I would say, a, it is an important auction because it is spectrum. And second it is an important one to level the playing field from a competitive point of view and I'd agree with what T- Mobile is saying in the sense that I would hope that about at least half of the incentive auction spectrum would be set aside for essentially new entrants who don't have critical mass of low band spectrum. So I expect it will be -- depended on how they set the rules up, it will depend on competitive auction it is. I mean to the FCC's credit on this last auction, they set the rules up to make very competitive auction. And as a result they have the largest auction in the history of the world I think in terms of communication auction spectrum even though wasn't that much spectrum and even though some spectrum unpaired, the uplink spectrum was impaired, they value the downlink spectrum was a such it was a record auction. So they set the rules up correctly and provide a competition where competition has been lacking in some of the previous auctions that we participated at.","Philip Cusick","So given your comments about liquidity a minute ago, should we be ready for you to rebuild the war chest here, as you look out into that auction?","Charlie Ergen","Well, I think that a lot will probably happen between now and in the next incentive auction I think. The timing of the next incentive auction is still questions about that. Certainly the big guys are going to want to delay it probably and little guys are going to want it as soon as possible but you still got to bring a third party which is a broadcaster to the table in a way that's fair to them and that they wanted to participate in, so there is lot of jockeying for position but we are hopeful that the FCC can have the auction, if the auction comes about next -- this time next year, we hope to participate. We have a skill set for auctions that we have skillful team for auctions; we are knowledgeable about spectrum in a way that we feel confident. So we just have to see what the rules are and when in the timing of it and where we are as a company at that point of time as to -- and whether we can afford to participate or not, is also all questions that have to be answered. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk from BTIG. Your line is open. ","Walter Piecyk","Thanks. Just I want to go back to a follow-up on the comments that you would access the capital markets opportunistically. Is equity one of the things that you would consider using opportunistically?","Charlie Ergen","Yes, this is Charlie. I mean I don't think I think that answer we could give on every conference call, which we always look at the capital markets and say are there opportunities to make sense, do you have some of the use to money, we actually had kind of negative arbitrage for a number of years and which probably wasn't to the benefit of our shareholders and so we prefer not to do that. But you also raise money when you don't need it sometimes because we are pretty conservative. So when it comes to capital structure I think that today we don't have any plans today but if there were something that made sense and it could be any combination in a market place we are receptive to something and it could be debt equity converge whatever else, I don't know what else you can do, you can sell your kids, we look at -- the market sometimes some financial instruments just end up been at right time at the right place because of the market, because of the position, we are certainly look at that. Investment bankers are smarter than us and that kind of thing. ","Walter Piecyk","You answered Phil's question on the incentive auction. But if I want to ask about two other chunks of spectrum that are out there, if you would have comments on whether you have interest in them? First is the 2.5 spectrum. I think Marcelo and your friend Massa [ph] have talked about potentially selling some 2.5. Would you have any interest in buying that? And then similarly, there's a chunk of that 2.5 spectrum in New York that NextWave debt holders own a piece of. So to the extent that they are selling 2.5, does it make sense strategically to buy the 2.5, either from these NextWave ex-creditors, or if Sprint was going to sell some of the stuff?","Charlie Ergen","Well, I mean obviously to the extent that there is spectrum available we take a look at it. 2.5 is given the success in the last in this auction with mid band spectrum, it is probably not as attractive but it depends on price. The interoperability of the current -- of the last auction made it more attractive, the propagation characteristics make the last auction more attractive but obviously there is an ecosystem that will develop for 2.5 and to extent some becomes available and we think that been in that ecosystem make sense to us. In the prices wise we certainly take a look at it if we get afford it certainly. There is no really auction; I think in management, we try to stay away from preconceived notions. We are happy to negotiate with people before the ground rules are set. And this isn't Middle East peace treaty where it starts off with we don't trade this land; we are not going to have a conversation. We don't put preconditions on negotiations. Rather you try to talk to people about you can improve their business and improve your business and both shareholders come out in a win-win situation. That's a much productive way to talk about things. ","Walter Piecyk","And Charlie, you have been vocal on the risks posed by that Comcast\/Time Warner Cable combination. Just curious if you think the government will seek to block the deal? And what would be the risks posed to your recently launched Sling TV, if the government allows the deal to proceed?","Charlie Ergen","I'll let Stanton start with that one. ","Stan Dodge ","I'd say I think we will stay out of the handicapping game as to where we think the government is thinking but we will say this, we didn't announce to show-- if we are foreclosed by Comcast or Time Warner, our Sling TV business would still be viable. So if you put those two together and the exercise their monopoly power over 50% of the homes with access to broadband in this country that Sling TV wouldn't make it.","Charlie Ergen","I would just add that Comcast and AT&T over the top services if you believe that services are moving in that direction which they are obviously around the world and starting to have in the United States with things like Amazon Prime and Netflix and Hulu then Comcast and Time Warner aren't would be competitors. There is regional propaganda that they put out is not accurate. They actually become national players in OTT side. They would use each other's networks, right. And they are not likely to cause lot of problems to each other and they will be natural competitors. That goes away in a merger. And I think that's a real risk of competitive nature in the industry. Roger, you deal with this; you want to add to that. ","Roger Lynch ","Yes. Just to the point Stan made about they are controlling more than 50% equally or in more important control 19 of the top 20 markets which is where we think the main key opportunity, in terms of skewing younger people win over market. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amy Young from Macquarie. Your line is open.","Amy Yong","Thanks. Two questions. Charlie, should we expect that you will stay on permanently as CEO, and running the day-to-day operations? And my second question is just on programming. Can you quantify the impact of Fox in the quarter? And also any impact for 1Q? And what term might look like? And I guess you have a pretty high profile deal coming up with Viacom. How do you view the importance of that programming at this point in time? Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","First answer is I certainly will stay on as CEO until I can find somebody better. And I am sure there are people better than me out there. So but on other hand I think there is talent with Dish today that may come along with a little bit of nurturing and certainly as somebody gets better than me. I am obviously capable of firing myself. So you can be confident that when one somebody is better they will be running this place. Obviously not just Fox but obviously we had CBS down for short period of time. We had Fox, we had Turner Broadcasting. Those are all negative impacts to your company short term. And you have to balance the short-term negative with the long-term risk that you are paying too much for programming. And so we know -- for us it is pretty easy in part because we have got good finance team and we know what -- we know generally what our customers watch and how many hours they watch a particular networks and we analyze what the value of network is by how much our customers use it and how much they value it and how many hours they watch. The network itself they have an only playbook which you are paying us x and we want x plus 10%, next year even though our viewership might have gone down by 10%. Well, that math doesn't add up. And the industry can't survive in a situation where content providers want double digit increases but they got double digit decreases in viewership. And it gets compounded by the fact that the content providers also have diluted their programming to some extent by selling the same content to other providers particularly some other OTT providers with their contents now available then that dilutes the value to product and of course over the next few years that will decrease the viewership from the MVPD platform at least -- so that we have to balance all those factors together and you end up in a situation where -- I said this before the programmer will self select They will ask for price increase so high that we or others will just say based on viewership if we make more money long term by taking you down. And not providing you programming. And so we are fortunate that we value our relationship with Turner and CBS and Fox and while it is painful for us and probably for them and we certainly will lose some subscribers out of it. I mean certainly it impacted the fourth quarter; it will impact negatively the first quarter. We have long term deals that make sense for us and make sense for them. And we are really happy that those relationships can continue on because we think highly of those companies and think that they are going to be long-term players in the content business. So as far as Viacom, it is one of our better relationships, we just renewed a new deal with them with Epix and so they are value content provider and I think that as eventually we don't talk about our negotiations per se but as we get in timing of those things but as we get into those things as long as we are treated fair, our customers are treated fairly and we are treated fairly, we would be hopeful that we will continue to for long time with Viacom as we have for 20 years. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Vijay Jayant ","Charlie just wanted any color on Sling TV so far. It is been kind of early but any color on the breakeven points and Disney keeps mentioning it is an experiment and there is some sort of caps on it. Can you give us any detail on the real scope of this opportunity? Thanks. ","Charlie Ergen","Yes. I'll let Roger address it. ","Roger Lynch ","So I mean first of all we only just completed the commercial launch two weeks ago. So we were in -- invite only a day before then and really completed the full commercial launch in February 9. So I mean early results are encouraging but they are obviously just early results. We are seeing really what we expected so our strategy really has been to go after people for whom traditional Pay TV doesn't meet their needs. So these are people who don't have first of all Pay TV large like, so we are skewing younger, we are skewing more male as we expected. We started with the free trial so lots of people came in with a free trial. And it is little early to tell sort of long term what this means but we are encourage by it and as I said we are really focused on the segment of the market with traditional Pay TV is not.","Charlie Ergen","And I wouldn't -- I think it is bit more than experiment today. I think we know that there is demand from people who particularly for something like ESPN for people who ready the blogs and you read so forth for they say, I can get my sports and I was having to go to my parents house and or was having to go to bar, I just wasn't watching the game and so there is a lot of people happy about that. But I think the more interesting thing will be when Sony launches their product which is in fact as we understand it a much more comprehensive OTT product and really I think will be a direct replacement to cable and satellite and phone, video subscriptions and I think that will be more interesting how because that will actually have an impact on the MPVD market. I think we are interested in the incremental business. But I think Sony because we are not in the -- they are not in the current environment; don't have a lot of investment in infrastructure like cable and phone and satellites companies do. I think they are more ought to be more disruptive. And I think that will be -- it is competition, we are okay with competition. But that will be more disruptive. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open","Ben Swinburne","Thank you. Sticking with Sling another quick question for Steve. I guess Charlie and Roger; do you think the programmers' mindsets have changed over the last six to nine months? Is sort of seems like externally anyway that they are looking for over the top to the new revenue stream in a way or I mean over the topically outside the bundle in a way that wasn't true a year ago. If you agree with that, do you think that has implication for your business on the Sling or Dish front? And then Charlie just going all the way back to your Sprint plans couple of years ago, you talked about mobile and Pay TV and sort of bring those together as an interesting way to attack the market. Is Sling a foundation for you might do in wireless? Is there anything any relationship between those two or you view them as a totally separate? ","Roger Lynch ","This is Roger. Let me just start with the programming side. So I think it was four years ago Charlie and I went around and starting meeting with some of the programmers to talk them about the ideas we have around over the top. And it was clear, it was very early for them in their thinking and there was a lot of I would say concern as the competition ","At that time about you might upsetting the apple cart and what it is mean for the overall industry. There was interest but there was some trepidation. And after we launch, we announced the Disney deal and through those negotiations we found that Disney was concerned about the same things we were which is how do we grow the Pay TV market, how do we get people whom traditional Pay TV bumbles are not meeting their need. Then that was really a watershed event in the industry and we've obviously announced several programmers since then. And I'd say today contrasted to four years ago, there are more programmers who are concerned about not being on the platform. Today are about being joining the platform. So I think there has been a significant mind shift amongst the programmers, with that majority of the programmers because they've seen the trend that we have been seeing in the industry too. They realized that they need to give response.","Charlie Ergen","Our hope is that as we work through the programming partners that are working with us with OTT that when they add all it up year from now or two years from now or five years now they did better than better they made more money than they otherwise would have with perhaps other ways they could distribute their product. And obviously getting people who aren't paying for TV today or people who have the cut the chord or will never buy it or we will buy this product and ultimately moving into a house and buy a bigger package later. That's an important thing and then the advertising where we can do advertising on one-to-one relationship and do a much more meaningful interactive type of advertising and the data that can come out of all these to make their businesses better. We think that's first time that we are able to have a win-win conversation with the content provider as opposed to they just want -- normally the conversation is they want more money, they want a 10% increase in their product and they have 10% lower viewership, that's a zero some game conversation. But when you start talking about how we get people who aren't watching you today and we get more money for advertising on a per ad basis. And we make it more appealable to a customer and they can watch it on every device, both inside and outside the home. That's a win-win conversation. And obviously Roger and his team spent a lot of -- has spent the last five years development technology to do it. As far as your second part of the question, it is part of a strategy. Sling is a part of strategy to take content to a more mobile basis to more wireless basis because that's the way the next generation is going to watch television. They are going to watch as much or more television on a phone or a tablet or computers as they are in a big screen TV. And if that's going to happen then how do we have to have the infrastructure to do that. And so part of that foundation for any wireless project that we would do that we can envision that we would do are in partnership with somebody would involve a heavy deal of -- heavy dose of video and content and we believe we've developed a platform that's precursor to do that on a wireless network. ","Ben Swinburne","And if I could just quickly ask Steve a question on a financials, given the free cash flow comments earlier, what can you tell us about the tax outlook because you guys have had de minimus cash taxes last certainly in 2014 but you don't have any NOLs, any guidance you can give us on cash taxes for 2015 or what might impact in terms of accelerated depreciation or anything?","Steve Swan","You can take the book taxes and then you can make assumption that some of our accelerated deprecation will continue into 2015. There is a book to tax accelerated depreciation help that Congress has given us a couple of years, that is called bonus depreciation and that should continue into 2015.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Your line is open.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you. Just a couple of questions. The first one is on all the content use. Now that you also have Sling in the picture how is the nature of the negotiations? Whether it is with Turner or Fox or any of these other entities changed? And are you negotiating this on a combined basis? I know some of these deals are not on a combined basis but how you are going forward in all your content deal? And secondly just from the funding perspective, when we look at the total amount of cash that have been put into the designated entities, it is obviously much higher than the amount that is required as a proportion of the 85%. And obviously there is likely some equity funding for how these businesses do in the future and so on? So if you could just help us with how we can think about the funding of the designated entities going forward beyond the spectrums needs, that would be very helpful.","Charlie Ergen","Are you want to take the second part, Tom Cullen will take the DE how they might fund.","Tom Cullen","I just commented in the short term there are several hurdles if you will that are in front of us with the DE is moving forward. So first we will go through the approval process with the FCC, secondly there will be a lot of work with MTIA and the various federal agencies that are currently incumbence on the uplink of the paired advance so that will take some time to clear and as Charlie said earlier, duck tailing that with the 3GPP effort you are probably looking a year and year and half out of those things take time to get completed. In that timeframe then you will have better visibility as to when that federal incumbence will be vacating the spectrum and therefore that impact the timing associated with any build and operating expense. I would note that -- ","Charlie Ergen","You might mention the build out schedule on this auction. ","Tom Cullen","Yes. There is a distinction obviously with the earlier build out discussion this auction AWS-3 spectrum has a 12 year build requirement from the data the licenses are issued so we anticipate that some time mid year after the DE long forms have been approved and then that's a 12 year build schedule with an interim milestones. If the interim milestones that is not met the build schedule is reduced to 10 years. So you got to keep in mind these are two different planning horizons but as Charlie said previously we like to do first right the first time and so we are trying to take a holistic view of all of our spectrum holdings to say how can we anticipate band plan developing that would take into account H block AWS-3, AWS-4 and even E block. One encouraging move in that direction was during the December 3GPP meeting the RAN plenary group which is Radio Access Network did adopt 70 by 90 BM plan should that incorporate AWS-3 and also included 20 megahertz of AWS-4. So that's a first step in moving towards AWS-4 interoperability and ecosystem development. So long story short other than the information I was disclosing in the 8-K is our prepared to share and regards to the DE structure today but as you can see from that there are opportunities for us to continue to fund the organization as they needed as those business plans evolve. ","Charlie Ergen","And there is obviously before you go for the capital, they could choose to do something different with their own capital structure. And so they probably better the guys to ask for that particular question. And then on the negotiations, each programming negotiation is different. In our business, Roger's organization with Sling TV and the core Dish business are separate entities. Separate P&L, so we don't necessarily try negotiations together and in some cases we have content providers who prefer not to participate in OTT and Sling TV today. And that's certainly okay with us. And then we've had other program content providers who would like to participate in both ways and in some cases they've almost -- they have seen the upside in the Sling TV side of it, they part of those negotiations with Roger's team and part now with Bernie's team. But we are not again we would like to have open -- our conversion is how we make more money together. And let's go from there and every time somebody convinces us we make more money, we have really good outcome.","Kannan Venkateshwar","One more follow up on the balance sheet. I mean what's the minimum amount of cash you guys require to run the core business? ","Charlie Ergen","Well, I mean when need to have all checks clear. We need dollar right because we are positive cash flow. I think we've always felt comfortable. I think we've always looked and said we would like to have billion dollars of cash or liquid investment on our balance sheet. And we just been -- you guys gotten a little bit spoilt with $10 billion on our balance sheet, when you take $10 billion and put it to work we think that's a good for shareholders, when you can get value for it. That's kind of what we've done. But you feel pretty comfortable as long as your cash flow positive of having de minimus amount of money because you got money coming in every month. ","Charlie Ergen","Operator, we have time for one more question from the analyst before going to the press. ","Operator","Our final analyst question comes from the line of Tom Eagen from Telsey Advisory. Your line is open.","Tom Eagen","Great, thank you. I have a follow up on a previous question. Hope you could provide some color and the language of the Sling TV contrast with the programmers. For example, are there any subscriber minimum that have to be reached? Are there any material differences between the deal with Disney and with other one? Thank you.","Charlie Ergen","You want to talk here, Roger. ","Roger Lynch ","Yes, just we don't comment on the details about programming agreement with our partners. ","Charlie Ergen ","They are confidential agreements so we will protect that confidentiality.","Charlie Ergen","All right. I think we are going to let the -- so thanks we will be back in May and the press is going to be on. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","We will now take questions from the members of the media. [Operator Instructions] Our first media question comes from Jimmy Schaeffler from Carmel Group. Your line is open.","Jimmy Schaeffler","Hey, good morning, Charlie. Coupe of future oriented questions. One is have you changed your mind in light of market place developments on marketing and owning content? And then second question is you talked about last quarter and I wrote about your comments on the internet of things and carrying Ben's question just a little bit further out, could you add a layer to what John Chambers and CNN said yesterday about the internet of things. And how Dish and EchoStar's future fits into those? ","Charlie Ergen","We'll start with content question. I mean strategically we haven't too excited about owning content. That's for a couple of reasons. One is we are not very good at it. It takes special skills and dealing with our content partners we realized just how difficult that is. So it is just not core competency for us. And the second thing is I have never felt like it was that productive for us to have a mindset here that would actually compete with doctor hunt and partners. So we have since started this company we've been open to all kinds of content, we are switch to one of content -- we are not competing with the people that aren't our platform. And we try to give all our content providers a fair shake from our marketing channel placement et cetera, pricing point of view and then kind of let the market place decide what they want and watch and we carry the most liberal of news to the most conservative of news. And everything in between and we are proud of that fact. I don't know -- it is not to say that there couldn't be content deal that made sense for us as a company but it is just not something we focused on much. I don't know what internet thing means but I guess Jimmy I would say this way that strategically I think it is always nice to keep thing simple. And if you can conceptually have a concept and you can build around it and for us the strategic concept with the internet of things is really that is everybody particularly the next generation is always going to want to be connected to the cloud. And they are going to be wanted to be connected to the cloud because every piece of information known to mankind is going to be in the cloud, right. And that information is also going to include video and entertainment as well as education news, healthcare information et cetera, right. So and you want to be connected, it is only -- you can be connected in two way that I know one is through a cable or piece of fiber and other is in wireless manner. And the only way you could be connected in your car or when you are outside walking and so for this in wireless manner. So that's what we focused on as to say how we have business that helps people always connected to information that they want. And that is about complex of strategies we have. It is pretty simple in nature and so that's why we focused on spectrum and obviously we will focus on how we can help build the network or partner with the network or work with people who have network that allows people to be connected to the cloud. And it is just going to take a different forms and there is anybody born today that isn't probably in every waking minute going to be connected to the cloud to their life, there is not many people that are -- there is not anybody who is left in five years old, they think when you have a phone call that you look at the person you are talking to. And you see him on the screen and there is not a person born today who doesn't -- isn't going to watch TV on a tab or a phone. So how do you make all that work and so that's really what we are building at Dish. And hopefully we are entrepreneurs after to help other people get involved in that system. Grow their businesses, we know what it is like to be small business, we know what it is like to be startup, to creativity in this industry is going to come from small business, is going to come from startup. We were really happy to work with the DEs on the auction, they are creative, they were tenacious, they were disciplined, they were better than we were as the big business. So they added a lot to that. We had to drop out and they did better than we did. And that's the beauty of small business. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mark from Bloomberg. Your line is open. ","Scott Mark","Joe, congrats. Charlie kind a question in light of that when you look ahead like maybe two to five year do you see Dish is being more of an acquirer or more of the seller asset? ","Charlie Ergen","Scott, it's hard to say it you mean I think that what we hope is that our best day is ahead of us, and we think that our best days are ahead of us, and we think we have the management team to get there. We think we have the assets that we don't have everything we need in terms of assets, but we're certainly closer than we were several years ago. And if there is assets that we need we might be an acquirer. If we fail or if somebody has a better idea or somebody has more scale than we do that would allow us to do the kind of things that we think we want to do for competitive products out there and for the next generation than we could be a seller. And everything in between. But our main focus is to build the good product and compete and you usually if you can do something Joe's is always pounded this into our head for last four years is by the consumer first and give them a great product. And then if you do that if I can be really good for your shareholders and for your employees. ","Scott Mark","Great. There was some discussion that -- reported that there was interest in team mobile that you would took to a DTE management would that be something we should think about going forward or is that less of an interest in that. ","Charlie Ergen ","Well, I think T-Mobile is a company we think highly I mean it's hard not to be impressed with what they've been able to accomplish in the last couple of years. But there is equally impressive companies, the other companies in the business is equally impressive companies outside the business that may want to be connected to the cloud. So we'll take a look at what normally happens is that ultimately the company's is get strategically aligned and they becomes a will to do something better than what they can do individually. And when that happens you have a chance to move things quickly now whether T-Mobile and Dish ever got strategic aligned is unclear, whether we get strategic alignment with somebody else is unclear is whether or whether nobody wants to do business with us at all, and all those things could happen. But when you can get people motivated in the same direction whether be employees or business or our partners then good things happened as long as long those motivations are to the same end. And we want to build -- I only tell you we want to build the great product, we want to make a great -- we want to compete, we want a great partner for consumers and it at its core is going to have video. That's what we would like to do. But we can find somebody else who wants to do that, whether we have to go alone or whether this is just stupid idea and we have to fold our tent I can tell you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Goldstein from FierceWireless. Your line is open. ","Phil Goldstein","Hey, everybody. Joe congratulations as Scott said surely two questions if I may, I know you've said that you're not pretty to supposed to do anything at all, it is all going to depend upon what conversations you have and how that all comes together, but building on your response to Scott's question, what factors would you guys need to have in place or consider in order to become strategically aligned with the partner in the wireless industry. And then you mentioned video as a core component of any wireless offering that you guys would want to have in the market. Can you just talk about how it would be differentiated from existing offerings or other things to carriers are working on in terms of -- can you broadcast. ","Charlie Ergen ","Well, I mean I think that look where we built the company and video for 35 years or so if we think and we think that video and I said this way that wireless system is now are going to be in the future data centric and video is going to be the biggest portion of that data. So we think those two things go together. It's possible that people have different ideas but we think there is a room -- we think there is more -- I would say there is more value and what we do at Dish Network even though it's a matured business than maybe we're getting credit for. Obviously AT&T saw that value in Direct TV to some extent. And that's how do you and then it's really how do you build a better product and how do you and look I hope that the wireless industry five years from now is materially different than it is today, I hope the cost per bid goes down, the fact that you can go between devices and not have to pay fee for this and a fee for that and all of data caps and all the -- and the things such that that have to be determined in terms of net neutrality and how your system operations and all those things. I hope that -- I just hope its consumer friendly. It's not surprising to me that I would say at least from my personal perspective that the company that's focused the most on the consumer has been T-Mobile and it's not surprising that they've got the majority of the net ads and industry in the last two years, and I think it's in part because of their strategy because I think they initially have the best network in the industry today. So they have -- ","Phil Goldstein","I mean just don't make it as the first part of the question what would you after consider in order to become strategically aligned with another company in wireless whether there are an existing carrier or not. ","Charlie Ergen ","Well, I think it would ultimately have to be good for our employees and our shareholders and it has to make sense alright. But it would have to be from my personal perspective it would also include the fact that you can build the better product, that what you would do strategically as a result of it the strategic relationship would be better than you could you by yourself or better than they could do by themselves. And that's a good starting point and then it has to be good for your shareholders and your employees. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Crow from Financial Times. Your line is open. ","David Crow","Hi, there. I mean I think quite a lot of criticism at the end of last week of how much spectrum you control following the recent auction. I think the lad just said you could sit on it for 10 years technically. So I just want to know how you would respond to that, and two if you could give a sense of any timeframe you have for making your intentions clear. If it's not 10 years then when. ","Charlie Ergen","Well, I mean I think obviously we'll as we as a public company we'll make sure people are understand our strategic stuff going forward when there is something to talk about. As far as a criticism of our auction participation I would say a few things first and foremost. One there was there were some criticism that we cost the -- first let me about the rules, rules were all set out they were proved by one of anonymous approval by all the FCC commissioners and everybody had a public notice to comment on the rules. And so we went by the rules. The second thing is that we didn't do anything that I think there was an AT&T blog they talked about what that we've created artificial demands and things like that. Well first of all, if anybody is been an option. We'd know that's impossible to do, we beat economically and every license that we bid on and we wanted to win and there was nothing artificial about it, we wanted to win the license, we're disappointed that we didn't win all the licensees right, but we're also economical and when it's impossible to stop somebody from winning the license, they all have to do is bid a dollar more right. So if you want to win New York City you got a bid a dollar more to win it, and you win it and there is nothing that anybody can do to stop you, there is nothing complicated by an auction, it's the guy that wants to pay the most money wins in the sense. And so what I think the criticism is unfounded because what's different about this auction was that the world -- that it's the first auction since the advent of data and the advent of broadband and the so the world of auctions before we're talking about spectrum for voice and texting didn't make a lot of sense and we always thought the auction would go as a result would go from more money than people thought it would. And as a result yes the first auction where people start to thinking about data and there was more demand for the product because of the demand on spectrum needs. And so we obviously all you it -- the only thing I can say is that whether people might call it artificial or loopholes in laws or whatever the people have to say, I mean it I would just say it's competition I mean it's just competition and not everybody wants competition, and this was the first competitive auction, and we are proud to be part of it and we're really proud to work with the DEs and we provide the competition to an auction that on the one hand people say cost the US Treasury $3 billion and on the other hand people say was $20 billion higher than it otherwise would be because we participated. Well you can have a both ways right, and I'm sure that in a competitive auction the tax payer was well rewarded, and I think we hopefully paid a positive role in that aspect and everything else is if you want to compete you've go to compete and that's all you can do. And in terms of build out, there is every wireless carrier today has spectrum that they haven\u2019t build out yet the wireless carriers that can complain about build are usually guys fighting you at 3GPP and fight you in Congress and fighting to keep you out of the business and I hope that they support us in our build out and all the things that we need to do, and all the regulatory stuff I hope they support us. And then they have clean hands otherwise they are hypocritical.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Malathi Nayak from Reuters. ","Malathi Nayak","Hi, this is Malathi from Reuters. Thank you so much for taking question in the media. Charlie, I was wondering why you've decided to be CEO again and another question I have for you is do you think the spectrum is worth more if you keep it or sale it? ","Charlie Ergen ","Well, I became CEO because, a, the things I was working on the strategic side are now in great hands with Tom with the wireless side all the things we're doing within and Roger on the OTT side. And with Joe leaving I thought it's a good chance to get back into the day to day operation and see, and I haven't spent really much time in the last four years and there is a lot of good people and management there. And I want to get know them and I think we hopefully we can make some improvements and much of the stuffs we do in our core business is going to be relevant to what Tom is working on and what Roger is working on. So it's just good timing to do that and I'm very appreciate the Joe allowed me to go do some things over the last four years that I think in small parts help us to being a strategic position. And then obviously with spectrum while we buy or sale it whatever I think we've answered that that I mean hopefully we're going to use it in a way that provides value to our company but also provides competition and good product. And how that manifests itself, I guess you don't hear much from CEOs but we don't have all the answers today. But I think when you grow a business from scratch and I think when you have the kind the team that we have we're very confident that we can build value and build great products here and we've done it for a long time and we think we can continue to do it and we think we can do it in the wireless industry. With that I just --","Malathi Nayak","Could I just ask one follow up question? Yes, thanks so much. So in terms of the scenario where you would keep the spectrum, would you consider perhaps some sort of business model where you could use the spectrum in partnership with other carriers for instance T-Mobile or Sprint? Could you see any value in that?","Charlie Ergen ","I think that's an option. I think virtually everything that somebody suggested on this call is potentially -- are potentially options, but it boils down to -- it boils down to management that's what we do. That's when we come to work here. And we think about it, when we meet as a team. We are thinking about all the things you guys are asking about. And then we ought to ultimately make decisions on how we move our business forward and so look it is a little bit early because nobody in this industry has been able to talk to each other for six months. And as the dusts clears here and everybody goes back and looks at what happened and sees how they -- if they got what they wanted or didn't get what they wanted then I am sure the conversation is will happen not only between Dish and other people but I am sure that other companies, I think somebody mentioned Sprint and their spectrum, other companies will have conversations, there is big mergers out there, what happens with Comcast and Time Warner, I think that's going to play a major role as to what the government decides through there. There is Direct TV and AT&T that's going to shift this industry depending on what the regulators decide. So those all are going to be factors in people's thinking. The only thing I am pretty sure of is that if you want to be competitive in this industry you are going to need spectrum to do it. And I think that Dish will be in a lot -- I think we are relevant and I think we will be in a lot of conversations. So that's for us, that's opportunity and I think we know how to manage, so we will see. ","Charlie Ergen","All right. Thanks, everybody. We are back I guess in a few months in May, April. I don't know. Thank you. Thanks everyone. ","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"7205":["DISH Network Corp.

We'll go first to Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Thanks and good morning. So, I guess, two questions. First, obviously there has been some headlines around SoftBank and Sprint. Obviously, you've tried to buy Sprint in the past. I'm just wondering if you could talk more strategically about maybe what has changed, what you might be looking for this time around. And then my second question is on churn. Obviously, it was much better than I think a lot of us expected. How do we think about churn going forward, particularly with Sling TV, where the characteristics of churn might be a little bit higher? Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","This is Charlie, Amy. I'll take the first part before I give it to Erik to talk about churn. Obviously, we're not going to \u2013 we're kind of the one \u2013 probably the one company that doesn't really respond to rumors, and we usually don't, as you know, leak things to the press. So we will just continue that tradition of not commenting on things. What I would say though is that I think that it's probably a better regulatory environment today than it has been over the last decade, really. So it's probably a two-year window where I think a lot are probably going to be increased.","There's going to be increased M&A and things beyond what it probably was in the past. And so I think that the communications industry \u2013 you've probably seen it in the content industry, I think you'll see the same thing in the communication industry. And we're not the biggest player out there. So we're probably not the one that's was going to be driving that train. Erik?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Hi, Amy. This is Erik. I guess first-off, we generally don't provide guidance looking forward. However, what I would say is, I think we're encouraged with churn and non-pay is running at a multiple-year low. I think we've talked about in the call before, there's probably three things I'd point to: one is definitely have a lot more discipline in place, from an acquisition perspective to look at acquiring customers that will be profitable and obviously, will be with us on a long-term basis.","And in addition, I think our sales strategies have been more effective than they have in the past. Some of that has to do with the work that we're not solely focused just on providing a credit for our customer or rightsizing them into a package that meets their needs, whether that's with Flex Pack that we've talked about before on the call, or whether that's through other tactics, whether it's renewal or upgrade, et cetera. So just trying to meet the customers' needs and finding a package and equipment that's right for them.","Then in addition, I'd say, obviously, there has been some operational improvements, we're executing better at a front-line level, both over the phone and face-to-face when one of our technicians is at the door. So, I think the combination of those three is encouraging for us from a churn perspective looking forward.","I'll let Roger comment on Sling growth, if there's a question there.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","No, we will wait for a question.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","I didn't hear the question on that.","Operator","Great. Thank you. And we'll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I just have a question for Mr. Ergen. Your neighbor there in Denver, Dr. Malone, seems to spend a lot of time going from net asset value stories and converting them into operating businesses and you've sort of gone, and I would say successfully, backwards, to essentially taking a stock that the Street values on cash flow and now values on spectrum. My question is, do you spend much time thinking about how that handoff can successfully occur as you stand up sort of a stand-alone business and the Street has to value, again, cash flows? Because I don't think there's any company that has a pile of spectrum where the Street values the spectrum discretely. It doesn't happen for Sprint or Verizon or T-Mobile or anyone, really. So can you just talk about that? And do you think about that?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I mean, I think about it. I think that any value of a company ultimately is going to be dependent on just get your cash flow. So, the company is not worth anything unless you can generate cash out of it.","Everything that we do that we think about strategically is longer term in nature and in terms of \u2013 in this case, building assets that we think are going to cash flow a lot of cash flow in the future. But you first have to \u2013 in our case, we have to \u2013 as we said, we want to become a connectivity company.","One of the ways we had to do that was \u2013 the only way we could see how to do it was in the wireless side of it. And the government had auctions. They weren't necessarily on our time schedule, but when the auctions happen, you either play or don't play. So we've been obviously the largest participant in the government auctions over the last three to four years, so. And we recognize that our core business is a mature, it's a declining business, which is why Roger came in to start Sling and why Erik and his team are pretty disciplined about where they spend money in acquiring new customers because we want only long term. We don't want customers for a year or two. We want customers that are net present value positive. So that's how we look at it. Obviously, for us to have to increase the value of our company, we will have to put those assets to use and they'll have to generate cash flow. But that's not something that you can snap your finger, in technology that's not something you can do in six months. That's going to be a long-term process for us.","And you look \u2013 in technology, it's usually timing, it's usually the critical factor. And in our case, 5G is a paradigm shift within the telecommunications industry for a variety of reasons and that's really kind of a 2020, and this means standards are not even set yet. So the standards have to get set and then you've got to get product out there. So you're realistically looking at 2020, 2021, 2022 to actually implement spectrum on a basis that uses the latest technology. And I don't think you want to spend a tremendous amount of money on last year's technology. So that's how we look at it. So again I don't think it's any surprise to be an investor in DISH, you've got to have a little bit longer term horizon.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. So I guess the first one for Charlie and Roger, what's the attractiveness of the OTT ecosystem, given all this new competition? Can you talk about where you are as well on the advertising ramp in this business, Roger?","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Sure. Yeah, it's Roger. I think you hit it on the head, Phil, which is the advertising side of it is an important element because what OTT does is it enables a new form of advertising, which is entirely targeted, and which targeting in effect just eliminates waste. So, advertisers are able to reach the people they want to reach without having to spend people they don't want to reach, therefore they're willing to pay more per impression, significantly more per impression for those ads.","And so that's always been an important part of our business case. And that part of our business is ramping. As I said before, the technology to implement that was harder than we expected. It took longer than we expected. But we think we have it cracked now. So now, it's just a matter of we're continuing to expand the number of networks on which we have enabled dynamic ad insertion and our ad sales team is doing quite a good job sort of selling those and getting strong CPM. So it is an important part of it for our business.","In terms of the overall attractiveness, I think if you look at what's happened with all of the competitors that have entered, what they have largely done is replicate the big bundle that the Pay-TV industry already provides. So either that's one bundle of channels, no choice, take it or leave it, or it's the nested model of big, bigger, biggest that some of the competitors have done, which looks a lot like the traditional Pay-TV bundles.","That was never our strategy. Our strategy was never let's just replicate what Pay-TV does over the Internet. It was let's create more flexibility, and let's go after a different segment, people who are rejecting traditional Pay-TV, cord-nevers, cord-cutters. And we knew that price was an important part of that. We also knew that over the air antennas fit into that importantly, because that was a growth market, people using antennas and Netflix as a good cord-cutter solution.","And so when we originally thought about Sling, we thought about it fitting into that ecosystem. And today, I think it really provides us with a competitive advantage over everyone else who is forcing you to buy locals and big bundles of channels versus our more flexible packaging.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And Roger, can you give us an idea of what sort of portion of revenue is coming from advertising at this point on Sling revenue?","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","No. We don't break that out.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thought so. Thanks.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","But the important part is not the portion of revenue, it's obviously the portion of margins. The margins on advertising are quite good.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","This is Charlie. I think it's fair to say that advertising will be a bigger portion of revenue and margin and OTT than it is in Linear TV.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Yes.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Charlie, can I follow up?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I was going to say, in Linear, has your view of Linear changed as the OTT system has broadened? Is it less attractive to compete in linear now given that people have so many more choices?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","The way I think we started looking at it was that when you're spending $800 SAC to get a Linear TV customer, that was pretty easy to do back in the day when the customer life cycle was going to be 7 or 8 or 9, 10 years, and the customer's only choice was to go to an inferior cable product, right? Now the customer has multiple choices. First of all, cable product is much better. He's got a phone company and there's half a dozen pretty good packages out there, from an OTT perspective. So now a customer really has about 10 different options, right?","So I think it's realistic to assume that a Linear customer today that you might get on randomly across the United States, the odds on that customer lasting 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 years is probably not good. So we just look at it and say, we have to knew that over the air antennas to get them. We have to be willing to focus on areas that may be not as many options for the consumer, right, rural America is an example, and be a little smarter about it and then bring in the new technology of OTT where the churn is going to be higher, but the SAC is going to be very low, and where you have an enhanced revenue opportunity with advertising and add-ons and everything else.","So I think we just change with where the market is going. And in our case, in Roger's case, he's actually leading the market there. And I think that we \u2013 when Roger \u2013 when we talked to programmers five years ago that was a new concept. I mean, I think today they all \u2013 I don't think you would hear a lot of disagreement with what I just said. And so the advertising model can get better and the Linear \u2013 the programmers would like their advertising models to get better and we have technology in ways to make that better on the OTT side, but we have some technology on the Linear side to make it a little bit better too as well. So we're doing both those things.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jonathan Chaplin.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks. A quick question on the opportunity on the OTT business, I'm wondering if the OTT opportunity as you see it, would that be something that would use all of the spectrum resources that you have? Or is there a scenario where you could build out a phenomenal OTT business and there'd still be opportunities to partner with existing carriers, with other parts of your spectrum to provide capacity to those businesses?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I'll take a shot at it, and Roger if you want to jump in.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","OTT or IoT?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","You are talking about OTT, right?","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","IoT, I'm sorry, no, no. I am talking about IoT, Internet of Things. Yeah.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yes, okay. So this is going to be a long-winded \u2013 in IoT, this is my belief is that IoT is going to use a tremendous amount of capacity, but it's going to take a bit of way to get there. Today's current IoT is narrowband IoT, machine IoT, it's still 4G, it still doesn't have some of the enhanced characteristics that are coming with 5G, things like URLLC, which is Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications, right? So there's kind of a phase, what I would say, a phase-in where, for us, Phase 1 with narrowband IoT, we won't use a lot of our spectrum in narrowband IoT.","Phase 2 as you get into 5G and you get into all the things you can do with comms, vehicles, and healthcare, industrial and municipalities and everything else that you can do in millions of machines with low latency, that's going to use a tremendous amount of capacity. And there's some use cases that would use way more capacity than we have. There is some use cases that would use less and obviously, the FCC is doing a really good job of trying to \u2013 and the Congress is finding other places that just \u2013 to have another sub inquiry in the 4-gig, 3.7 to 4.2 C-band area. All those things are going to be important.","But IoT in general, at least it's my belief, is going to use a lot of spectrum, a lot more than people think. But the first phase of our build-out, which Tom maybe want to talk about, and narrowband IoT will not use massive amounts of spectrum. You want to add to that, Tom?","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","I would just say we're making \u2013 we've got a growing team dedicated to the build-out of the IoT network. We're currently negotiating contracts with the radio access vendors. We've completed the preliminary RF plan for each of the license areas. And we're in discussions with the tower companies and other partners. So we're fully aware of the build-out of March 2020. And we intend \u2013 we fully expect to meet that construction milestone for both AWS-4 and the E Block by that date.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","And Tom just to follow-up on that. As you move from that first phase of narrowband IoT that doesn't use a lot of capacity, to the second phase where you're leveraging 5G and there could be a demand for huge amounts of capacity. Can you do that second phase, sort of, organically on your own? Or at that point, do you either need a partner with one of the existing wireless carriers, or maybe somebody who's got really dense fiber infrastructure, in order to really capture that opportunity.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, it's a little premature to answer that as to what the industry looks like in three, four or five years. Right now, we're just laser-focused on getting the initial deployment completed and continue to have discussions with various parties in the industry.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. And this is Charlie. I'd only add that you realize that we have nationwide 600 megahertz spectrum now, which is a great low band frequency, which is really a necessity in my opinion for a lot of the use cases of IoT. We can't actually use \u2013 we can't use that nationwide frequency, because there's still 38 months that the broadcasters have before they have to turn it over. And they're asking for more time at this point in time. So unfortunately, that's kind of after our 2020 schedule for the FCC.","And then we're still involved in litigation on some of the AWS-3 spectrum. We're still awaiting court decisions on that. So that's a bit tied up in terms of us making long-term strategic decision. So it just so works out that we're really \u2013 it just makes logical sense to go with a narrowband IoT and wait for 5G where we'll probably have some specs and some time we'll probably have some specs in 2018 and we can start planning that network.","And hopefully the second phase will come along as soon as 5G is available. And it's realistic to assume, I think, that we're going to need some help. And we need help in doing that both in technical knowledge and know-how and financial and everything else because just like we needed help to launch satellites. We launched our first satellite in 1995, and I think we've launched 21 or 22 satellites now. We needed a lot of help to get there, and we're not afraid to ask for help.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Great, thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tom Eagan with the Telsey Group.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group","Great, thank you. I have a question on margin trends. In the subscriber-related cost line, if you back out the $60 million in broadband costs this year and last year, the margin there declined pretty materially. So I was wondering how much of that is due to higher programming costs, and how much of that is because of the lower margin from Sling? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","You want to take that?","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Sure. Yes, Tom, it's a little bit of both. And so certainly, we're under some relatively intense margin pressure from our programming partners as well as just given the way Sling is currently priced, that is a lower gross margin product just because it has a lower ARPU.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group","Right.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","But what we're focused on is cash flow. So we are laser-focused on driving cash from both the DBS business and we have the opportunity to have margin expansion in the Sling business. So on the DBS side we're certainly focused on acquiring and retaining higher quality of customers and we're doing that by focusing on more rural geographies where we have less bundling pressures.","We're more disciplined on retention credits as Erik has already mentioned, and we are executing on several meaningful costs and revenue initiatives. And in order to offset some of the intense programming rate pressure, we are rightsizing our customers through some of our skinnier packages like Flex Pack. And we are also offering some integrated Hopper antenna solutions where customers can drop their locals and they can save money as well as, we'll as a company save on lower programming expenses.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group","Right. Okay. In terms of broadband, should we expect that the incremental costs there are going to continue and what is the market potential of that business? The subscribers appear to be declining quarter-over-quarter. So how big could that business be? Thanks.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","So just to remind you that in the first quarter, we entered into an agreement with Hughes, which allows us to market and install the Hughes broadband service. Hughes will make certain payments to us for each sale and installation. Subscribers acquired, however, under this agreement, are going to be Hughes-branded retail subscribers and therefore, not included in our subscriber numbers. So as a result, our broadband subscriber count related to the Hughes service will decline through customer attrition.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","That also affects the \u2013 that also affects \u2013 that's the biggest thing you see in the margin on the broadband side is that we don't have the SAC to acquire the customer. So we're getting a \u2013 so we have lower margin, but we don't have the SAC because we're just an agent for basically for Hughes, and we sell the product and get a one-time commission. So we don't have the margin that we had before, but we don't have the SAC. So from a P&L perspective, I think you'd probably say we feel like we're relatively indifferent which way we would do it.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Right. So as we pivot away from this wholesale model, we will see modest P&L favorability due to lower acquisition costs. Without ownership, owner economics, we just couldn't make the wholesale broadband business work for us. So we think this is a...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, it worked. It just wasn't the best use of \u2013 it wasn't the highest return on our capital. We had other places to put our capital.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","That's right, I think it's the right time to pivot away from that strategy.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group","That's right. Should we expect the cost for that, for broadband are going to continue or not?","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Net margin, you'll see a very modest benefit to the P&L. So we'll have lower revenue, but also lower cost \u2013 in that margin benefit, modest.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mike McCormack with Jefferies.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Charlie, just to comment on some of the carrier behavior out there, we've heard Verizon specifically talking a lot about small cells. How much of that is a risk to overall needs and desires for spectrum? And then maybe just a comment on the industry's health in wireless generally speaking, whether or not potential cash flow pressures on pricing down will also dampen the need or the ability, rather, to acquire spectrum? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yes, I don't know if I got the second part, but the \u2013 I think each carriers offer a little bit different strategy today. I mean, obviously AT&T is getting more heavily into the content side of the business. Verizon's got more of a small cell strategy and T-Mobile is just taking away a lot of the pain points that are out there. So each have strategies that those guys are a lot more knowledgeable about the wireless business than I am, so each of the \u2013 there's no reason that each of those strategies can't work.","Some probably are going to ultimately, history will show, will be better than others. But I think my general opinion is that that you're going to need kind of everything. You're going to need small cells, macro cells, I think satellite is going to play a part in connectivity. And in satellites, it's going to be GEOs, MEOs and LEOs. And those are all going to fit together in a system, because each customer is going to be a little bit unique. Sometimes they're going to be in a home in a city. Sometimes they're going to be in a vacation home in rural America. Sometimes they're going to be in the car. Sometimes they're going to be in an RV. Sometimes they're going to be in a boat. Every one of the \u2013 sometimes they'll be in an airplane, and each of those is going to have different connectivity needs. And so I think for our company, we're going to fit \u2013 we're going to go where we think our assets fit the best and where we can make the best return.","And it's going to be part of that ecosystem and we're not going to do everything. And I don't think that Verizon and AT&T are going to do everything either. But we'll focus on the connectivity and all the kind of peripherals and all the kind of layers on top that goes with that. So sometimes that's \u2013 but a lot of that is going to be video \u2013 in our case, a lot of that's going to be video.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Right. Charlie, then just a quick follow-up on the cable entry into the industry, does that change your view on the industry overall and your desire to do what you're doing, more strategy stuff?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","The cable industry?","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Cable entry.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","The cable players coming in.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, look, I think there's probably \u2013 I think the wireless business is already competitive. It's going to continue to be competitive. I think you're going to see cable industry in the business because they're connectivity companies too. And so they're going to be in the business. Probably I think a smart strategy of starting out with an MVNO strategy, but ultimately, they're going to want bandwidth and economics and the data and all the things that go with it. And they're probably going to enter the business sometime in a bigger way. And you probably also have other entrants potentially where people who rely on connectivity for their revenues.","So you're starting to have $500 billion companies out there whose revenue is just materially dependent upon connectivity, and they don't control any of that connectivity. In some point in time, they're going to take out insurance policies to make sure that they have a little bit more control of that, so you're going to have some dynamics that change in this industry. And we're going to have to \u2013 we're somewhat fortunate that we have more of a clean sheet of paper to just start with 5G and just start with what a network should be in the 21st century. So it's not built just on voice. It's built on machines, machine to machine, it's built on IoT, it's built on broadband and connectivity. And voice is just an app in that. Where most networks today were really built for voice, and they've added all the others \u2013 trying to add all the other stuff on top of it, and that makes for a more complicated and more costly network than I think we can do.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. Good morning, out there. I want to ask you, Charlie or Tom, just how your high-level thinking has evolved with respect to the range of strategic options for the wireless business, and how just directionally, the probabilities may have shifted over the past 6 to 12 months in terms of what types of companies you think you might end up partnering with as far as wireless incumbents or large tech companies, international players, cable, et cetera?","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Let me just comment first, and then I'll turn it over to Charlie, but it's also relevant to the last question. I think the focus on today's competitive landscape is really just around smartphones and tablets, right? The average smartphone probably consumes, I don't know, 5 gigs a month. Use cases that are being discussed around 5G that will start to materialize in the early 2020s, they're going to dwarf that in terms of the amount of data consumed whether that be drone network or autonomous vehicles or healthcare or massive connectivity. So to look at the marketplace in terms of today's four big competitors and the new entrants, I think you have to really think about how the market will get redefined in the next five years to seven years to ten years.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, I think there'll be some catalysts for how the marketplace is going to go. And again, we're not the biggest player. So we're probably not the guys driving that. But I think there's a relatively good chance that the current incumbents try to go from four to three. I think there is a very good chance that the cable industry decides to get \u2013 to play bigger rather than smaller ultimately. And I think there is reasonable chance that people who rely on connectivity will want to advance connectivity in any number of ways. They may or may not use technologies that are \u2013 may or may not use things that incumbents have today.","So, all those things are going to happen. The only thing I know for sure is that if you're born today in the United States, you're probably not going to have one second of your life you're not connected. And you're going to use a lot of data during your lifetime. And there's going to be \u2013 and that's just people. And every microprocessor and every light and every other thing is going to have a sensor that's going to be connected. And that's just \u2013 it's going to make us more productive. And it's going to save companies money. And so there's going to be very large companies coming out of the connectivity business on a big scale, and we hope to play a part in that.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","If I could just follow-up on that. There's been talk obviously of some of the large tech companies getting into the connectivity business, particularly with this next phase of the industry that you had talked about. Do you get a sense that that interest is real and that maybe some of those players are actually taking a hard look at it?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I mean I think you see \u2013 I think you've seen Google Fiber try for connectivity. I think you've seen Project Loon with balloons and things. I think you've seen Facebook with high-flying vehicles. So I think Amazon is looking at drones for delivery. So, you're looking \u2013 they're all around it. You're looking at Microsoft with White Spaces and things they're talking about. So they're all around it. And I think they're looking for new and creative ways to provide connectivity.","But at the end of the day, that \u2013 you're going to need a core \u2013 there's going to be some unlicensed spectrum and licensed spectrum, but you're going to need a core layer of how you connect. And I think that the four big incumbent carriers are pretty well positioned there. And I think we're pretty well positioned there too, because we're a cleaner sheet of paper. So, you don't have a lot of complexity and baggage of the old things. But there's a handful of \u2013 there's three or four companies that could peel off some money off the balance sheet and go buy incumbent carriers out there with maybe a little bit more than pocket change. But they could do it if they want to get it in a big way. So, we'll have to stand \u2013 we'll have to see how it goes. But I don't think you're going to be a very good company if you don't have tremendous connectivity going forward.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So Charlie, couple of questions, first on the build-out requirement, what gives you confidence that the present FCC will be okay with an IoT network in the end state and \u2013 because your investment plan is obviously defined by that. And secondly, there is a comment in the 10-Q where you talk about significant new investments for the network and so on. Is it just a continuation of the same comments you've made over the last couple of quarters, because the comment seems to be new. Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Well, I think there are rules for what \u2013 for your build-out and there's rules for our spectrum in terms of how to bring that into service. And we're \u2013 it's not, the rules don't limit you to voice or data or IoT or whatever but \u2013 and then there's a practical thing which is, you've got to \u2013 so, IoT's going to be a real business. You've got to start, there's nobody who's got a nationwide IoT \u2013 narrowband IoT business today. We're pleased to see that T-Mobile's also going to start building the business. I'd expect that maybe others will as well. Certainly, people around the world are looking at it. So, it's a real business. It's a real net necessity. It's a real productivity increase for any number of constituents in the United States. So it makes a lot of sense.","But we also have a practical problem, which is our nationwide 600 megahertz spectrum is not available for us in the timeframe that we have to meet our first deadline. And we're still in litigation. We believe we had followed the rules on the AWS-3 Auction, but that's in litigation today. Still to find out whether the FCC's decision was the right one, to deny us, to deny our partners the bidding credits. So it makes it difficult to plan when you have that much uncertainty. So all those things are going to \u2013 all those things should get cleared up in the 600 megahertz spectrum should come available, about the same time that 5G becomes available as well. So it just makes sense to do it in two phases, and that's what we're doing.","R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp.","And this is Stan. To answer your second question, the disclosure is effectively the same quarter-over-quarter.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I'm just kind of following on Bryan's question. Charlie, you mentioned Facebook and Google. You didn't mention Amazon. The papers mentioned Amazon, and the investors have mentioned Amazon. So anything you can comment with regard to Amazon would be great. And then Steve, two quick ones for you just as it relates to cash flow. Can you talk anything about maybe cash taxes for the year and how we think CapEx should be trending? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I mean, I think Amazon is one of those $500 billion companies that probably have to think about connectivity in their future. They have three main businesses, right? So their cloud business doesn't work unless it's connected. And that cloud business is connected by fiber a lot of times, but it's wireless too. And so they don't make any money if that's not connected. And their retail business is going to \u2013 future delivery is going to be drones or autonomous vehicles. Both of those are not connected, so both of those are going to need connectivity. And then they have a big video business now. And that video business lot of times, is watched on mobile devices. So, you need connectivity for that.","So I think they have to \u2013 look, I don't have inside information here, but they have to look at connectivity as part of their future. They may be able to do that if they could just peel off some money and buy one of the incumbent carriers, or they could lease spectrum, or they could just hope that the \u2013 I think everybody in \u2013 the really big companies have always assumed there's going to be a connectivity network out there that they can piggyback off of. And I think that if net neutrality rules get more defined, and I think you're going to find that it's maybe not quite as \u2013 you're not going to be quite as confident of that in the future.","You can't have all the profits going to three or four companies and have the guys that are \u2013 the companies that are providing them the raw material to make that money, not get wake up one day and get a little smarter. That'd be my guess, but I don't know if that's going to happen. But at some point, all the money going one direction, a lot of people are enabling that. They're going to wake up and say maybe they should get \u2013 I've been through this business long enough to know that the money ebbs and flows between distribution and content. It's probably going to continue to do that today. And a lot of the content companies, probably the distribution guys, probably are going to be in position to get a more of it. Then it may go the other direction.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","And Marci, your question is related to cash flow. So, I'll take a quick step back and talk about total cash flow. Just to around out DBS, I talked about the DBS margin. And as an offset to the DBS margin pressure, we are certainly spending less CapEx by using more remanufactured boxes, and we expect that to continue. And then looking at Sling TV, we believe that we will see margin and ARPU expansion as the business gains scale. So, Roger already mentioned it, but I'll reinforce that we have not yet fully monetized Sling's addressable advertising opportunity. And dishNET, I mentioned, is going to be a modest \u2013 it's going to have modest favorability on the cash flow side due to lower SAC. One partially offsetting the cash flow need is with the incremental debt, primarily from low coupon convertible bonds, our cash interest expense in Note 4 is up on a year-over-year basis.","And lastly to answer your question on cash taxes, without a sizable taxable gain on derivatives from the last year, lower 2017 pre-tax income, higher bond interest deduction, and planning for the incremental tax deduction from amortizing our newly acquired 600 megahertz licenses, we expect to pay significantly less cash tax in 2017, probably just state taxes.","R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp.","Operator, I think we have time for one more question from the analyst community before moving on to the media.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. We'll now take our final question from the analyst community. And our final analyst question comes from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Just a quick follow-up, Tom, I think you had talked about you have a network plan now. You have the number of cell sites that that network plan includes?","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Of course I do, Walt, but that's not something we're going to discuss, first of all. And then secondly, the standards around narrowband IoT continue to evolve. And so the ultimate tower count may be modified even lower, depending on how that standard develops.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Got it. And I just want to ask you guys the same question I asked T-Mo, which is that if you look at \u2013 Charlie, you obviously bought a ton of spectrum. So you carefully thought about relative value of the spectrum and whatnot. If you look at 2.5, is there a minimum amount of 2.5 spectrum you think that you would need to have for it to be useful? And if so, like how much is that? Is that 30 megahertz, 40 megahertz? And how would you look at that, the value of 2.5 spectrum relative to some of the recent auctions that have occurred, higher, lower, same value?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","It's Charlie. We looked at it several years ago when we looked at Sprint. And obviously, it was \u2013 I think the market had a much lower price on it, so we were confident that the kind of value that we bring on today, I think we haven't really looked at it recently. It's got a couple of things, one is TDD. So it's a little bit different. So you would need some critical mass of that spectrum to be relevant. And then I think the second thing is you've got to look at what the CBRS, potential spectrum of the 3.5 range. And now with the 3.7 to 4.2 going on public on notice of inquiry, I think the FCC just might have just passed it yesterday or today even. That will have some impact probably on the 2.5, but we haven't really looked at that. So...","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Do you support T-Mobile's view of CBRS, which is I think they wanted more license than I think what the FCC is currently progressing with, at least under the Democratic plan?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, it's a little tricky because the more changes you make to the \u2013 to where they are today, the longer it takes to get that spectrum to you. So, we really haven't weighed in on that because you're balancing the need to get it sooner versus perhaps some of the ideas that were floated including ones by T-Mobile and others that might have some merit, that might take a little bit longer to get out there.","And then I think it's also relevant that you should look at in context of what you might be able to do in the 3.7, 4.2 range. So I think those things kind of all go through it. Again, if I was looking at it as a system design guy, I'd look at all that together and say, how do I fit all those things together and try to keep innovation going, but also get money for the treasury, but also at the end of the day, make sure that we can use things to be more productive as a country and raise their base standard of living because we're more productive because of all the things that we can do with being connected. So, we really haven't weighed in on that one yet, Walt.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Charlie, just greenfield, just as a kind of follow-up on, if I look at DIRECTV's core satellite business, I think losses in their core satellite business went up like 7x year-over-year. DIRECTV NOW helped to mitigate the losses by a decent amount. I realize you don't break out between Sling and DISH on the satellite side. But just wondering, with all of this competition, not just from DIRECTV NOW, but YouTube TV and others, is that eating into your growth year-over-year in Sling, or is Sling actually accelerating due to that lower price point that Roger talked about?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I mean, I think it remains to be seen. More entrants in the OTT they're going to take market share away. That's the bad news. The good news is that people will become more knowledgeable about the category. And so you have a chance \u2013 that the category will grow.","So if you have something unique, if Sling can be unique and deliver the technically sound service with a great user interface with programming packages that appeal to people then they have a chance to grow.","As an example, we don't have ESPN today in one of our packages. But everybody else has got ESPN in their packages. So while you guys write about this all the time, I don't know what your number is. But I think you guys have said something like 75% of people don't see a need to pay for ESPN. I don't know, something like that.","Well, when all the packages have ESPN you've turned off 75% of the people. So Sling is in a position to maybe have some things differentiated from \u2013 so we have to look at that, beside it remains to be seen. And Roger will have to run his business and be creative, and take advantage of those things, right?","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","But is Sling still adding more subs this year than it did last year? I mean, is it still in that growth mode of acceleration?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, that remains to be seen too because we'll have to see how the year turns out. The one thing that there is with OTT that does not to the same degree, it is a bit more seasonal business, and the sports stuff is really seasonal, right? And HBO is really seasonal. So people trade in and out. So people will buy for Game of Thrones and watch it for a month and then turn off the service and people will buy for sports. They'll buy for baseball season or football season and then turn it off. So my gut feel is that OTT is still in its infancy, and it's going to see a lot of growth ahead, and Sling included. That'd be my guess, and I think it's going to...","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thank you so much.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, all right.","Operator","We will now take questions from members of the media. Our first media question comes from Scott Moritz with Bloomberg.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Great. Thanks. Charlie, at the beginning at the call, the onset asked about M&A and you said you couldn't comment. But you also said that you saw the activity picking up in the next couple of years. And you noted that with some resignation about not really being in the driver seat. So wondering how you see Direct DISH's role in this M&A scenario that you've outlined here?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I don't know that I \u2013 I don't have any resignation about it. I think that the \u2013 I look at it that you probably have a better regulatory environment for M&A. And you've got that for at least you could make decisions in next two years and probably feel better about the regulatory environment than you probably had in the last nine years, right?","So, I would expect that most companies and boards are looking at things that they can enhance their business. Because one of the reasons that you don't do M&A is because you feel like regulatory might be an issue. And you can't take the risk to your business of getting turned down or the breakup fees. So I just would think that there'd be more M&A activity.","And normally, there's a catalyst in that, right? And normally, that catalyst is somebody does something and then for every strategy, there's a counter strategy. And so somebody else says. if we're going to do that, I need to fill in a few holes in my company over here. I've got a chance to get bigger this way. And AT&T did that on the \u2013 it was kind of a catalyst on the content side.","And I think that you probably see something and now you're seeing some stuff in the content side with Discovery and Scripps. So I think you've kind of got some things going on the content side. And I think you'll see the same thing that will start happening on some of the networks. There's logical moves that boards are probably talking about. And my gut feel is that we'll be involved in some of those conversations over time. Whether anything make sense to our board? I have no idea.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","You said that you'd be less in the driver's seat I think that is the notion you were expressing there. Why would you be less involved with those decisions?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, we're probably not going out and buy Verizon or AT&T tomorrow. So those guys can do a lot more than we can do. They just have more flexibility in their balance sheet and they're just a lot larger. So I think the way we look at it is, we're really interested in what we can do, what we can control. We know that we control our own destiny for building out our network to meet our obligations to the FCC. We know that the things that we want to do to enhance shareholder value would be long term in nature, not short term in nature or we prefer to be long term in nature, not short term in nature.","And we have a vision of connectivity I think that includes \u2013 it's much broader than most people are thinking about today. And we think we have a lot of the building blocks that make that happen. And so, we think there's going to be like-minded people out there that want to get there the same way. And those are people you want to work with, and that could have absolutely no M&A activity. It could just be partnerships.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","But don't confuse the answer. Charlie wasn't saying that he personally wouldn't be in the driver's seat or involved in the decision-making.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Right. I don't think I'd ever get that mixed up. Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","All right.","Operator","And we'll go next to Anjali Athavaley with Reuters.","Anjali Athavaley - Reuters News Agency","Thanks for the question. Charlie, I wondered if you could address whether there have been talks with Amazon on potential involvement with the IoT network so far?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","No, I can't address that because we keep our conversations private. So you're certainly welcome to ask them. I think Roger can comment maybe a little bit on Amazon because we're doing a lot with them.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Sure. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of touchpoints between our businesses, including running some of our infrastructure in AWS to partnering with them on Fire TV and the things we do on the DBS side with Alexa integration and installing TVs. So there's quite a lot of touchpoints with Amazon across our organization.","Anjali Athavaley - Reuters News Agency","Got it. And just going back to the comment on the $500 billion companies that may want increasing control over connectivity. I mean, do you view that as something that could happen this year? Or is it more something 5 to 10 years out as 5G evolves?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","You'd have to ask them. And don't get me wrong, I think they have worked a lot at figuring out how to kind of build it organically. So I think they're going to be in the connectivity business. But Microsoft has just talked about white spaces. That's a different way to do connectivity than maybe some of the wireless incumbents or cable companies do it today.","Other people, we've seen drones and blooms and fiber builds and things like that. So they may want to grow that organically, right? But I think they have to be thinking strategically, and their boards have to be thinking strategically, about how you increase your connectivity.","And I can't remember what Facebook calls it. But Facebook, to grow over 2 million subscribers, they have to have connectivity. But they'd probably take a more worldly view. How do we connect people in Africa, and how do we connect people in Third World countries? And they'd probably look at that a little bit differently than maybe the way Facebook or Amazon would look at it, or Netflix would look at it. But they all have to look at it. And there's a lot of creative solutions out there.","Anjali Athavaley - Reuters News Agency","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Ryan Knutson with The Wall Street Journal.","Ryan Knutson - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I have one just clarifying point and then \u2013 first question is, with 600 megahertz, are you saying that you don't want to build anything? Or it's going to be really challenging to build anything until you get your hands on that network? I mean, how much does that handicap your ability to start building at least some elements of the network?","And then, secondly, can you talk a little bit about your preference or some of the different factors when it comes to either partnering with an existing operator to build a network versus build more on your own with tower operators and things like that?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","So, first and foremost, we are building the network and we're building the network using our E Block and AWS-4 spectrum, and we're doing that by the next 947 days, not that I'm counting.","Having said that, our dream would be to go to the tower one time and build out our spectrum in the 5G standard. That would be our dream, right? Because there's tremendous cost savings in doing that. And in fact to take it a step further you might go in conjunction when somebody else is building their network. So if AT&T was building their first network and you could go to the tower at the same time they go to the tower there might be some synergy in that, but the best synergy for us would be to put all of our network together at one time, go to the tower one time.","The problem we have is we have the build-out deadline from the FCC that says you have to have some of your spectrum in use by 2020. And the problem is the hardware for 5G is not ready, and our 600 megahertz spectrum is not ready, and our AWS-3 spectrum is still in litigation.","So it's hard to plan for those and we certainly don't want to build 4G network, and then the day we light it up, it's obsolete. And we got to go back six months later and convert it to 5G. That doesn't make any sense. And we don't want to climb the tower two and three times because every time you climb the tower it costs you thousands and thousands of dollars. You do it nationwide, it'd be billions of dollars.","So I think logically, what we've said is we'll have to do it in phases, maybe not our preference, but we'll get a lot of experience and we'll have a business in narrowband IoT and then phase II is to layer in full 5G connectivity on top of that.","And we won't even start planning in that network until we've got our IoT network planned, which should be totally planned by 2018. And then we can start thinking about phase II.","Ryan Knutson - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","And then, do you have a preference in terms of partnering with an existing operator? And also how much do that cause a struggle for you if you can't build out everything you want to do it first. I mean, it seems like that limits your options strategically.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I mean, that's what management is all about, which is you know where you want to go and you got to figure out how you got to get there. And again, I think we're going to try to do is this thing in two phases. It could be three phases, but preferably two phases. And first phase is what we've indicated to the market to the FCC, and I think people think that's logical.","And then I think the second phase is we've got a lot of spectrum we're going to put to use in the 5G, and I think there's going to be people who have like interest to see that spectrum in 5G and there may be opportunities to do that in a more efficient way than we can do by ourselves.","But if not, we will do it by ourselves, right? I mean, I never thought we're going to build a satellite I thought we're going to get somebody else to build satellites for us. And at the end of the day, we couldn't get anybody to build a satellite, so I think we're launching our 23rd satellite next month.","So, life goes in plenty of directions but that's what management is all about. And you have to have enough confidence in your team and enough confidence in your abilities that you have really good assets that you can turn into cash flow and do it in a smart and logical way.","And I think with technology, you got to be pretty open-minded. The technology go in directions you can't foresee. In my mind, have a way to how we do it, but I think it probably will vary a little bit over time.","R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp.","So, operator, we will leave it there. And thank you all for participating, and we'll probably talk to you in November.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"7207":["DISH Network Corp. (NASDAQ:DISH) Q4 2017 Earnings Call February 21, 2018 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Jason Kiser - DISH Network Corp.","Timothy A.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jason Kiser. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Kiser - DISH Network Corp.","Thanks, Michelle, and thanks, everybody, for joining us. I'm joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman; Tom Cullen, EVP of Corporate Development; Erik Carlson, our CEO. We also have Brian Neylon, President of DISH; Warren Schlichting, President of Sling; Steve Swain, our CFO; Paul Orban, our Controller; and Tim Messner, our General Counsel.","So, I know, Erik and Steve have some prepared remarks, but Tim is going to do our safe harbor disclosures.","Timothy A.

You should carefully consider the risks described in our reports and not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which we assume no responsibility for updating.","With that, I'll turn it over to Erik Carlson, our President and CEO.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Thank you, Tim. Welcome, everyone. We announced a new organizational structure at the end of last year, so I wanted to take a moment to review that. Then I'll make a few comments on our results, and I'll turn it over to Steve Swain, our CFO, who will go a little bit deeper on the financial results.","As you may recall, Charlie stepped away from the CEO role last December to dedicate himself day-to-day to the development of our Wireless business. And as Charlie shifted roles, I've been appointed President and CEO, so I thought I'd give you just a little bit of background on me. One is 23 years at DISH. I joined the company before we launched our first satellite, EchoStar I. I've been here for every DISH TV and Sling TV subscriber that we have served. And I've held various roles; sales, operations, including leadership in our in-home services department and customer care organizations. And most recently I served as President and COO, overseeing the company's day-to-day operations.","So as we're starting out to 2018, we'll look at the business through the following lens. Within our Pay TV business segment, we've got a mature business in DISH TV and we've got a growth business in Sling TV. And we've also got a future business in Wireless. So I'm going to speak for a few moments on Pay TV, and Charlie and Tom are both here to take any of your questions on Wireless.","So at DISH TV, as we've said over the years, satellite business is definitely a maturing business. We don't have the growth dynamics that we had in early years, but we still see some opportunity. We believe that DISH provides the best TV pay experience that you can get. We offer, no doubt, the best technology, best customer service, and the best value. And DISH TV is really the engine that's funding our future. So for 2017, we ended sitting just above 11 million DISH TV subscribers, and we spent really the last two and a half years improving our subscriber mix, really by focusing in on acquiring or retaining long-term profitable customers, despite the tough competition with both cord cutting and aggressive bundled offers.","The percent of newly acquired customers in our low competition or stable rural markets is definitely growing. And voluntary churn is down as we get back to our roots really, and focus in on adding rural customers. As well as we're equipping our front line and loyalty agents with more customer-centric save tactics.","In addition, higher quality new customers are driving non-paid churn to a multiyear low. Now we're committed to putting the customer first and delivering on superior technology, outstanding service at a great value. And we continue to challenge the sector through innovation. We've got the best DVR in the market with Hopper. We're the first major Pay TV provider to integrate with Netflix. We're the first to offer hands-free TV with Amazon Alexa. And by the way, coming later this year we'll be integrating the Hopper with the Google Assistant product.","All this really complements what we're doing with our newest Voice Remote control, which launched in November. And customers love voice control. Those customers that use the features have lower churn and definitely higher margin. Now on the service front, we ranked number one in customer service nationally by J.D. Power and our customers. And that's really a testament to our commitment through our frontline employees who are taking customer calls and who are installing DISH TV every day across the country.","And we've definitely been providing value to our customers through innovative programming packages. For example, we've got the ability now to right-size customers through skinnier packages like Flex Pack. And we're the only provider that offers the option to get locals over satellite or through an off-air antenna. With our technology, customers who have an antenna can easily receive free local programming and integrate that content right into their guide on the Hopper. It's a seamless experience that can help save the customer $12 a month.","Now looking over at our overall Pay TV segment, net Pay TV subscribers increased by approximately 39,000 in the fourth quarter. Now that includes 75,000 reactivations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands where we incurred certain expenses in connection with the reactivations of these returning subscribers following the devastation of Hurricane Maria.","I want to take a moment to thank our team in Puerto Rico who has really worked tirelessly to help get customers back up and running, even while looking out for their own families and friends in a very challenging environment. Our retail partners have worked long hours, and our DISH team members from the mainland have spent many weeks away from their families to help our customers return to service. We've also had team members assisting in the broad recovery effort as part of our DISH Cares corporate citizenship program. We've installed satellite broadband across the island, connecting hospitals, FEMA sites, pharmacies, emergency command centers. And I just have to say, I'm incredibly proud of the work that we're doing there and the effort that the team shows.","And just a few weeks ago we launched Sling TV on the island to help folks immediately get that new sports and entertainment that they may have been missing since the storms last fall. Let's take a moment and look at our growth business in Sling TV. No doubt you've taken notice of the fact that we've individually reported DISH TV and Sling TV subscribers within our Pay TV segment. Sling TV was the first and it remains the leading live and on-demand internet streaming service, and we're pleased with its growth.","Sling saw 47% year-over-year growth, closing 2017 with 2.2 million paid subscribers. And when Sling TV launched more than three years ago, we really set out to create a completely different model. Our vision was to give consumers more choice and control in how they watch TV and really set a new standard for the future of television. To give consumers the ability to customize their entertainment experience with things like optional add-on packages, optional cloud DVR and the option to get free broadcast locals with an antenna, even the option to come in and out of the service. So throughout 2017, we've seen steady improvements in our stability of the platform. This is translating to more engaged subscribers watching 27% more Sling per day. And, in fact, during the college football playoffs, we broke a Sling TV record for the greatest number of live concurrent customers using the platform.","With programming costs that continue to rise, we've been focused really on margin expansion in areas that we're better able to control. For instance, Sling TV ad sales has increased tenfold year-over-year, due to really pushing technology forward. And that leads to higher CPMs that really reflect the more targeted nature of the Sling TV service. Also, our customer-driven ARPU was up double digits, and this growth has been led by DVR penetration as well as our pay-per-view events and our programming add-ons.","Now one final item before I turn it over to Steve that really touches on the whole business, and I've mentioned putting a focus on the customer first and that leads to another one of our goals, which is really fielding the best team possible. And then to that end, I'd like to officially welcome our new Chief Human Resource Officer, David Scott, who joined our team earlier this month. He comes from Walmart where he served for 20-plus years in various HR leadership roles, and he'll continue to work to attract, retain and develop the best team to serve our customers.","With that summary, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Steve Swain, to briefly walk us through a few notes on the numbers.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","All right. Thank you, Erik. Looking at the P&L, 2017 revenue was $14.4 billion, down $821 million or 5.4% compared to 2016. This decline was driven by DISH TV subscriber losses, partially offset by Sling TV subscriber gains. ARPU pressure was also seen due to a higher mix of Sling TV customers as well as DISH TV cord shaving. Rate pressure was partially offset by a DBS price increase, an increased take rate of higher-priced Sling TV packages, and an increase in Sling TV's ad sales revenue.","While right-sizing initiatives may create short-term ARPU pressure, they offer a better, more disciplined long-term customer solution in comparison to simply offering loyalty credits. As Erik mentioned, because of this strategy, utilizing customer-friendly save tactics, as well as our focus on activating higher quality subscribers, we've seen DISH TV churn decrease to multiyear lows.","Turning to expenses, subscriber-related expenses were $8.9 billion, essentially flat year-over-year. This primarily is the result of fewer DISH TV subscribers, offset by significant programming rate increases. Our subscriber acquisition costs were $1.2 billion, decreasing $252 million or 17% compared to 2016. This decrease is primarily related to fewer DISH TV activations and lower costs per DBS activation, partially offset by increased marketing expenditures at Sling TV.","Selling and administrative expenses were $687 million, down $49 million or 6.6% year-over-year. This variance was primarily driven by favorable litigation settlements and fee reversals recorded early in 2017. At the end of 2017, we concluded that the carrying value of one of the satellites we acquired from TerreStar in 2012 exceeded its fair value. As a result of this assessment, we wrote down the net book value from $246 million to $100 million, and recorded an impairment charge of $146 million. This charge did not impact cash flow.","From an income tax perspective, due to tax reform, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities to the new 21% federal statutory rate. The re-measurement resulted in a noncash benefit of $1.2 billion and can be seen on the income tax line of the P&L. In 2017, we did not pay federal cash taxes, largely due to lower pre-tax income as well as the amortization of our spectrum licenses, including our newly-acquired 600 megahertz licenses. As we have mentioned in the past, spectrum is amortized for tax purposes but is considered an indefinite lived asset and not amortized for book purposes.","In 2018, changes resulting from tax reform, including limitations on the deductibility of interest, may increase cash tax paid for federal taxes. However, the ultimate impact of tax reform will depend on several variables, including our 2018 results and tax planning strategies.","Our free cash flow of $1.4 billion in 2017 remains strong. The year-over-year decline of approximately $122 million was primarily attributed to a decrease in EBITDA and an increase in cash interest payments associated with debt raised in 2016, partially offset by lower cash taxes and lower CapEx. We have a senior note maturity on April 1, 2018. The remaining debt balance on this maturity is approximately $1 billion. We expect to fund this obligation from cash. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $2 billion of cash and equivalents on hand.","In terms of the new revenue recognition standard, the first thing to note is that prior periods will not be recast. So as we report results in 2018 under the new standard, we will also show what 2018 would have looked like using the old standard.","We do not anticipate a significant change to our revenue. The biggest impact to us will be related to commissions costs which we currently expense as incurred through subscriber acquisition costs. But in the future, commissions will be capitalized and amortized over the estimated customer life. Therefore, 2018 costs will be lower than in previous periods. We expect commission expense will return to a steady state run rate in 2021.","Lastly, there will also be less significant impacts to other items such as upgrade fees and commercial contracts. Of course, all of these changes will be related to timing and classification and will not impact cash flows.","So with that, I think we're ready to open it up for questions from the analyst community. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Charlie, can you talk about the Wireless network, the progress so far on your plans, and the OpEx that's happened so far? And the drag that happened in 2016 versus 2017, as well as both CapEx and OpEx that we should expect in 2018? Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. I'll let Tom \u2013 probably Tom can answer a bit more than I do, so I'll let him answer that.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Hey, Phil. Yeah. We're making good steady progress on the network buildout. We've significantly enlarged the team and continue to add resources there. We've negotiated and executed many agreements from network equipment to towers to chipsets to deployment partners, so lots of activity in progress. Steve, I don't know the actual number in 2016 associated with Wireless.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","The change between 2016 and 2017, that variance is negligible.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Okay. But as you probably saw in the disclosure this morning, Phil, we're now estimating that we would spend up to $1 billion to complete this phase one of the network, which is as we filed last year in the first quarter to comply with the license requirements by March of 2020.","In the meantime, we continue to look at phase two of the network deployment which would be a broader use of the spectrum beyond narrow band IoT, and there's a few practical gating factors associated with that.","One is the 3GPP standard that was approved for 5G in December. That contemplates \u2013 that's what they call the non-standalone network. So understandably, the incumbent carriers prioritize that in the standards process, and that particular standard contemplates that you would have a 4G core to roll back to. Since we're a new entrant, we would be waiting for the standalone 5G standard, which is expected to be ratified later this year.","The second practical gating point associated with any phase two deployment is the availability of the 600 megahertz spectrum. Since the auction ended in 2016, the broadcasters have 39 months to clear, and so that clearance of all those licenses probably won't occur until early 2020.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Tom. And then the $1 billion, is that both CapEx and OpEx to March 2020?","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Yes.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","So we'll begin to incur that in 2018, clearly, and the bulk of it in 2019, and then some will fall into 2020.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Marci Ryvicker. Please go ahead.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Steve, can you just walk us through EBITDA for the fourth quarter? Because I think there are a bunch of different numbers out there just from an organic perspective. And maybe talk about what the EBITDA number is that you used for your leverage calculation. And then, there's a little bit of concern on how high your leverage is that you may have to tap the capital market at some point. Can you talk about how comfortable you are with whatever the height of your leverage target is? Thank you.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Sure. Okay. For the fourth quarter, Marci, what we look at is essentially OIBDA, which was about $600 million excluding the impact, the noncash impact of the asset impairment. So that's kind of the run rate number for the fourth quarter. As you and others have written, it is down on a year-over-year basis. As we look forward to 2018, we are projecting to bend that trend. As Erik mentioned, we have our strategic focus on acquiring and retaining higher-quality subs, even if that impacts the overall acquisition of fewer subs. The good news story was we are seeing proof points. We have a multiyear low in insurance which is helping our profitability. And another proof point is we just went through our price increase last month and those results were better-than-expected. So our acquiring and retaining higher-quality subscribers is working.","On the Sling side, Erik mentioned a couple things. We do see ARPU and margin expansion in 2018, so we'll see ARPU tailwinds coming from addressable advertising, as well as increased penetration on add-ons, such as DVRs. We look at \u2013 so that's EBITDA bending the trend. Wireless, Tom talked about that the \u2013 we're still in the planning phases and we'll start the $500 million to $1 billion spend in 2018 with the bulk in 2019. And with paying the debt April 1, we expect interest expense \u2013 cash interest expense to be down on a year-over-year basis, and I already talked about income taxes. So, if you add up all the pieces, the modeling should come out to a healthy free cash flow. We're certainly aware of our debt maturities, this one in 2018 as well as another one 18 months or so from now in 2019, and we are planning accordingly.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Is there a \u2013 do you have a leverage target or a high end that you just absolutely won't go above?","Jason Kiser - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, Marci. This is Jason. We really have never put out a leverage target. We're pretty comfortable with where we stand right now. We do plan to pay off, as Steve mentioned, the maturity that's coming up in April. We've got a pretty wide gap before the next maturity hits. We don't have any plans to go to the capital markets at present, but we have never, as a company, really put out a formal leverage target.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet of Citi. Please go ahead.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I just had a question on the quarterly EBITDA that you guys put up. Was there any impact from the 75,000 reactivations in Puerto Rico that was material that may have depressed the EBITDA in the quarter? Or is that not really a factor?","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","It wouldn't. It doesn't have a material impact to EBITDA. It was included in the subscriber acquisition costs and those 75,000 reactivations were below the average cost per add that DBS normally sees.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","On average.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. I had two questions I wanted to ask on the DE situation. First, I want to know if you could clarify whether or not the $400 million penalty, I think, it was 400, that you had paid at the DE case will be refunded given the court's decision? And also whether or not that is dependent on whether you come to a satisfactory remedy with the FCC. And then secondly, wondering how realistic it is that you might be able to come up with a remedy that would satisfy the FCC without overly diluting DISH's governance rights. In other words, is there any \u2013 is there a structure there that could work for you and the FCC? If there's any light you could shed on that or any comment, that'd be great. Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","This is Charlie. Bryan, we're certainly pleased that the court has remanded it back to the FCC, and we're hopeful that we can address the FCC's concerns. Obviously we don't believe we've ever controlled these entities, but the FCC has stated some concerns, and so we're pleased that we get to negotiate. We're not really as pleased about the process and public notice, and so forth, but at least we have a chance to address with the DEs their concerns. The penalty was not addressed, by the \u2013 I think, it's about $500 million, maybe a little more than that. I don't believe that was addressed by the court. We did ask the question. It wasn't addressed by the court. So I think that's still an open issue with the court. So there's about $3.3 billion of discounts at issue and potentially as much as a little over $500 million in penalties.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Good afternoon. Charlie, could you talk a little bit more \u2013 or Charlie or Tom \u2013 about what the network is going to look like at the end of the $1 billion or up to $1 billion in 2020? What is the service offering we should be expecting? What kind of coverage and product offerings that this build may bring to market? Any more color would be helpful. And then, just for Steve. Steve, you made a comment about cash taxes may be going up. I don't know if you can help us there at all. We all have our own EBITDA estimates, but what the right calculation may be on interest deductibility so we can think through the implications there. And then, related, or related at least to Steve, any help on how much of the subscriber acquisition costs last year were represented by commissions, so we can think about the benefit you're going to get in 2018 and beyond from capitalizing and amortizing those costs? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","This is Charlie, and maybe Tom will want to jump in. But the network, as we talked about it and disclosed to the FCC last year, is a narrowband IoT network. It'll cover 70% of the population at a minimum across the country, and obviously after we came out with a narrowband IoT network, you've seen major communication companies around the world and the United States also declare their intentions for narrowband IoT. So the connectivity side of where the world is going is being recognized by people at all levels.","Obviously it's the first step in our networks. It's not \u2013 we're only cleared \u2013 the DE situation has, because it's not resolved yet, is another factor that kind of ties our hands a little bit because we obviously don't control that spectrum today. So we have \u2013 our uplink spectrum is probably not the ideal spectrum we'd like to use in a network. And then, obviously, 5G standards, product for 5G standards, will come on to the marketplace not in time for us to deploy the broader network in phase two that we'd like to. So, we've built a great team, we've got a really passionate group of people here.","Obviously, my day-to-day focus now is on that network, but not just that network, it's all the things that go along, and satellite play is a component part of it as well. Video play is a part of it. So we're well-versed in what we think the next generation of networks should look like. Like anything else, the foundation will be that narrowband IoT network, but that's really just a small part of where we'll go with that network in terms of total 5G network.","So I think short answer is it will cover at least 70% of the country. It will connect to those devices that don't need \u2013 it's not going to connect to a jet engine off an airplane that downloads a lot of data, but it will connect to people and sensors and microprocessors where it can fit within frameworks of data rates, and that's a \u2013 you just, every day, you start reading about all the growing applications for that.","As an example, we went out and we acquired a company called ParkiFi, an IoT company that was a leader in the parking space in terms of parking meters and parking and so forth, and so that has rolled into some of the things that we're doing in terms of where we could go beyond parking and applications in cities and municipalities and things like that. So we've got some \u2013 we've added some expertise to our team that's done IoT, and had real business and real customers. So it's a bit new to us. It's like, it reminds me a little bit when we decided to build satellites in 1990, we never built a satellite, so. We got there because we've got a great dedicated team who is passionate about doing it, and we put our hearts and souls into doing it, and that's what we're doing with Wireless.","Tom, do you want add anything on that?","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Yes. Ben, just a couple of clarifications. The 70% requirement, we will be, the plan is to provide terrestrial signal coverage to 70% of the population in each of the 176 license areas, and so it's not on a U.S. population basis. As far as product and services development, that's still work in progress.","As Charlie said, we see several \u2013 there's consumer applications, clearly, but there are also enterprise\/commercial verticals, as well as municipalities. We're encouraged by the activity, actually, globally. You're seeing quite a bit in Asia and Europe around narrowband IoT, and so we'll be monitoring what applications and services are succeeding elsewhere and, as I said earlier, we've already executed agreements for chipsets and modules, and so now we're looking at end user devices and business, specific business cases.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you, guys.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, Steve \u2013 I think that, Steve had a couple of questions...","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Good morning, Ben.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","So cash taxes, we're not really giving a specific number on that. We'll have an update after Q1. And then as far as rev rec impact, specifically, commissions, we don't give guidance on EBITDA, and giving you kind of the impact to EBITDA from rev rec is, because we don't give guidance on EBITDA, it's a little circular. I can say that it is a good guide, as I mentioned, and it's going to be less than 5% of EBITDA. But as I mentioned in the first quarter, you'll see 2018 results under the new standard, as well as the old standard. So you'll be able to see all the changes. But it's, A, it's good guide; and B, it should be relatively small net impact to EBITDA of commissions and all the other line items on that measure.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Walter Piecyk of BTIG. Please go ahead.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Hi. It's Rich Greenfield. Walt is reconnecting with nature somewhere and will be back on the next call. But a couple of questions, all on your \u2013 on the video side of the business. So DISH has been able to keep the cost of programming down by kind of separating Disney and Fox content, so it's not in all of their packages. Do you think that's going to be sustainable in light of the in-process merger between Disney and Fox?","Two; Sling, nor really any of the vMVPDs that you now compete against, other than for adding channels, none of them have raised price. So your programming costs, I assume, keep rising, yet your retail pricing has all remained the same. Is that sustainable? And then just quickly on housekeeping, I just want to make sure that the Sling numbers that you've started reporting, that actually includes all the international-only subscribers that actually predated the launch of what we now call Sling in early 2015. Thanks so much.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, Rich. I'll try to take a stab at that. Well, obviously, we'll have concerns. We'll, obviously, have concerns about Disney, Fox, and so forth. And, obviously, consumers would like to pick and choose what they watch. And, obviously, the nature of the beast today is not quite that way for anybody in the marketplace.","And then, you've got, obviously, the AT&T-Time Warner merger. So I think the landscape will potentially can change one way or the other over the next 12 months, and we built our company to be able to adapt to that. We don't make the \u2013 we're not big-enough company to make the rules in Washington, and we are subject to the courts like everybody else. So we've been around long enough to know we're going to have to be able to be adaptive to that and make sure that we plan for these kind of contingencies to the best you can, and I think, we're as well-positioned as anybody can be in that.","There's nothing new on the video business, other than what we've been saying for the last five years, which is the video business is going to change. And I think that we're probably the first guys in the industry to take a real hard look at the profitability of customers and adjust accordingly, and not try to be \u2013 not try to have a number for a quarter and make sure we spend our money where we could get a return and we saw the world going to connectivity and video being a big part of that and had the opportunity to acquire spectrum.","We're the largest acquirer of spectrum in the last three \u2013 when you take the last three auctions, and that's where we put our capital, and our biggest bet that we've ever made, and we think we're going to be a major player in that. And if not, then connectivity is not going to be a business. And, again, we haven't made a lot of big bets, but with good bets, we've been pretty confident and when we've made them we've gone all-in and we're certainly all-in, and we think we have an ability to come here with a kind of clean sheet of paper, and we spent a lot of time talking to people about what they'd want to see in a new clean sheet of paper 5G network.","We have a pretty good feel for what that should look like. We think that looks a little different than what some of the other guys are doing. We think that that's going to add to productivity, and the health and welfare of this country and make it more competitive, and we think it's going to be profitable for us.","And so video business isn't going away, and Erik and his team are managing a mature business the way you should manage a mature business, and not in a unhealthy \u2013 in a healthy way, and it's still a very well cash business. I think, you can extract out that as the industry declines in the linear TV business, that there's consolidation opportunities, where you are going to need to be more efficient, and you're going to need to cut costs, and I think, those thing \u2013 and regulatory rules will change. And so, I think, you can see a lot of different things that will probably come about in the future. So I think \u2013 I don't think anything \u2013 I don't think there's anything that's happened that we haven't kind of internally projected over the last five years. And I think we've positioned ourselves well for those changes that are going to come and we've been a bit ahead of the curve on most things, and that we're certainly ahead of the curve on the connectivity.","What was the other question? I don't remember.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Well, Rich, maybe \u2013 this is Erik. Maybe just on the international customers, just on our Sling subscribers, I mean, we're looking at paid subscribers and we have, obviously, a number of different services, right, so you could take Orange from us, you could take Blue, you could take Orange and Blue, plus international. For example, if you took Orange plus Blue plus international, that would count as one subscriber for us.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And the short answer is the 2.2 million \u2013 in the 2.2 million subscribers are some international-only customers.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","That was the question.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","That's right.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","And then, Charlie, thank you for that clarification. But just to follow up on what you just said about the DTV, or sorry, the AT&T-Time Warner transaction, the government clearly shares your view. That's going to head to court next month. Obviously, we'll all see where that ends up. But if the government sees the consumer being harmed by that transaction, do you think \u2013 how does DISH think about the Disney-Fox deal? And should the government view that the same way as they view the AT&T-Time Warner deal?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I mean, I think I've been around long enough to know that each transaction is different and that the government will handle them differently. But to the extent that there's similarities between Disney-Fox, and I would argue that there are then those should be treated consistently. In my experience with the Justice Department, in particular, is that's typically the case.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. A quick modeling question, and then a bigger picture question. The modeling question is, if we look at some of the new segment disclosure you provided, including visibility into the Wireless P&L, looks like there was about $162 million EBITDA drag in Wireless in 2017. I was hoping you could clarify whether the AWS-4 satellite impairment charge is included in that.","And then the bigger picture question. Charlie, when we talk with investors about 5G, and really when you read about 5G, it's almost exclusively a discussion about spectrum bands over 3 gigahertz. And your portfolio is substantially below that. And I think there's a view that that's kind of what the 5G playing field is built around. So I was hoping we could maybe just take a moment and step back and you could talk a bit about how you see your wireless assets, your spectrum resources, fitting into the broader 5G ecosystem. And whether you think it is important for you to identify scale in even higher frequencies either by acquiring it or working with a partner or something along those lines. Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","You want to take...","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. The first one, yes. The $146 million impairment did hit the Wireless segment.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Noncash.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And then, Brett, on the 5G question, it's a good question. First of all, I'd say as a general statement, much of the 5G talk is confusing, misinformed, and inaccurate and spin-worthy. But within that, there is, obviously, lots of good information that is very accurate. And the first, the 5G has initially been focused on the higher end spectrum, even in the millimeter wave technology because you can take advantage of some of the things that 5G offers in terms of mass and MIMO and things like that. And it was the spectrum frontiers, the efforts on the FCC part, which I would congratulate the FCC on that to bring more spectrum to United States. They've really done a pretty fantastic job of that.","In terms of, that's been their focus. But having said that, you're going to see that 5G impacts all levels of spectrum, starting as low as 600 megahertz. And T-Mobile has made up, as will we, to make sure that as our network we believe that 5G will be in our bands of our spectrum. We don't \u2013 we do own about \u2013 most of the top 50 markets in millimeter wave technology and the 12.2 to 12.7 GHz technology. We've asked the FCC \u2013 we've actually gone to the previous administration to look at that. Chairman Wheeler didn't quite get it in the spectrum frontier side of it.","But there's about 500 megahertz of terrestrial spectrum that we believe could be put into use pretty much right away that we own a significant proportion of it, but there's others that own it as well. And we're hopeful that this administration will and Chairman Pai in particular because he's so focused on bringing additional spectrum, would take a look at that and get that on \u2013 get a rule making for that to bring that into use. Because that could come into use before just about any other kind of spectrum that they're looking at.","So we do have some of that. We do own some 28 gig spectrum in four states as well. So we've thought about millimeter. We think it's a bit more in the fixed wireless, at least initially. There's a little less knowledge about whether we can make that in terms of mobility use. But I think that, like anything else, everything that \u2013 that the data demands of where we're going as a country and a population continue to increase, the technology gets better. The technology gets better, the efficiency gets better, the new bands come. But we need all those resources to meet up with. We haven't seen an effective artificial intelligence and virtual reality and changes to our health care in the United States. We haven't seen those things come online yet. And autonomous vehicles, just tremendous amounts of data. So we need all the \u2013 we need every resource to play a part.","The other thing I'd say in 5G, at least the way we look at it is, there's a bunch of things beyond 5G per se in terms of technologies that we think that when you start with a clean sheet of paper you \u2013 big improvements, notwithstanding the latency improvements you can make. But there's things like virtual networks. When you start going to your core networks being virtualized and all the things you can do and the cost efficiencies and efficiencies with your network, when you think about, then that's a huge difference. AT&T is kind of leading the way on that today, but we certainly believe that our network will be virtual from day one. The entire network virtual from day one, as an example. There's things that you can \u2013 where you can slice your network so that multiple people could have access to your network almost as if they own their own network. That's not in anybody's networks today.","So there's things in security. When you start thinking about IoT and things that we can do in security that were never thought of in existing networks today, maybe make that network a bit more secure for customers or making sure that somebody doesn't have use of your data that you don't want to. So a lot of different things that we can do that are beyond the 5G side that make a clean sheet of paper network just that much more efficient and the cost per bit that much less than where people are today.","It's a little \u2013 again, my analogy just is the world today is prop planes, and we just invented the jet engine, and we get to start an airline with jet engines. Doesn't mean the other guys don't have jet engines, but they don't want to write off all the prop planes they own, and so it's going to take them a number of years to wean those prop planes out of their fleet. We get to start with all 737s like Southwest Airlines and maintenance costs are down and cost per mile is down and safety is better, and it's the same thing.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","If you don't mind, apologies, you talk about the clean sheet and the efficiency. It would seem like that would be most appealing to somebody who is not presently in the space. I mean, they would get all the efficiency and none of the legacy. Have you continued to talk to companies outside of your traditional wireless space? Do you think there's a real appetite to partner with DISH as you build out that clean sheet of paper network?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I believe that that clean sheet of paper approach is attractive to people outside of the industry who maybe have huge data needs in their future. When their planning people are looking at their data needs and they look at that, you can think of some companies that might be in that situation. I think it's also attractive to people who are in this space where particularly as you get below 3 gig, in answer to the other question, I forgot to say, they have to re-farm their spectrum. And so that's changing the tires as the car's moving down the road. That's a little bit more difficult to do. So for those companies potentially a clean sheet of paper would allow them to enter with a hybrid network of 5G and 4G without having to go through the inefficiencies of farming their \u2013 an artificial deadline to re-farm their network. So I think our network is appealing to any number of companies, both in the business today and outside the business today.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Operator, we'll take one more question before we move to the media.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our final question from the analyst community. We will begin the media portion of this call following the answer to this final analyst question. Our final analyst question comes from Lee Cooperman of Omega Advisors. Please go ahead.","Leon G. Cooperman - Omega Advisors, Inc.","Wow, made it just in under the wire. I have two questions directed to Charlie, really. First, you have more skin in the game than anybody. You have a mixture of businesses that are growth businesses, deteriorating businesses, sunrise, sunset, whatever. I'm just curious, as you and your team are hard at work, do you believe that we are creating value that those of us that are patient and wait for the long-term that you're going to have creating value here, rather than being part of a business that's deteriorating. That's question one.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, okay. What was the second part?","Leon G. Cooperman - Omega Advisors, Inc.","And then question number two is, very hypothetical. Justice is going after the AT&T-Time Warner deal. I have no idea what Time Warner wants to do or not do, but if in the event they were willing to divest DIRECTV to get a deal done, do you think the Justice Department would allow you to combine with DIRECTV?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Your second question is pretty easy. I think that today you could combine DISH and DIRECTV. And the reason I say that is when tried to do that 10 years ago or 12 years ago that was really going from three to two in terms of the marketplace, and so you start to bust out a lot of indexes. But today you're already close to double digits in terms of people who have MVDD-type products to the consumer. So there's a lot of choice. So maybe you're going from 10 to nine. So it's a different analysis. And the second thing is, back in those days, the DBS business was growing quite rapidly. As you mentioned, it is suffering from some deterioration today. So I think the marketplace is a little bit different. So I think that Justice would look at that positively, but that's my opinion and I have no inside information on that.","As far as value, I can tell you every day we come into work, I can tell you as an executive and a personal shareholder here that our focus is building long-term value every day. And we don't have a scoreboard. When we walk in our office, we don't have our stock price. We have a countdown clock that tells us how many days we have to build out our network. So we're focused on building value every day. And I can assure you that at least it's my belief, and I think that our management team and our employee's team thing is that we believe we're building value every day. And sometimes value doesn't get \u2013 you can't prove it, you can't touch it, you can't feel it for a while. It goes a bit in stair steps, but eventually that value gets recognized. So we built satellites for 3.5 years before we launched one and not one person gave us any value for building those satellites until they were up and operational. Then all of a sudden we had value.","And then we have hidden values in this company that our management team is challenged, so Erik and his team are really challenged, which is we have a nationwide installation network that can touch \u2013 with a dispatch system that can be in somebody's home and climb on their roof and do some pretty complicated things, and we can grow that business. We have scale in programming. We have relationships with content providers that most people don't have, and that has value because we understand that business and how it works and how that can be a growing business both in current technology and future technology. And we're one of the few companies that touch satellite, video, and wireless connectivity. So I'm confident that we're building a lot of value. I have no idea whether that's reflected or not reflected in our stock price, Lee, but we're building value.","Leon G. Cooperman - Omega Advisors, Inc.","Okay. Well, good luck, and thank you for your hard work and your team's hard work. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take questions from members of the media. Our first media question comes from Scott Moritz from Bloomberg. Please go ahead.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg LP","Yeah, great. Thanks. I think someone has already won the M&A question betting pool, but I just hope that Charlie was forced to pay more than $1 on this one, referring, of course, to last call. But the...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Are there any other questions on the betting pool that I can help you with permission?","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg LP","I will add on to the M&A question, though. Things, as you plan this narrowband network in 5G, I'm just wondering if your conversations have moved beyond the usual cast of potential partners, M&A partners in particular? And if you have any specifics on that, I'd love to get it.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","As you might imagine, Scott, I wouldn't comment on any discussions that we may or may not have.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg LP","Thank you.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","By the way, I give the same answer to my kids if they complain about it, too.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Shalini \u2013 I'm sorry, from Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Hey, guys. A quick question on \u2013 I noticed that Sling growth seemed to have slowed year-over-year and I was curious what would you say the number one reason is that Sling TV subscribers disconnect?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","And, Warren, you'll probably get that.","Warren Schlichting - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","But before that, Shalini, congratulations on the baby.","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Thank you.","Warren Schlichting - DISH Network Corp.","Hey, Shalini, it's Warren. So we had 47% year-over-year growth. We like that. We like our position. I guess, I'd just answer the question with we have a different model. We have a unique model, and so we're not out there with fancy promos and giving the service away. We've been at this a while. We think we know what consumers want, and I think we like our position.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","But I might add to that. I mean a lot of people churn off of OTT. I think one of the big factors that I don't think is recognized totally by everyone is it is somewhat seasonal. So if you can buy a sports \u2013 March Madness is coming up. Somebody could get to particularly a free offer, you might be able to get a free offer. Watch it and churn off and you buy one month and churn off. So one-month churn is particularly high in the industry because people come in and out as a matter of convenience and can move around.","The second thing is as there's a number people with free offers and free hardware offers or free offers or discounted offers, you can move from player to player to player. And in theory you could probably go \u2013 I'm sure there are some college kids who are going a year and never paying a dime for multichannel TV and getting lifetime HBO from AT&T. People will get smarter about how they do that and there'll be some discipline. People aren't suicidal out there in a capitalist society, so there'll be some discipline. You saw that I think one of them raised their price, adds a couple of channels and raised their price. I think Sony has raised their price, and so we're starting to see a little bit more discipline maybe.","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Will you guys stop allowing to disconnect after one month, or is there any plans to change that?","Warren Schlichting - DISH Network Corp.","No current plans. We like where we are. We feel like we've \u2013 it really puts the onus on us to provide value. And I would throw out, by the way, that we see the demographics broadening. And so with that, I think, comes an expectation that the service works, that it's stable. So we focused a lot on providing a good, stable, consistent service, and I think we're being rewarded for it.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And, by the way, Shalini, we're working with programmers to look at some of that, as we have kind of data across the platform to say, one of the things we can do to have meaningful programs throughout the year on a particular network or a particular combination of networks. And so to the extent that programmers will work with us, sometimes they have their own ideas and maybe our opinions aren't as relevant. But to the extent that they'll work with us, I think we have meaningful ideas and meaningful creative things that can really help the programmers in terms of \u2013 we both have a motivation to reduce the short-term churn within the platform. And so there's things that we can do proactively together. We can't do them unilaterally, but with the programmers' help I think there's things we can do.","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Operator, we have time for one more media question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Dano of FierceWireless. Please go ahead.","Mike Dano - FierceMarkets, Inc.","Yes. Thank you very much for taking my call. I appreciate it. I wanted to ask a little bit about the NB-IoT network that you're building out. I wanted to know what spectrum bands you're currently building out and then also whether you would still be able to sell spectrum if such a transaction occurred, whether this would sort of tie up all that spectrum in a build-out.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Hi, Mike. This is Tom. The specific configurations of the radios we have not publicly discussed, but we will be meeting the build-out requirements for both AWS-4 and the 700 E Block, and I don't think the deployment of this network would foreclose any future opportunities for us.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Even during the build-out for this spectrum.","Mike Dano - FierceMarkets, Inc.","Right.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Okay. Everyone, thank you for your time and participation, and we'll look forward to catching up after the next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

Your line is open.","Marci Ryvicker","I have two questions, first, related to spectrum and then second to the core business. Charlie, not that I think that this will happen but should the FCC find you violating some rule with regards to the designated entities that were used in AWS-3 auction. I guess first of all how do you think about the $3 billion and does that concern you at all? And then secondly I would assume if you had to pay the 3 billion that the restrictions that the designated entities have with that spectrum go away so then you have free and clear use of AWS-3. And then the second question is more related to the core business, now with Joe Clayton gone and you are back in the CEO, are there any priorities that are different at this point. How do you think about deploying capital to the Pay-TV business? Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","Okay this is Charlie Ergen and I'll probably take just first shot at both of those and then may be somebody will jump in on the core business, but on the auction all I can say is that I'm confident that DISH and the DEs followed the rules of the auction and I do not think there that the discount -- I think the discount will be allowed. And so I think you are correct that if you don't get a DE discount the encumbrance fall away, I mean obviously DEs get a discount for a couple of reasons, one is the encouragement by the Federal Government, Congress and the FCC who've passed these rules, were economic development and the second is that the DEs have restrictions on their spectrum, so it's less valuable so therefore it's a discount and obviously they can't lease more than 25% of the spectrum, an entity for five years, they can't sell the spectrum without a penalty, so that devalues the spectrum to DE. And it's probably one of the reasons that maybe some of the bigger players didn\u2019t use DEs because of the restriction on leasing, because they would like to deploy that capital, I mean that spectrum into their networks immediately and where they've used DEs in the past in this option they did not.","As far as the core business, I probably do look at things a little different than Joe. I'm certainly going through a review, I look at it economically and long-term so I look at the value of a customer and when you make an investment in a customer you can get return on that capital, not all customers are created equal. Certainly I see room for improvement in terms of how we allocate capital to customers and we've really gone along two different fronts. One is, I think there's room for improvement on our -- in terms of getting a better credit customer and a customer that we believe will stay with us longer term and do not escape, some of our parts are pretty sophisticated so I think it's a bit of rightsizing for us in terms of making sure that we're getting this more sophisticated customers, the sophisticated equipment and maybe a little simpler equipment too, to some of our customers and I think that the, and there'll be some questions on this later. So I'll just try to be brief but I think Sling TV adds a total different dimension because there the economics are much different, the cost of churn is very low the cost of the acquisition is very low. Those customers have different set of economics than a linear, core customer that we have today, and we want to take advantage of some of those things.","So this is not as dramatic, perhaps what Netflix went through, but Netflix when they looked at, and so I'm not trying to insinuate that this is anything, like this dramatic, but it's somewhat similar in the sense that when Netflix went from a DVD business in the mail to being able to deliver something to people you know instantly through the Internet you know they started focusing on that side of the business because they knew long-term that that was going to capture more of the public. Now I'm not saying that's going to happen here but I do think that things like Sling TV are going to become more and more prevalent in the business and the way you deploy capital will be different as a result of that. So I think I probably do have, I think that fundamentally is going kind of top down and looking at those things.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan, your line is open.","Phil Cusick","Charlie can you talk about just the difference between the collusion that some have talked about you being charged with and the coordinated bidding that you did with your Des? Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","Yes, I'm not an attorney so let me just, I think we got, I think we've been accused of -- I can only say that DISH and to my knowledge the DEs followed the rules, they did not violate any FCC rule for the auction, did not violate any antitrust law and that the procedures of, the FCC has a procedure to go through and verify that, and then they should do that and that's a procedure that's been out there for 20 years as long as the DE program has been out there. So there will be people will be able to replay to the DE\u2019s application by tonight, or by today and then by early next week I think on Monday or Tuesday the DEs, and probably DISH will have replay comments to that and then by the 26th of May will be replays to our replay until next week we will replay to any formal thing that people file in opposition which I am sure there will some opposition then we\u2019ll follow comments to that. But I can assure that DISH and the Des followed the rules and did what the rules -- and only participated in this auction the way that rules allowed.","Phil Cusick","May be if I can try a different one. Can you -- I understand it\u2019s a little early on Sling to be giving your subscriber counts, but can you give us an idea of sort of order of the magnitude of paying customers today maybe 10s or 100s of 1000s is that measured in?","Charlie Ergen","I think and Roger may want to jump in I think look the results are encouraging, it\u2019s a brand new thing I mean the people -- it eliminates some pain points for customers it is on track and it is instant gratification and it works on existing devices for a lot of people. So we\u2019re really encouraged with it. We think that it has -- we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a flash in the pan. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a -- we think it\u2019s long-term that IPTV is here to stay. Obviously Sony is rolling out a different strategy, CBS is rolling out of strategy, HBO is rolling out a strategy so we\u2019re going to see more and more of it and we\u2019re hopeful that DISH and Sling TV will be a leader there. We have our work cut out force I mean it\u2019s a much more complicated due to live TV than just a stream TV. We are in multiple devices in different makes and models with different processors so within the same device there is different processors and generations, we have got multiple programmers that have different rules. So we have some inconsistencies in the rules with our customers, which is a little bit frustrating for our customers and we are not as good as we need to be technically.","So on the other hand, again you can go and read the reviews of the product for yourself but for the vast majority of people they love it and they\u2019re really excited and they are for the vast majority our new entrants into the business and people who weren\u2019t paying for television before and so we\u2019re excited about where it\u2019s going to go and I think it\u2019s going to be meaningful revenue for DISH. We had to scale it. And I think it would be not only meaningful revenue but I think it would be meaningful value to the Company. I don\u2019t know Roger, do you want maybe add something there?","Roger Lynch","Yes, just when we launched it we really had three categories of customers we were going after. First and foremost was cord nevers which tend to be millennial and second was cord cutters, and when we talk about cord cutters we\u2019re talking about people that may have cut the cord two or three years ago as well as the ones cutting the cord today. And the final is supplementars which are people who have traditional Pay-TV will take Sling TV on top of it and those are sort in order of how we thought about, how we\u2019d get subscribers and that\u2019s really borne out. So we\u2019re seeing momentum across all three of those categories with our main focus being cord nevers but increasingly as cord cutting continues we\u2019ll see more and more coming from that category. And it wasn\u2019t surprising to us but maybe surprising to many people, there are people who have traditional Pay-TV and will buy Sling TV on top of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Moffett","Charlie I wonder if you could just reflect on the health of the traditional video business for a moment and you talked about I guess it was a couple of years ago your kids thinking you were crazy to be in video, I know your own subscriber losses were attributable impart to system programming agreement disputes but those subscribers didn\u2019t show up anywhere else in the industry, how much do you feel like we\u2019re sort of seeing the decline of the sector, and is that happening sooner or more slowly than you would have expected. And then a related question on Sling if I could and that is you once said before that the idea of skinny sports bundles without regional sports but with ESPN probably didn\u2019t make a lot of sense for you in the linear business but something must have changed in that that\u2019s sort of where you are with Sling, can you talk about the role of regional sports in the Sling packages if you would?","Charlie Ergen","First I would quite disagree with you I think the losses and subs that we had probably did go to the other players I think one of the reasons I think that Direct TV would probably privately tell you they got a fair share of some of those customers we know they wouldn\u2019t make it Viacom\u2019s down the past for example we got calls from people we never got calls from before so we know that it translated to probably just some cable companies and certainly to Direct TV so I think they\u2019d probably the best, people didn\u2019t stop watching Fox News or CNN or Turner we had kind of back-to-back takedowns of major programmers and those people didn\u2019t -- almost 100% of those people didn\u2019t quit watching TV and if you\u2019re a Fox News guy the only place you really can get it is on linear TV there is really none other avenue for it. So I think [Multiple Speakers].","Craig Moffett","No I didn\u2019t mean that literally I just meant the sector had its weakest first quarter ever and actually contracted for the first time in the first quarter?","Charlie Ergen","Yes and so then it leads the kind of the health of the industry I think it\u2019s probably I think look it\u2019s mature and if you look at the -- again I don\u2019t have every piece of data that every content owner has or our competitors have but my general sense is that the linear pay television business probably peaked a couple of years ago and that it\u2019s in a very slight decline in terms of number of households that will pay for the big bundle but I don\u2019t see it and it\u2019s not declining as fast as I would have thought it would and so there is -- and the bundle was here for the vast majority of people still the best economic value. And I think that there is creative things being done to continue to make sure that people have good products you see what Verizon is doing to give customers a bit more choice we\u2019ve been doing that for a long time. I think people are going to have products for customers that satisfies their need without having them having to leave the bundle.","But I think it\u2019s -- the world is changing and I think I have said it for a long time the younger -- we're missing the generation in pay television and what\u2019s really nice about Sling TV and kind of the second part of the question is that we\u2019re really taking an approach with Sling TV where we had some visions of how we might do it, it ended up being that not all programmers wanted to work with us or weren\u2019t willing to work with us at the time and so we\u2019re really working with the core programmers that we have and the discussion is more about how do we build our business together because almost all Sling television customers are incremental customers for our content partners. And so the discussions are much different than they are in -- if we\u2019re talking about Fox, Fox News they want us to pay a penny more and we want to pay penny less and that\u2019s the extent of the discussion.","With Sling TV it\u2019s a bit more about how do we get more customers who aren\u2019t paying for television now, what kind of bundle would it look like, should we do things like pause or look back or should we let me have a network DVR should we -- how do we do advertising, how do we get customers to look at multiple devices, how do we get more minutes from the customer, how do we do data so we know how do we share data so we know better how to serve the customers. Those are conversations where both parties win it\u2019s not a zero some gain and so the admin of Sling TV is probably going to go more the direction of content partners who want to participate within the kind of guidelines that we have today versus whether it\u2019s regional sports or sports.","In other words we\u2019d love to have regional sports and Sling Television but I don\u2019t know that you can burden every single customer with the regional sports network when the vast majority of them don\u2019t watch it and it\u2019s very expensive. So, on the other hand the regional sport providers all incremental business to that regional sports provider. So, they had to look at it and decide whether that\u2019s a place they want to go and if they want to go that route I think Sling Television is a great platform to get them there.","Craig Moffett","Are you concerned that the cost of the EPSN and base bundle sort of makes it so that it\u2019s really only sport fans that are going to be very interested but that sports fans also want regional?","Charlie Ergen","I guess what I would say and make a general statement is that probably within a household a vast majority of people watch ESPN, they may not all watch it every day but the vast majority of the household watches ESPN, I don\u2019t think the vast majority of the household watches regional sports. So I think they are two different animals and of course with ESPN comes Disney and a lot of other channels. So I think that it would be difficult to do any kind of bundle without ESPN. I think that\u2019s not the case with regional sports.","ESPN goes across all really goes -- they just have too many events people are going to watch a National Championship football game there is too many they are going to watch the SEC network. The nine states in the south there is no body then watch SEC football. There is people who don\u2019t watch the regional sports network from Tampa. And we have real data on what our customers watch and I think this isn\u2019t Neilson data I mean we have years, and years and years of experience with customers. And ESPN is a valued partner, Disney is a valued partner. They are the company that took a chance on Sling TV and so they\u2019re just invaluable in terms of putting that together.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ben Swinburne","I wanted to ask Charlie about the quarter again. How much of the results are related, do you think, to the Fox dispute versus execution? Did any of your competitors actively market the fact that you had lost programming against you in the quarter? Because I noticed the connects were down quite a bit. I'm trying to figure out if that's a piece of what drove that year-over-year decline?","Charlie Ergen","Bernie may want to follow-up on that I will just make a general statement I would say the decline, I would say there is probably three big buckets, one I think the biggest bucket would be that not just Fox but the fact when you take something down there is tail on it several months while customers have decided to leave you and they are still waiting on installation from somebody else even when you bring the programming back. So started really last November and went through kind of mid-January with takedowns so that went on really throughout the quarter although they had tailed off by the end of the quarter. I don\u2019t know that our competitors are actively started to run. And we have Fox TV as with Fox certainly it ran ads more and then certainly connected them and if you are a satellite guy, you know there is another guy called Direct TV out there. So I think everybody else somewhat benefited from that. And Fox is one of the few stations that you don\u2019t to take down but the deal just didn\u2019t make any sense for us and we were prepared to live without Fox and we had lived without Fox we\u2019d lost more customers but we would have gained customers\u2019 long-term because of the cost savings. So we\u2019re certainly prepared to do that.","The second bucket would be that I\u2019m looking at the credit scores in an overall economic and I think we\u2019re probably a little less aggressive today than perhaps when Joe was here because I\u2019m looking at to gain a customer long-term and I\u2019m trying to get a customer to make a bonus or get a customer to show to Wall Street because I\u2019m very confident in where we are going. So I don\u2019t need to play to do that. And the third thing is that we are in a transition to APSK modulation scheme which essentially gives us kind of 50% more capacity on our more satellites and we have MPEG2. We have only MPEG4 on our eastern satellite but our western satellites have MPEG2, but they have the ability their APSK modulation on that satellite but we still have MPEG2 only boxes out there that don\u2019t have APSK and so we\u2019re in the middle of a transition or transitioning those customers out and as we transition those customers out there are times either when we touch the customer and we lose them because we don\u2019t touch them correctly or we touch the customer and we lose them because it is a vacation home or it is a customer that hasn\u2019t been paying us so we decide or he calls too many times or he is just not a real good customer for us it\u2019s economical and we may touch the customer out of our system.","And so that is going to continue on through the end of this quarter before we do that. The benefit of that is we pick up about 30% of the satellite in additional capacity. So it\u2019s a very meaningful transition for us to pick up a lot of capacity then we can obviously generate more revenue with going forward and have a more modern subscriber base out there than we do today and of course all providers have that problem on set top boxes when you have set top boxes that are 7, 8, 9,10 years old out there your whole system can\u2019t move as fast, and Bernie do you want to add to that?","Bernie Han","Yes just add to what Charlie said on the churn side in the quarter most of the variance of churn versus prior first quarters I think was the impact of takedowns and in the case of churn the tail on the takedowns is shorter compared to the acquisition side so we think most of the impact from the takedowns that we saw or potential takedowns we saw have run itself through the first quarter with respect to cord cutting as Charlie alluded to the effect of cord cutting has been much less than any of us would have expected and we do track where our churn customers go and that might have kicked up just a little bit in the first quarter on the order of maybe one point higher but very immaterial on the scheme of things as far as trend goes.","On the acquisition side the variance versus prior year first quarters I would say that most of that it's actually due to what Charlie has talked about in terms of credit scoring and qualification rules and we had already started doing this a little bit towards the end of 2014 in terms of honing our profitability model and making sure that all our new subs are indeed profitable every subscriber is a mini investment for us the stock is an upfront investment and obviously the churn is how long we are going to get recurring cash flows to pay off out investment and then our margin on our business is how much cash flow we get for each month and we've been now continuing refine it Charlie I think is putting more of an emphasis on that then ever and that's how the bigger impact on our acquisition side in the first quarter than the Fox. And the Fox impact on acquisitions when we do takedowns like I said the return side is sharper if these are to measure on the acquisition side it's a little bit harder to measure and we think the tail is much longer on the acquisition side so it's smaller but the tail is longer just because it's the perception of that we get a lot of negative price during a PR off course during the takedown off course and the tails are a little bit longer.","One thing I failed to mention on churn side is our price increase we do a price increase every year in the first quarter this year was no different we had a price increase going to affect essentially February 1 and the trend we saw from this year's price increase was not materially different than past year's in fact possibly a little bit lower and if anything we think that the churn that we saw from the takedown may have pulled for at some of the churn that we would have gotten in the price increase so that's.","Ben Swinburne","I just wanted to ask one follow-up on Sling, maybe for Roger. How do you think about taking the product to the next level? And I'm curious, particularly on VOD and On Demand content, it would seem it's largely a live linear stream today but VOD is a big piece of probably where you want to go. Can you just talk about how realistic it is to get those rights factored into a $20 price point? And any comment on ad sales? I know you have a small base but it's different because it's streaming and IP. I would imagine there is some opportunities on the advertising side with your avails to do something interesting with this product that you don't do on the DISH linear service?","Roger Lynch","Sure. On VOD there is actually quite a lot of VOD that's available today I think we need to do a better job of making it easily accessible to customers but with the different programming partners we have now there is probably over 10,000 hours of VOD comp [indiscernible] so we have as Charlie mentioned earlier it's a bidding consistent depending on the channel partner whether we have VOD and what that right and whatever it is today it is frankly the worst it will ever be it's only getting improved because of their channel partners secure the right's that they can grant us or grant us additional rights if they have will be continue to take make that available so I think it started off live an obviously sports so continuing mostly live but as this business evolves you will see probably more and more viewership in aggregate in VOD I mean we already see channels that have lost of VOD content and on demand content frankly the majority of their viewing is of the on demand content not of the live channel. So I'm quite bullish on what we're seeing on VOD.","One ad sales there is lot of interest from advertising partners in this model for obvious reasons it's reaching a demographic that highly valued it's also the ability to do to highly targeted advertising. So that's, I mean we're just in the very-very beginnings and frankly the main thing we're focused on right now is making the technology work because it's quite complicated to make the dynamic ad insertion model work in live television especially when you've sporting events with a commercial break, you know you think it's going to be here but somebody called a timeout so it came in earlier than you expected, so all that, the main focus right now is really making sure the technical infrastructure works as it's supposed to and we're seeing no lack of demand for advertisers who want to participate in it, so that will be something we'll ramp up later in the year but right now it\u2019s really more about the nuts and bolts of making it work.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Phipps with Citigroup, your line is open.","David Phipps","Can you just talk a little bit about the upcoming 600 megahertz auctions and the AWS auction, as a run up to it you built a substantial cash balance in order to become a big bidder in that. How are you thinking about the upcoming 600 megahertz auction?","Charlie Ergen","This is Charlie, well I think a; we would like to participate, b; I think you know as we said probably last call our focus is on getting through the AWS 3 auction and getting the licenses, the DEs upping the DEs with ever we're asked to do, get their license approved because that auction in my opinion probably has to be a closed out before you can start think -- anybody can really start thinking about the, the incentive auction and obviously one of the undercurrents of motivations that are out there with some of the people that have publically commented on DISH is that there are some that perhaps would like to see that incentive auction you know delayed because there's really only two people that have a little bit in spectrum and they have duopoly in the business if other people aren't allowed to compete with low band spectrum, so obviously to the extent that could be delayed would be a positive, and one way to delay it is to delay the AWS 3 auction results you know potentially even blowing it up. So that's the, that's some of the undercurrents, so we have to kind of get to that process before we think of the next one.","But the second thing will be that later this week, people will be able to comment on the rules for the incentive auction and the DE rules, so forth and so on and we think there'll be a lot of comments on that as well because we think there's, there will be things that people want to change, as there always is after an auction, there'll be rule that people want to change about how they perceive the auctions. We'll have to see those rules and see whether it's conducive for us to participate but we have a, we have a core scale at DISH that we understand auctions and they're complicated. The incentive auction will be very complicated because it\u2019s kind of at least two or three auctions, a reverse auction and then a forward auction so it'll be much different, there may be a reserve set aside of some kind, of some amount of spectrum so, you know we're confident that if we participate we can participate at a high level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James, your line is open.","Frank Louthan","Just two quick questions around Sling, what do you think is the right target amount of content at your $20 price point? From the initial launch you've added a little bit of content. Is there an optimal point, do you think, that it will really get some more critical mass and take off? And then longer term how important is a broadband product of your own to be able to really be successful with Sling? Thanks.","Roger Lynch","Sure, this is Roger. You know we have added quite a bit of content since we launched Sling, so when we launched it, it had 12 channels in the base pack and today it has over 20. And I feel quite good about where we are with that content, I'd say there's not really another content provider that I feel we'd have put in to be successful, I think we have a basic content that we can be successful with today. Doesn't mean we won\u2019t add more but I think we're going to be pretty focused on the price point because that's I think a key to our success too. So when we launched it was a bit skinny but we knew we had other things coming down the pipe and obviously we've launched AME and we've launched AMC and HBO and EPIX and we have started launching Latino. And so our focus is probably going to be more genre tiers to keep more flexibility in it but all in all we are in a pretty solid position right now on the content side.","Charlie Ergen","This is Charlie, we monitor what customers are asking for and there is actually some surprises, and one of the surprising things is that when we look at viewer measurement between say on the DISH side and we look at on the Sling TV side so for example one of the things that jumps out at you is when you have those content providers that give us the ability to pause their programming and give us a look back right so we can start the programming from the beginning, or start the program that you might have missed yesterday when you can do that their viewership goes way up on Sling TV versus what they would get on linear TV with a DISH. So we know that there is things that from a consistency point of view we can improve the product on. There is just no channel that people are -- there is no one channel that people are saying man I got to have this channel or that channel. So I think my personal belief is there is one or two programming content partners I would like to work with that we\u2019re not working with today on IPTV because I just think their breadth of content is compelling and this is just they shouldn\u2019t miss this opportunity and I love working with those companies. So that whether we get there, or not with them we don\u2019t think we need to do it from business perspective from Sling but I think that long-term it would make sense to try to bring them on board and show them what we are doing.","Roger Lynch","And then Frank on the second part of your question about broadband, in my view the point of being over the top is you can abstract your service from the underlying delivery mechanism I think the risk there is what happens, frankly what the cable companies do and that neutrality to protect online video distributors enough from either predatory pricing or cost subsidization from the broadband service into the video service or data caps or all the many ways they could use their broadband pipe or broadband monopoly to port online video. So it\u2019s a similar we get reasonable protection on that then I don\u2019t personally feel the need to be bundling broadband with an over the top service.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Joyce","This is David Joyce for Vijay. Just wanted to touch on the programming, you mentioned how you do have a lot of packaging choices but I was wondering what your view is in light of the new Verizon FiOS programming packs. How similar\/dissimilar is that from what you do? Is that something you can do on it? And how could that be applicable both to your core pay TV service and to your Sling TV strategy?","Charlie Ergen","I\u2019ll talk it related to the linear service Roger might talk to Sling service. Each programming contract is different there is some flexibility in programming contracts we don\u2019t know what the Verizon programming contract says. And we don\u2019t know who is right and who is wrong in that dispute. It\u2019s not probably the way that -- and maybe the way I might have handled it five years ago in terms of what Verizon did I wouldn\u2019t do it that way today because I think that ultimately you got to work with your content providers and I think there is just too many opportunities out there today that you can work together on that you probably even if contractually you could something I don\u2019t think we would not only go in and do something would be harmful to one of our content provider. So certainly I have a discussion with them before we would something perhaps that drastic but I think customers are looking for choice, customers are looking for saving some money on video whether the Verizon approach is the right way to do it or not I don\u2019t know I think the way we do it today is still pretty good approach. We have kind of good, better, best packages. We have contractually done it with our content providers, they know where they are in those contracts and they know where they are in those bundles and it is pretty good selection for customers and when we get a bundled product you get discounts as a consumer. So still probably for most customers the best value I think the more concerning thing I think kind of the elephant in the room is all of those customers for the last three or four or five years that have cut the cord or those customers who last 10 years aren\u2019t paying for TV as they graduated from college and they didn\u2019t pay for TV and I think that\u2019s where Roger and Sling TV come in I think that\u2019s a much bigger segment of the market and it\u2019s incremental business and so I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re shining the flash light a little bit more to say look I think that\u2019s a better place to go. Roger?","Roger Lynch","Our packaging strategy is it\u2019s really is largely about two things, one is to make the price point attainable for people who aren\u2019t willing to pay for the big bundle and two is to get lots of flexibility. But when you see some Pay-TV operators and some of the cable companies now getting more aggressive with their skinny bundles and trading people down so they can try to retain video subs that maybe some people look at it and say similar to what we do I actually don\u2019t think it\u2019s similar. I don\u2019t think this is just about the size of the bundle. If you want to go to a cable company and get a skinny bundle you\u2019re calling your call center and you\u2019re passing a credit check, you\u2019re scheduling your installer to come, you\u2019re signing your tier contract, you\u2019re going through all the traditional Pay TV groups that you have to subscribe if you contrast that with Sling you\u2019re probably most people pick up their mobile phones create their account through their phone and start streaming, right so mobile first service. So even if some traditional Pay TV can be created exactly the same bundle that we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ll still reach different customer bases because of our technology enables us to have a fundamentally different business model and the customers that we\u2019re targeting for it are people that are used to and comfortable consuming content on mobile devices. So obviously we stream to TVs and frankly that\u2019s the majority of the hours of viewing but it\u2019s not the majority of the sessions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisors. Your line is open.","Tom Eagan","Just a follow-up on Sling, obviously there are a lot of over-the-top services that could compete with Sling. Roger, what does your research tell you about these 10 million to 15 million OTT or OTA households, like how much do they want to spend?","Roger Lynch","We did some research in the beginning on price elasticity but honestly Charlie would probably tell me we wasted money during that because we really don\u2019t really understand is that when you launch a service like this there is nothing really to compare it to previously. We felt like the $20 price point for a base pack is really the magic number to fit and we are pretty focused on making sure that we get enough quality content that we can appeal to a broad-enough-segment of the market and at an attractive price point. So, if you\u2019re a cable company you have a very different business objective. You have to get high penetration within a small geographic footprint all right that\u2019s where your economics are driven by. Therefore, you have to construct packaging bundles that can appeal to a broad segment within the geography or the opposite. We don\u2019t need deep penetration in a single geography we can get broad penetration across the entire U.S. or narrow penetration across entire U.S. So that fundamentally should drive a different pricing and packaging strategy which we do deploy in ways that\u2019s an advantage that we have. We don\u2019t need to do what the cable companies are going. We can do something different. We\u2019re not replicating that big bundle because we don\u2019t have to and it enables us to be different which lets us go after this segment that for whom the big bundle is not meeting their needs.","Tom Eagan","Do you think that your customers are also taking HBO Now and Amazon and anything else over the top?","Roger Lynch","We know that customers that subscribe so Sling TV are very-very likely they over indexed in subscribing to other streaming services too, that\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be a surprise but -- in the case of HBO they can take HBO out from HBO or many as many of them are doing they are taking HBO from us directly.","Tom Eagan","And then I have a follow-up. Charlie, with the Friday's appellate court decision out of the FCC, the FCC lost the decision to the programmers, but there's still the implication that the FCC wants to sign the light on the TV network bundle. Do you see any risk to the operators of the industry going more a la carte? Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","Well I think it\u2019s something the FCC has looked at and should look at and Congress should look at. But I think that there is just we think a la carte is a good consumer thing so we\u2019re one of the few companies that have supported a la carte consistently but having said that I think there is real practical ramifications about how you might do something a la carte is a I think certainly I think it\u2019s not just in that particular proceeding it\u2019s not just a bundle of video, I think it\u2019s really I think the bigger problem is a bundle of time broadband maybe bundling broadband or wireless in a way that would be non-competitive to people who have video services over broadband so I think there is other kinds of bundles that might be problematic. So I think it won\u2019t I don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ll look at a la carte not but I think they certainly should will and they probably should look at the different bundling techniques that are out there that are beyond just a la carte.","Jason Kiser","And operator, I think we got time for one more question.","Operator","We will now take our final question from the analyst community. [Operator Instructions] We will begin the media portion of this call following the answer to this final analyst question. Our final analyst question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan Chaplin","A question for Mr. Ergen, on the last quarterly call you said now that the auction was done the discussions would begin with a host of different parties through which you would decide what to do with the spectrum. I'm just wondering how those discussions have been going, what you've learned during the process, and where your thoughts are on potential uses of the spectrum now. What have you crossed off the list? What looks compelling?","Charlie Ergen","I think there are lots of discussions that have gone on since the auction A, B I think the price primary thing is that the spectrum that DISH already owned is much more valuable than perhaps the analyst community gave us credit for and perhaps much more compliant than you give us credit for today even I think the combination of video and spectrum is compelling. And we\u2019re also learning that the technology, the technology is changing. So, when technology changes basically virgin spectrum is a real advantage and the technology is changing and maybe I will turn over to Tom because you do that more close to that but the technology is changing in terms of how a network would be -- how you might add spectrum to an existing network or how you might build spectrum the technology is changing materially in terms of how radios and the cloud interact or the RAN and the technology changes in terms of how unlicensed spectrum might be used in terms of with license spectrum you\u2019ve heard terms like LAA and LTEU and so position wise we\u2019re in a situation where we always thought it was really good but we know it\u2019s really good and Tom you might want to just give add color to that.","Tom Cullen","Jonathan consistent with what Charlie said we had non-disclosure agreements with many companies that we\u2019ve been having discussions with since the auction ended. We\u2019re continuing those discussions in parallel with the DEs process that they\u2019ll be moving through with the FCC in Washington. And as Charlie mentioned there are trends that are going on like virtualization and with like unlicensed and licensed working in a complementary fashion. We\u2019re also continuing to work 3GPP and the standards effort to get our bands incorporated. And I mean I think as a backdrop you all know just in the last few months the emergence of things like Periscope and MeerKAT and the various OTT services, we know, and obviously many people in the industry have acknowledged that a lot of those sessions are not only wireless but they\u2019re mobile. So while a good portion of that is occurring over traditional Wi-Fi world with large bid buckets or unlimited data plans the consumption patterns of video consumption over mobile devices on LTE networks continues to grow. So it\u2019s opening up conversations with non-traditional players for us and we continue working those discussions.","Jonathan Chaplin","So Tom, as you go through those discussions, are you getting more enthusiastic about, a, wholesale model for deploying the spectrum, particularly as guys like Google come into the industry, as well? Or are you equally balanced between deploying it yourself and potentially selling it to one of these guys?","Tom Cullen","I don\u2019t want to indicate which one has more enthusiasm than the other but we clearly are adjusting all avenues and the wholesale discussion is a increasing priority I think in the minds of some players whose business models are more dependent on high-speed, high capacity, low latency cloud connections.","Operator","We will now take questions from members of the media. [Operator Instructions] Our first media question comes from the line of Scott Mark with Bloomberg. Your line is open. Your next question comes from the line of Phil Goldstein with FierceWireless. Your line is open.","Phil Goldstein","Hi, Charlie this is Phil from FierceWireless. I had a question regarding something that John Ledger said in his remarks on their Q1 call he was talking about how they are kind of adjacent industries next to wireless and his exact quote was if content and entertainment and social are moving to the Internet that's where in mobile these adjacent industries are in the same game we are in I think you need to think about the cable industry and players like us as not competitors but potential partners and alternatives for each other in the future so given that kind of stance that T-Mobile have laid out do you see them as a more natural partner and ally in wireless than anyone else or are you still keeping all options open?","Charlie Ergen","Well as you might expect we are keeping all our options open but obviously we admire what John and his team have done at T-Mobile and certainly we follow what they do.","Phil Goldstein","I mean do you think that you -- so his commentary about the adjacent industries to wireless being partners is the right way to think about the industry at this point?","Charlie Ergen","I do generally agree I mean I think the way we\u2019d probably even go a little farther in the sense that if you look at kind of where things are going and that is a long-term, longer terms in the next three to five years if you just look at that kind of timeframe everything has to be basically the cloud is a second brain right so and you go to be connected to that brain to do things and so it\u2019s not just wireless spectrum and video and it's going to be all kinds of other puerperal things that are all going to come together what you get back haul and you get all kinds of informational and entertainment sources that are all going to become through one pipe so and there is consistency of service and how you would do that and how customers can were to rely on that and what they will pay for and what they won't pay for and how unwise is spectrum get used and perhaps the better way then it gets use today so all those things kind of come together you said you have to it's a little bit easy for us to play in that market because we're kind of a new entrant right and it's a probably little easier for T-Mobile to play because or not quite as big and bulky as the big two right so they probably as little bit of volume and what they are doing but I certainly think that I don't know will our paths will across or not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Malathi Nayak with Reuters. Your line is open.","Malathi Nayak","Charlie and that you've been back in a CEO seat for three months I was wondering should elaborate a bid on your wireless strategy for DISH moving forward and have you also had a in this month's any talks with Sprint or T-Mobile perhaps in terms of partnerships both those companies seeing eager to work with you so that would be a great if you could just provide some color on that? Thank you.","Charlie Ergen","Okay, well. First I think have been CEO for about 6 weeks and obviously the wireless strategy I've been working on a long time although in time as we are going to lot more on wide of the strategy probably and I'm right now but look I think that I think where we are we can let two time horizons which is little bit longer term but the short-term focus is clearly to answer any questions about the wireless auction that the FFC might have that's a process that's going on through final comments on May 26th that we\u2019re involved in that and then we start looking at the next incentive auction in terms of where that goes and they will obviously that's kind of one side about the longer side of it is to look at is really the same answer to the previous that Phil asked which is how do you put all that together in the system design that's meaningful to the American public and the consumer and something that's makes their life better and something they are willing to pay for and Tom and his team spends a lot of time looking at those things so and obviously I don't think it would be a surprise that we as we go through this process that we probably will be talking to everybody in the industry that would include by definition and T-Mobile and Sprint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shalini Ramachandran with Wall Street Journal. Your line is open.","Shalini Ramachandran","I had two questions well what ways do you think and AT&T and Direct TV deal going through more effective and secondly cable operators looking more seriously at Wi-Fi first solutions and Google wonder edges how soon do you have to find a partner to enter in the wireless?","Charlie Ergen","Well I didn\u2019t quite hear the first one I think it related to AT&T and Direct to how it might affect us?","Shalini Ramachandran","Right how do you think it is going to affect you?","Charlie Ergen","Well I mean I think look I think that we believe that we\u2019re probably get back that one that we believe this should be conditions on that merger which we certainly we will make our points known and obviously that will scale and programming in an unprecedented way in the industry they have owned some programming including regional sports and they obviously have a broadband connections to large number of homes so what will have comments on those kinds of things but certainly they will have enough scale that they could cause mischief in the marketplace and to the consumer so we\u2019re hope that regulatory buyers will be vigilant as they have in the past and look at that and decide whether the merger is good for the American public or not and if they decided to get it that it can proceed that they bit remain for conditions on it and in terms of the cable and Wi-Fi I'm not sure did you get that maybe I'll get that one to Tom.","Tom Cullen","Well the question I think so Shalini was how did the cable Wi-Fi activities influence our timeline and I don't think it does yes we are clearly monitoring what's going on there and I think it's potential solution in some areas and not others I think there is probably a fall back currently and now in most cases but again that's not really impacting our timeline.","Jason Kiser","I think operator, we have time for one more.","Operator","Your last media question comes from the line of Mike Farrell with Multichannel News. Your line is open.","Mike Farrell","I got two really quick ones. I'm just wondering just along the line of consolidation that is happening going to happen does the Charter Time Warner Cable combination present more problems to you then a Comcast TWC merger would have and just one additional thing just on the overall concept of bundling do you see kind of the bundle starting to loosen up enough where distributors are actually having an advantage in negotiations now and just how are along those lines how are your Viacom talks going?","Charlie Ergen","Let me take the first part of question Charter Time Warner so they do a transaction we certainly look at that transaction and see and I'm sure just like that the regulatory files look at it each transactions it's a little bit different obviously Chatter and Time Warner bring different things to the parties then Comcast Time Warner the least of which is this Comcast owned NBC. So they there is all the section of business in the content side that I don't think Time Warner has today or the Charter has today so there will be differences but they are also be other things that are more problematic in a different way.","Mike Farrell","I was just thinking of just from the concept of their more real footprint would that have more of a direct impact on you if they got if Charter itself got stronger and could get more aggressive?","Charlie Ergen","Well I think they are pretty strong and aggressive now so but look I had to look at anything I don't want anyone to prejudge anything in terms of what I think we have always looked at it with a pretty fair and open mind and we\u2019re trying to compete and as long as we are allowed to compete we are okay with most things is just where there is things that don\u2019t allow you to compete that we like to point those things out. As far as the bundle I would say I've seen it's a good question I'd say in general the tail has moved a little bit more in the distributors favor but I\u2019d still in the content owner still has some advantages and it is probably a little stronger than in negotiations than a distributor but I think it has moved in the distributors direction some because you just can't force there comes a tipping point for content providers when it's a $100 a month that you lose more subscribers than you gain and so you start missing our guys say you start missing a whole generation and it's hard to get it back and there is channels in the top-20 channels that Sling TV doesn't have and our customer the Sling TV customers aren't asking from them for the most part.","So, that makes it finishing when we get to distribution negotiations with providers we are on with real data in terms of the effect it will have on our business I mean we knew Fox News was going to have an effect on our business right and we were it was probably the number two 2 channel we would never want to take down as a company, but will take anything down if it's a horrible deal because it cost you more money than you say so that there was a horrible deal so that's why it went down and if we get a horrible deal in the future with somebody based on our data we will run the economics and we feel very confident running the economics to what whether if taken something down make sense or not you don't I always tell my people here if you can take some down be prepared to live without it forever otherwise don't take it down so ESPN is being number one thing I would want to take now Fox is prime number two Fox News is probably number two.","Mike Farrell","So talks with Viacom are going on and looking [Multiple Speakers]?","Charlie Ergen","We're not going to have a discussion of Viacom in the public domain other than much we've had a great long-term relation with Viacom and their value partner we just did a deal with EPIX that with them I think last quarter or maybe a quarter before so you did get long-term relationship there obviously there are distribution of their content is a bit more dilutive now and if you are a Netflix customer and you can watch Sponge Bob or something maybe you don't place a bigger value on linear side so that it depends on the strategic direction of what of how content players go but Viacom's is fairly well distributed in the most platforms out there so but we have take that in consideration when we look at it for our platform. All right, I think that's [Multiple Speakers]. All right thanks everybody for joining.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jason Kiser, Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Kiser","Thanks for joining us everybody. I am joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman; Tom Cullen, who runs Corporate Development; Erik Carlson, our CEO; Presidents of DISH and Sling, Brian Neylon and Warren Schlichting. We\u2019ve got Steve Swain, our CFO; Paul Orban, our Chief Accounting Officer; and Brandon Ehrhart, our Associate General Counsel.","So I think before Erik and Steve give their prepared remarks we\u2019ll go and get our Safe Harbor out of the way. So we\u2019ll have Brandon read that.","Brandon Ehrhart","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in your reports. We also do not allow audio taping and ask that you respect that. Statements we make during this call that are not historical facts constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and\/or our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings.","All cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as been applicable to any forward-looking statements we make wherever they appear. You should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings and should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which we assume no responsibility for updating.","Erik Carlson","Thank you, Brandon. This is Erik, and good and good morning, everyone. At the Company, we're working with the time horizon that\u2019s approximately five to 10 years out. We've organized the business in a way that let\u2019s us take advantage of not only our present opportunity, but it sets us up for prosperous future. In DISH, we've got a legacy business, it really serves as our cash engine, it remains the source of opportunity in a variety of the distinct markets, including small-town America, commercial markets, premium markets, and really value the choice and technology that DISH delivers.","In Sling, we've got a growth business. It gives us an opportunity as a company to deliver Pay-TV to 100% of the country and a framework to deliver new business opportunities to both programmers and advertisers. In wireless, we have a future business; it allows us to serve as an innovator, a developer, and a participant in the coming 5G Internet of everything economy. Now our shift to wireless is underway and it\u2019s going to set the stage for this Company's fourth wave.","The first of course was our work delivering television to rural America with our C band products. We then forced industry innovation, the delivery of 100% digital TV to all of America with DISH TV TES. And Sling is at a new frontier in value and flexibility. It\u2019s the first live over-the-top Internet Pay-TV service. These first three waves each reflect the company that deeply values, an entrepreneurial spirit, innovation and disruption. And with our work to transition to wireless, we\u2019re returning to our route. And as Charlie has said and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll speak to it later, we\u2019ll start up again.","We have just over 580 days to meet our build out and service obligations, and we\u2019re on track to meet our phase 1 March 2020 goal to deliver nationwide NB-IoT network that will serve a diverse set of markets. Tom is here to answer any questions you may have on that front. And I do have a couple remarks in the business front before I turn it over to Steve. Since I've been in the role, we\u2019ve been focused on running a disciplined business and really shoring up our weaknesses; things like acquiring profitable subscribers and keeping them; improving the stability of our online platforms; and providing an excellent customer experience across the board.","Given the historical service challenges of our category, we believe that a differentiation through service is one way we\u2019ll cultivate opportunity in our segment. Last quarter, I referenced a couple JD power wins for team past quarter. In past quarter, we\u2019ve seen additional recognition from [indiscernible] ACSI and Forster. And we take that as validation for the operational investments we've made as we pursue our goal of customer service, leadership. The commitment continues and just one example of that is our announced a couple weeks ago, introducing Apple Business Chat as a tool to make service interactions simpler, faster and really more natural for both customers and agents.","We also validate our customer experience investments through churn. As Q2 churn results reveal, we are at historical low rates. Our focus on customer quality and service isn\u2019t new though but our results remind us that our work continues to bear fruit. We\u2019re bringing on board the right customers, customers who want DISH TV in terms of the technology we provide, utility and overall value. And second to first-class customer support experience we provide actually matters, not are we seeing the external recognition for that but our internal metrics are telling us that too in the home to the agent experience we are playing a much tighter game. Bottom line, we\u2019re tracking profitable customers who want DISH and who choose to stay with DISH.","Now on the Sling side, we\u2019re presenting customers a more flexible, innovative and stable platform. Late in the quarter, we introduced the new Sling experience, an experience that brings programming choice and flexibility to a couple broad categories of customers; those who rely on Sling TV for their everyday television and occasional; individuals who pride Sling but may want to dip in and out of a monthly service. For those users, we offer new ways to engage with Sling and content; options that include advertising supported video and demand; free content and subscription video-on-demand; all without having to subscribe to a monthly services.","If you're an occasional, you can easily become a Sling Blue or Orange customer. All-in-all, we\u2019re working to promote a long-term relationship with Sling customers; it\u2019s not just about a binary subscriber status; there is a lot of customer benefits to this approach; we offer an incredibly diverse array of content; and we\u2019re available on virtually every broadband connected fixed and wireless device; and our pricing is scalable to match the content you want. So we believe in our new Sling experience with its flexibility that brings us and TV a step closer to that \u00e0 la carte ideal many customers crave. We believe there is business opportunities found in this new flexibility. So expect to hear more developments on that front the coming weeks and months.","Finally, though it\u2019s not quite quarterly news, I\u2019d like to address our dispute with Univision. Unfortunately, many of DISH Latino customers were blocked from Univision at the end of the quarter. Customers are still blocked today. And that\u2019s because Univision continues to insist on rate increases that really have no bearing on its performance. Despite reported primetime rating declines of 50% over the past seven years, Univision has insisted we accept up to 75% increase over today's rates. That's really unacceptable. And it\u2019s not fair to our DISH Latino and Sling Latino customers. So we are offering customers price relief. As of August 1st, bills will reflect a five dollar per month credit for DISH Latino monthly packages. On Sling TV, customers who subscribe the best of Spanish TV standalone service will also be issued a monthly credit of five dollars. We are also making over the air antennas available for free to DISH Latino and Sling Latino customers in eligible areas.","Now I would like to thank our customers for their patients. We probably serve the U. S. Hispanic community for more than 20 years. Univision has long played a role in their heritage and they\u2019ve been a good partner. Now if you're just Latino or Sling Latino customer, I apologize the disruption to your service and I\u2019d like to recognize our frontline service team. Those agents and test were really working tirelessly to feel customers concerns. We appreciate their patience and working through a difficult situation.","With that, I'd like to turn over to Steve for some additional remarks.","Steve Swain","Thank you, Erik. I will discuss second quarter drivers in a minute. But first to assist you in year-over-year comparisons, I will highlight a couple of items. Last year, our second quarter results were negatively impacted by the $296 million accrual related to our do-not-call litigation. Excluding this accrual, 2017 adjusted second quarter operating income was $548 million and EBITDA was $748.4 million. And this year, it is important to quantify the positive impact of the new revenue recognition standard, which was $44 million benefit to operating income in the quarter. Excluding that impact, 2018 second quarter adjusted operating income was $529 million and EBITDA was $701 million. Comparing adjusted numbers for both quarters, operating income was down $19 million and EBITDA decreased $43 million.","Our financial results were driven by lower revenue year-over-year. In the quarter, we did see some improving revenue trends, continued lower acquisition expense and improved operational efficiencies. For DBS, revenue reflects a declining customer base, partially offset by higher ARPU. ARPU expansion in the quarter reflected the total impact of the DBS price increase, as well as a stabilization of customers in price log plans, where customers are now coming into and rolling out of price log plans at about the same rate. The ARPU expansion was partially offset by continued cord shaving.","Sling's top line grew. This growth was due to an increasing subscriber base and higher ARPU. Increased ARPU was driven by mix of customers taking higher-priced packages and add-on revenue, such as ad-sales and cloud DVR's. Please note there was no impact in the second quarter from Sling's Orange package price increase. The impact of this $5 dollar price increase announced in late June will be reflected starting in third quarter. On DISH TV, we have been pleased by the continued improvement in churn. Although, we activate fewer customers, these higher quality and more rural activations have had a positive impact on disconnects. That said, churn in future quarters will be negatively impacted by our continuing and potentially permanent Univision impasse.","Turning to expense. Our operations team is focused on improving both efficiency and the customer experience. Several initiatives are in flight. Erik already mentioned that we are using Apple Business Chat. Also, bots are handling some routine online questions. These bots through AI are making the agent and customer experience better. And again, by focusing on the experience, DISH was ranked number one in customer service by JD Power. These initiatives have reduced total customer calls, including calls handled by agents to multiyear lows, which is helping us variabilize our cost structure in an environment of declining subscribers.","Interest expense decreased compared to last year, primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest. We expect that this rate of interest capitalization to continue throughout 2018. Other income improved primarily due to an increase in net realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities. Income taxes decreased due to a lower tax rate as a result of tax reform. And in addition, last year's effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the $255 million litigation accrual, which related to the FTC action as potential payments may not be tax deductible. Excluding the post-tax litigation accrual of $280 million from last year's net income and excluding revenue recognitions, post-tax impact of $33 million this quarter, adjusted net income was approximately $320 million and $406 million in 2017 and '18 respectively, making the adjusted year-over-year increase in net income approximately $86 million.","As we look at cash, free cash flow was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis at $297 million this quarter versus $289 million in the second quarter of 2017. And consistent with our general intent to pay down debt, early in the second quarter, we paid $1 billion maturity with cash on hand.","With that, we\u2019re ready to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Philip Cusick with J.P. Morgan.","Philip Cusick","So Charlie, a few on the spectrum and the network, if you don\u2019t mind. First, can you talk about your confidence in the NB-IoT network fulfilling the build out requirements and address the letter from the FCC Wireless you had couple weeks ago? Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","I guess I\u2019d say that, A, you know we -- and this is all public. We met with every FCC commissioner and FCC staff on our network build-out and our plans, our two phase plan into the marketplace. We also of course not the first time we've been talking about it with the FFC, this is, we've been talking about the narrowband IoT network for about two years. And when we first started talking about it, I think there was a high degree of skepticism that an IoT network -- that narrowband IoT network was the business. And of course since that time, you\u2019ve seen Verizon, and AT&T, and T-Mobile now has a national plan all around the world Vodafone, companies in China very far ahead in IoT. So think it\u2019s now recognized that narrowband IoT is in fact a major contributor in the world moving forward.","The letter while granted was unusual, to receive a letter on build out. It's an opportunity for us, it's always an option for us to continue dialogue with the regulators and we always want to take advantage. And they've been quite generous with their time to meet with us. And in every one of those meetings, while those discussions are primarily private, the goal that they have to help United States be number one in 5G and the goal that we have a DISH is exactly the same. And so we\u2019re very pleased about that.","And in the world where the incumbents are going at hybrid networks between 4G and 5G and in a world where China is building standalone 5G networks and Japan is going to build a standalone 5G network. For the United States to lead in 5G, you\u2019re going to have to have, we think, standalone 5G network. And so we think we\u2019re the guys, we\u2019re the company that's positioned to do that. And it\u2019s very similar to -- it's a long-winded answer but it\u2019s important. In DBS when the world -- technology went digital, we were one of two companies that seize that opportunity to lead in digital.","And it took the cable industry more than 10 years to go from that hybrid legacy business to all digital. And DISH played a major role and the FCC was very, very supportive of what we did there. And we did things like 100% digitization along with DirecTV. We were first with HD, first with 4K TV. We were the first company with spot beams of local channels to constituents. So we have a track record of being innovative, disruptive and it may be on the -- maybe being on the very, very leading edge of where technologies go and we have another opportunity to do that in 5G.","And I think that the FCC is maybe just like many people in this call and many investors and that there is some skepticism on DISH\u2019s ability to execute that plan it's a big project. And I think as the months go by, as people see the progress that we made, you turn that into people coming to the realization that we can in fact -- we face same skepticism when we were going to launch satellites and compete against with -- compete against incumbents and major corporations. And we never done that before, it was a big project for us. But with a dedicated team of people focused on the right direction we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll be able to do that.","Philip Cusick","So if I can follow-up, the difference I would think from your digital DBS plan was you could go up and do digital DBS really quickly, and it took the others with a huge embedded network a long time to do that. With DISH, you\u2019ve got a massive network to build. And as others start to build a hybrid 4G, 5G network, how long can you wait before you really need to start building the big network rather than the IoT network?","Charlie Ergen","Phil, so I think -- I apologize that this call may sound a lot like the last call. But the big paradigm shift in 5G, not the market in 5G that you're going to hear about , but the real paradigm shift in 5G is Release 16 from 3GPP, which for standalone network is December of 2019, that's when the specification comes out. It allows you to do three things that you can't do in 5G today; it allows massive broadband; it allows massive IoT connectivity; and it allows the network to have low latency, so very, very low latencies.","We also are in a position with clean sheet of paper to do one -- two more things really; one is to virtualize the network in a day and virtualize every aspect of our network, not just portions of it; and to slice our network so that it looks like separate networks to potential partners and customers. So it's a huge, huge paradigm shift in terms of being 100% 5G with Release 19. So that release comes out at December 19, which means that people have to go build product for that. So product becomes available sometime later in 2020.","The second thing that happens is that our uplink spectrum. Let's take 600 megahertz as an example that is not cleared by the broadcasters fully cleared until July of 2020. So we can't build a modern network. The state-of-the-art we can\u2019t start building that until 2020. And we\u2019re hampered today just as a sideline, we\u2019re very hampered today in building network because our uplink spectrum -- we only have 5 megahertz of uplink spectrum. You can't build a massive broadband network with 5 megahertz of uplink spectrum. So we have a lot of downlink spectrum, but we don't have corresponding uplink. So we\u2019ve got to get that cleared. And it's not -- it\u2019s the 600 megahertz, it\u2019s still the DE issues that are outstanding, all those things need to get cleared up for us to be able to do it. But everything comes together in 2020 for us to build a modern network.","The competitors will start building hybrid networks, but they\u2019re not going to get to a full 5G platform without ripping out what they already have. And they have hundreds of millions of customers with phones. So the phone customer is not going to see that much difference in latency. So that some of the things that we\u2019re going to do aren't going to be that attractive from a cost to benefit ratio to the incumbents. But if we want to lead in 5G, we want to lead in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles,, smart cities, you're going to need a more modern network for that and we\u2019ll play big part in that.","Philip Cusick","So the way I understand your comment is, given the timing, we've got least a year where you can experiment, talk to partners, but really no need to nail down cash from a partner for that year?","Tom Cullen","Not for phase two but phase one, as I mentioned on the last call, we\u2019ve made a lot of good progress and it's the number one priority here at DISH and we've got a dedicated team working on it day-in and day-out. And we\u2019ll start seeing radios in the next in the coming weeks and the deployment will start in earnest later this fall and that as we've mentioned before, it can be funded off of cash on the balance sheet.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Chapman with New Street Research.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Vivek for Jonathan. I was just wondering I saw you filed last Friday in the T-Mobile Sprint Docket. Does this mean that you intend to aggressively oppose the deal?","Erik Carlson","First of all, what was filed by our outside counsel is the standard protective order that is filed with the FCC, and it's you know its normal course to do that. And we've done it in many other proposed mergers in the past. It just gives our outside counsel visibility to information as it becomes available, and we\u2019ll continue to analyze the merger as it progresses.","Unidentified Analyst","And then as I think about the merger, there are two opportunities that we see potentially coming out of it for you guys. One is they need to shut down a bunch of cell sites. Is there any chance they could divest those to you instead? And then the other piece of it is, they are going to be touching all of their 85,000 sites. Is there any chance that you would consider working with them to deploy your own spectrum so that way you can meet the 2020 build-out with a phase two type network? And how do you just think about those two options?","Charlie Ergen","I think, I may answer your question a little bit broader, I apologize for maybe not answering it directly. But when we look at the merger and we\u2019re still analyzing, obviously, all the fillings that they have. We certainly see their logic for why they\u2019d want to merge, but they still become two fundamental issues I think that are out there. One is they\u2019d be well over the spectrum cap in the marketplace. And so we certainly have concerns about where they might be on the spectrum cap.","And the second area, the competitive concentration, the HHI index that the Justice Department looks like they would be very high -- very high over limits on that or suggested standards for that, both on prepaid and postpaid. And as the justice may decide which of those are really markets, is that one market or two markets. And so we\u2019ll analyze that stuff. And so I think for T-Mobile and Sprint what happens is they\u2019ve announced this is the merger and then this is what they're going to do, and they really haven\u2019t talked about anything other than questions you're talking about. And maybe they would get regulatory approval for just as it stands. And the second option that could happen is that no matter what they do it's just too anti-competitive situation that that AT&T and T-Mobile were in where there\u2019s probably virtually nothing they could have done, they\u2019d just be denied.","And then there is the middle ground where perhaps they\u2019re able to work with regulators on remedies that would maybe attack some of the problems that the regulators might have, particularly in the spectrum and in competition areas. And so if that's the case, they may do things -- there may be opportunities for people outside of cable the companies NBNO or small -- there maybe opportunities for other people to work with them to help solve those issues.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks.","Erik Carlson","I think, it\u2019s small cable companies -- I mean small wireless carriers\u2026","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk","Tom, could you give us a sense of how many cell sites you\u2019re going to have to touch for the NB-IoT at least to hit the March 20? And then maybe what that translates to in terms of like a monthly cash burn? And then Charlie, maybe -- thoughts on CBRS priority licenses and C-band, is that something you'd be interested in? And if so, do you have cash on the balance sheet or financial capabilities to bid in those auctions?","Charlie Ergen","I will take the first one, Walt. We\u2019re not, at this point, disclosing the number of towers. As you know -- as you\u2019re doing RF planning and deployment that's a pretty fluid environment and the number of towers is changing as we make progress going down the road. So I can\u2019t address that specifically other than, as I said earlier, we feel like we're making good progress and we\u2019ll have pretty meaningful insight I think in the next four to six months. As far as the monthly cash burn, I don\u2019t think Steve we\u2019re disclosing the at this point. Right?","Steve Swain","That\u2019s right, we\u2019re not.","Walter Piecyk","Tom, is it that -- can you give us some [Multiple Speakers] is it like a fraction of what an existing operator would have, like any ballpark number in terms of -- because that obviously adds to how we look at the ability to execute on March 20, it was 30,000 and then we say like it's hard to do March 20. But if you\u2019re saying hitting March 20 and its 5,000 or whatever the number is, it makes everyone feel more comfortable about hitting the build out requirement.","Tom Cullen","Yes, I would only say that the 3GPP standard today is about 35 kilometer coverage. But the 3GPP is currently entertaining, changing the NB-IoT standard to 120 kilometers of coverage and some of the vendors we\u2019re working with are able to provide 100. Now you can't do that in every area, obviously, because of clutter and urban density and so forth. But that -- because of that level of propagation, it reduces the number of towers necessary to provide the required terrestrial signal coverage as dictated by the license.","Charlie Ergen","I think you can assume that we would have materially less towers in phase one than phase two as you get into some of 5G applications that once the Release 19 is that you'll need a denser network for sure. We have disclosed that we expect to spend between $500 and $1 billion on wireless through 2020. So they give you\u2019re a range where we think it is no matter how many towers it is, we're probably going to be in that range. And we're working with a third party for RF design in terms of how many towers. And then obviously once we get it to test, we could verify that the specifications that the RF design and the vendors have said to us, is accurate. And so we\u2019re -- the answer is we don\u2019t surely know, but we do know it's materially less towers than perhaps the incumbents have today on a nationwide basis just because the range is clearly farther to the spec.","Walter Piecyk","And Charlie, you\u2019ve been known any auctions, any of this 5G CBRS or anything\u2026","Charlie Ergen","So on auctions, I mean one is we don't have a lot of cash on our balance sheet to be a material player. Two, we have participated virtually every auction for the last 15 years. Most of those we have not won anything in the auctions, it's only been the recent auctions where we've been probably with -- along with DEs has has been the major players in those auctions but we\u2019re cognizant of our financial situation. And one of things in our build-out for 5G is that that we\u2019re able to is that our spectrum is mid-band and low-band spectrum that's ideal for macro sales. We've never thought that that was going to make sense from a small cell perspective.","And we believe the small cell should be a different frequency than your macro cell, something that incumbents haven't -- the incumbents have done at least a plinth, their first small cells were always the same frequencies than macro cells, which obviously brings up a lot interference issues. So we've always thought small cells should be a different frequency certainly that in CBRS and C-band, that looks to us to be potential frequencies. It did make small cells. Obviously, Verizon and others have looked to 28 gig for small cell. So we think that's a valid strategy for those guys and a valid strategy going forward as more spectrums become available. Most of the spectrums becoming available is probably, at this point, ideally situated for smaller cells, which is good for us because there\u2019s not really more macro cell available.","Walter Piecyk","A quick follow-up on the comments that were made at the opening about Univision. Charlie, you've been more open about the challenges facing the multichannel landscape than anyone else in terms of management teams in the industry. It's no longer -- kind of like it shows DISH losing subs, its DISH, its Comcast, its Charter, everyone is now losing subscribers. And I've been surprised that over the last few years, we haven't seen any real, permanent drops of programming given the breakdown of the price value. Cost of programming keeps going up and you're losing subscriber -- everyone is losing subscribers. Is Univision like -- is this that inflection point like where it literally just no longer makes sense, and we really could see permanent drops because the programmer just -- their view of price value is just totally different than the distributors?","Charlie Ergen","The short answer is, yes. This is probably an inflection point. At least in our company -- at least this time, I'm maybe a little bit more pessimistic to the management team is in terms of the permanency, I believe this one personally is probably permanent. And the reason is not because it's not the -- Univision is a good company, we had a good relationship, have good product. It's nothing. We\u2019re not mad at them we\u2019re not -- that kind of stuff. It's just that the peers wait the way things happen. They go to their owners and investors and say we have a budget and they penciled-in DISH for a 75% increase in their programming fees.","We look at it that DISH, which is what is happening to with our customers and where is the price value shifting. So we've noticed and this is public document in article that they've lost 50% of their primetime viewership over the last several years. And they lost the World Cup, which was their number one short-term attraction. And so we see declining value, not a 75% increase, but we actually see some declining value in there. They let go of their programming, head of programming, that doesn't mean -- they didn't let go to somebody who is successful, they\u2019ll let go somebody who wasn\u2019t performing on the programming side. It\u2019s not all their fault, they're caught -- they're whipsawed, because most of their programming comes from Televisa in Mexico and they have increases that they had to pay Televisa. And that programming -- novellas isn\u2019t striking the quarter with the younger viewers. So that's becoming a little long in the tooth as programming sometimes does. So they\u2019re getting whipsawed on their side.","And then what would further exasperate things is that their programming is available for free with an offer antenna and there\u2019s even a company apparently in New York that offers it for free through OTT. And then they also offered themselves for 799 directly to customer. So it would make sense that DISH and Sling would never pay more than 799 for the product if you can get it for that directly. Yet, at least from what I've seen and maybe there\u2019s -- what they\u2019ve asked DISH to pay is materially greater than what they sell directly for. So I've never been in -- and their product does not become more valuable to DISH today. In other words, the people who want Univision is going to come at okay. The customers who really want Univision at DISH will find another way to get the product; they may get it free in New York; they may go directly to Univision and pay 799; they may get it from one of our competitors in the future; they may put an offer antenna.","The early read, maybe Erik you probably know better than I do. But I think the early read is that where we have given offer antennas and we've given that -- we've taken care of tens of thousands of customers. Majority of those people are leaving the ecosystem. In other words, they\u2019re now become satisfied with what they get off air and they have Netflix. And Netflix continues to improve their Hispanic programming. And what going to happen is number one -- just telling you, the number one provider to Spanish is going to be Netflix. It used to be Univision but now it\u2019s going to be Netflix. And because Univision can't make that shift to work with -- they just -- management just doesn\u2019t do that, it's too hard to take a half a step backward and reinvent yourself, right\u2026","Walter Piecyk","And I assume it\u2019s fair to say that most of the subs that you\u2019ve lost are gone, like you\u2019re not loosing lots of subs now the way you might have been week-one. If you really cared about Univision you\u2019re probably gone by now?","Charlie Ergen","I would say that it -- our guys are probably better. But my experience has been that you probably go through a cycle where you don\u2019t lose a lot in the first week, then customers start given up on you, it peak somewhere between week-four and six and then it starts to decline. But I think we\u2019re probably closer to week-six than four. And so where the Univision would come in -- where we were willing to pay Univision more four weeks ago, you got to think we paid a little less today. And so -- we certainly have fewer customers that could get revenue from us, so it\u2019s a vicious cycle. And Univision uniquely had a management change, they don't have a CEO, they don\u2019t have a Chief Revenue Officer or Chief Programming, they\u2019ve had massive programming change. I've never heard from -- and Erik is -- our team has never heard from their new CEO. I think we might've been their largest customer and we\u2019ve never heard from their new CEO. And that doesn't sound like a relationship that they want to proceed with. And so that's why I think it's probably permanent. I think they'll be okay. I think they\u2019ll get half of the revenue they probably would've gotten from us previously or something to that effect. And we will save money versus what they would've charged us, so we\u2019ll actually drop a little bit more money to the bottom line over time even though we\u2019ll lose some subscribers. And we\u2019ll readjust and work with other Hispanic providers. And my gut feel is that Univision who use used to be number one in Hispanic programming that they have they been behind the primetime, they\u2019ve not been number one in primetime for many weeks now, starting with the World Cup on Telemundo.","So I just think that's where the momentum goes. And it's unfortunate but I understand why they have the position. I understand that they\u2019re also caught between a rock and a hard place with their programming providers. But you can't take it out on the Hispanic customer. We have to be fair to the Hispanic customer we\u2019re not going to gouge them. And we have other ways to get them that program at lower cost, even though that's a short-term negative for us. We believe that they'll trust us more. When we do that we\u2019re very attuned to the Hispanic community. I think we probably have the number one service first for Hispanic and we want them -- we may lose them in subscription but won't lose them as a customer, because we\u2019ve got wireless and other things coming that we want to be dealing with them on. ","So that's a really long answer. But I will predict this will not be the first skirmish, every single provider has got that same issue with programmers as they come by. And at some point the programmers will have declining ratings certainly on the magnitude of the Univision are going to have to start lowering their price not raising their price. Are you going to have massive just -- you are going to have some pretty big -- I think Comcast is one -- Comcast is in one now with the sporting company, so just going to be more of this in the future this isn\u2019t just DISH.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason Bazinet","Just had a question for Mr. Ergen. In your prepared remarks, you talked about paying off the '18 bonds and I think you\u2019ve been in the market buying your '19 bonds. Some investors are a little bit concerned about that maturity profile beyond '19. And so my question is, would you consider doing something, call active, like issuing debt to the spectrum box and getting cash over the DISH TV as to lay the ground work for you to refi maybe at a lower rate and I think even help your equity value? Any comment would be helpful.","Charles Ergen","Jason, I don\u2019t think I've talked about that, because I don\u2019t have any prepared remarks. As you know, I don\u2019t usually do that. But obviously we\u2019re focused on debt maturities, and Erik and his team are focused in that. And we\u2019ve been a good steward of capital and we\u2019re going to continue to be a good steward of capital and we focus on that. And then obviously if there's -- we've been opportunistic when there's things we can do that are available. But we do think that our debt maturities do require focus, and they are certainly doing that.","Jason Bazinet","But there is nothing that is off limits in terms of issuing debt at the spectrum box?","Charles Ergen","I never say never I\u2019ve learnt that long ago. So I think that where there's opportunity -- look there's a ton of opportunities in the company. We have really, really, really strong assets. We need to focus on the DISH side and we focused on some strength and maybe Erik can talk about that in a minute. There's some really areas of great strength that we can focus on and we have a tremendous asset and ability to build a standalone clean sheet paper 5G network and we think that\u2019s going to be amazing value creation for our shareholders and that's what we\u2019re focused on. And we understand we have debt maturities that we need to pay.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker","I am a media analyst, not a teleco analyst, so the talk about tower goes over my head. So my question is going to be pretty blunt. I guess Charlie, has the FCC given you any indication that your phase one 5G narrowband network will not satisfy their mark to 2020 build-out? Is there any risk to those licensesAnd then the second question, we\u2019ve seen your stock underperform quite significantly over the past two years. I guess what made you decide to buy some shares in the open market now? I know, it isn\u2019t a lot but you did it relative to other times when the stock has underperformed. I guess what message did you want to send to the marketplace with that purchase?","Charles Ergen","Well, the first -- to answer second question, I wasn\u2019t trying to send a message. I felt like that the price I bought it that was versus where I could spend that money somewhere else and realized I don't have much money outside of DISH and EchoStar. But where I could spend that money, that was the best purchase I personally could make versus buying Facebook, or something else that the masses go to. So that was just a personal decision so read into what you may or may not want to read into.","From an FCC perspective, I think -- again, I don't know the motivation to the FCC -- motivations for the letter that received. But clearly there wasn't -- the questions were about IoT, they weren\u2019t about any other network. Certainly, if you have -- I think that's probably -- you can certainly view that as an IoT network, it certainly meets the build-out. The build-out -- what we look at is discussions; we know the history of working with the FCC; we know what our license says; we know that the FCC, including the current FCC, has been pretty flexible to have people build-out licenses. And we\u2019re confident that IoT is a accepted way to build out a network, because it's -- the narrowband IoT is a service around the world today, so it's not something that was invented just for a build-out.","so I don\u2019t know -- only thing I can suggest is that people in this call should read the license and read the letter of the FCC and come to your own conclusion on that. But I think we\u2019re confident that narrowband IoT, not the first time we\u2019ve talked about it, we\u2019ve been talking for a long time meets our build out schedule as long as we reach 70% of the population with the service, which we plan to do. So it's hard to lay out every single part of what our business plan is for the street in detail. Obviously, we have competitors who then learn about those things. And obviously we would do more of that as we get farther along in the process.","But let's assume for a second that we\u2019ll meet the build-out schedule as that overhang kind of goes away. I'm hopeful that the FCC will rule on the DE issue, which that overhang hopefully, will go away. And I am confident that what you see happening around the world with 5G, people are going to come more and more to the realization that DISH has an opportunity to be a major player or a big player in the development of connectivity in the United States in a way that maybe the incumbents don't. So I think that's the path that's going to happen and so we just need to stay focused.","And there's a lot of noise and we know there\u2019s a lot of skepticism and we know stock price hasn\u2019t performed. But the way we look at it is what\u2019s the stock price five years from now that stock price is materially higher five years from now then we made the right decisions as management. If it's not, then we made the wrong decisions. I mean just long-winded but five years ago, everybody want us to buy our stock back. They want us go get more subs. We said, hey, world is changing, OTT is coming. We were probably three years ahead of anybody else saying that, but the street was saying why don\u2019t you get more subs, why don\u2019t you get more subs. We say, hey, we\u2019re going slow, we\u2019re going to put money where we get return, we\u2019re not seeing the same return in subscribers, new things are coming, new technologies coming.","So we didn't buy back our stock, probably wouldn\u2019t have been a good idea to buy back 60, if it\u2019s a 30 now that's probably not a good decision. We didn't go after -- we didn\u2019t go chase subscribers that in the cities they weren\u2019t going to be with us long term. And we went and got -- went and have made a massive investment. The FCC is well aware that this company has spent over $20 million, that's not somebody who speculate -- $20 billion to enter the wireless market, that\u2019s not a company who is speculating, that's not a company who is not serious, that\u2019s a company who is seriously possibly good about going out and competing and trying to make this country a better place in connectivity.","And we did it in video and I think we have a chance to make much-much bigger impact in connectivity, because this -- even the government decided it might be strategically important to have their own government 5G network. And it is strategically important for the government that it certainly makes sense to be supportive of what we\u2019re trying to do.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Tuna Amobi with CFRA.","Tuna Amobi","So I was just trying to understand a little bit better the trade-offs between your Sling TV and DISH TV offerings. I know that you mentioned that you are offering more flexible options on the Sling and some of those were free, et cetera. So as you think about the improved churn that you\u2019re seeing in the DISH TV offering, I know you talked about the better quality subs. But I wonder how that trade-off is working. Are you actively migrating some of these DISH TV subscribers to the Sling offering with the expectation that you could get better economics out of it? Or in terms of your Sling TV, also I did notice that the net-adds this quarter was a little bit on less than we were expecting. I'm wondering if what you're seeing there in terms of the profile of those subscribers, any seasonality that\u2019s involved. So just any color to help me understand better the trade-offs between those offerings in terms of economics and also what's the underlying drivers for the Sling TV, what you're seeing so far? That would be helpful. Thank you.","Erik Carlson","I'll start and maybe I'll turn it over to Warren for a little bit of more color on Sling. And Charlie just mentioned a bit in his remarks. I mean, from a DISH perspective, we really had a strategy to focus on customers that want a service like DISH provides with the technology, the utility, the price value equation, the whole home solution, et cetera. And we really focused DISH over the last few years, as we've discussed, on getting those profitable customers in the right geographies. And when you think about dish, I mean, obviously it doesn't require broadband the service is obviously enhanced with broadband. But it pushes us to a less urban profile.","And with Sling, obviously, one thing that's required to make the service work is broadband. And so it pushes that customer towards a more urban profile. We\u2019re not actively trying to migrate a DISH customer to a Sling experience. Although, if a DISH customer in urban America wants to go to an OTT provider, we\u2019ll be there and we\u2019ll definitely offer Sling and we\u2019ll try to round out that experience with an offer antenna, and all other things that Sling provides but we don\u2019t have an active migration process. And I think of the DISH side, obviously, you can see from the churn numbers, we\u2019re doing a better job of attracting profitable customers who want us to be with us long-term. And we\u2019re not seeing a lot of increased pressure on the DISH base from cord cutting. Warren, do you want comment on maybe the Sling experience a bit\u2026","Warren Schlichting","We think, Ron, it\u2019s something good. I mean we were the first with the skinny bundle and seen subscribers appreciate that. So we've continued that disruptive approach. And really it continue to knock down the barriers with smaller subscription package, pay per view, advertising supported VOD, really is a way of maintaining -- building and maintaining relationships with subscribers and with customers. And really it becomes more of a user that comes in and out, and we like that. We think if we follow the consumer, we\u2019re going to be on the right track.","Tuna Amobi","Just a follow-up on the Sling advertising initiatives, I know you guys have had some efforts in that regard lately. And is there any color that you can provide us at this point in terms of the traction that you're seeing and any quantifiable metric would be helpful as well?","Warren Schlichting","So I guess I would say on the Sling advertising front, we've seen a number of first there, so we\u2019re excited about the business. Really the two key piece of that and we got high quality of video where we know somebody is watching with all the targeting attributes of digital. So we've -- not only have we grown that business and we like that business but we've also struck a number of first where we have cross-platform, household addressable advertising that takes advantage of our existing DBS base and combines it with Sling. And so those are just a couple of examples that how we\u2019re cutting -- breaking new ground with advertising, I think I\u2019ll probably just leave it at that.","Tuna Amobi","Thank you.","Charles Ergen","Operator, we have time for one more before we go to the media.","Operator","We will now take our final question from the analyst community. [Operator Instructions] Our final analyst question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse.","Doug Mitchelson","Couple of questions for Charlie. So you answered Marcy's question and probably answered this one, but I am going to ask it directly anyways. There is some investors who are hoping you'll just sell the spectrum as a terrific risk-free quick return. And I know you keep all your options open. But it seems clear from these last few calls and your keynote at ConnectX that you feel the way to maximize value is to build out a 5G network rather than sell the company now. Am I reading your commentary correctly?","Charles Ergen","Well, I don't think you've ever heard about -- I don\u2019t think you've heard me talking much about selling spectrum even, question number one. And then analysts have talked about that but I think that we see such an opportunity for 5G in terms of what that does realizes is our network is going to be different as a standalone network, it\u2019s a little bit different. And we think the customer we might go after might be quite a bit different than the incumbents. And we see that as the long-term future of how this company is relevant 30 years from now. And so that's a tough transition and tough on investors to be patient while it goes through that. But that has been our focus and has always been our focus.","We originally want to be built an LTE 4G network. We just -- the rules on H-block got changed where we suddenly lost some of our -- from interference perspective and we had to change course and then we had to go downlink this is all things that took place we had to wait for the next paradigm shift. And that's -- the good news is the 5G paradigm shift is much bigger than the LTE paradigm shift.","Doug Mitchelson","I think the next question, which is I was hoping if you could talk a little bit about the $10 billion of funding for phase two and with the range of possibilities might be. And I get where I\u2019m going with that as I\u2019m trying to understand how to think about how much of the value of the phase two network build-out goes to equity holders versus what might go to those who finance the build-out, whether it\u2019s -- giving percentage of future capacity exchange for capital or have you do pick prefers, or equity. I was just hoping you could give us an update on your conversations on fundraising and how you think that's going to be structures? That would be helpful.","Charles Ergen","It\u2019s a good question and it\u2019s probably one we\u2019ll be able to answer a little bit better a year from now but -- I mean literally a year from now. But there is no question that we need to raise capital for the build-out. But realize we\u2019re two-thirds of the way there -- more than two-thirds of the way there in terms of capital for total 5G network. So run the math on that and it\u2019s something like dollar megahertz per pop with a totally standalone 5G network, right. The number of people that might be attractive to is very long. What way you might structure partnerships and the ability for capital are many, many, many, many options to how you might do that.","And so that's -- it's no different than -- and we\u2019re going to launch satellites way back when we didn\u2019t have -- we knew we needed partners to help us get there and we knew we need capital to go do that. And we were fortunate to work with a lot of great companies that believed in us. And it really will boil down to, Doug, do we have a solid business plan that people believe that that\u2019s a good assessment. And people throw billion dollars for guys whose going to put bikes out there. And I think our business plan is going to be more solid than that. And by the way, bikes need IoT to work.","But again there isn't an industry in the next decade that doesn't need what we\u2019re going to build; and tens of billions of dollars is going to autonomous vehicles, but they're going to need a piece of what we have; tens of billions of dollars goes to healthcare, they need a piece of what we have; tens of billions of dollars goes in utilities, they need a piece of what we have; tens of billions dollars is going into artificial intelligence, they need a piece of what we have; tens of billions of dollars are going in virtual reality, autoimmune reality and need a piece of what we have; tens of billions dollars is going into smart cities, they need a piece of what we have.","So first class I ever took in business school, I had to go borrow money to start my business, it was exercise. You got have a good business plan. And we\u2019re going to have good business plan. We have a good business plan but we\u2019ll be something that people will be attracted to.","Steve Swain","Let me just clarify the math that Charlie was doing around one dollar per megahertz pop is predicated on the cooperation of the DEs in that network build. If the DEs went a different route, we\u2019d still build the network with the remaining spectrum that we hold.","Charles Ergen","And we\u2019re hopeful that the FCC will be \u2013 I want to talk about that because the DE -- we had a difference of opinion with the FCC. The DEs had a different opinion with the FCC. It turned out the FCC was right. And so the course said that the FCC was correct in denying the discounts but they also said that the FCC hadn\u2019t been correct in not allowing a cure period. So the FCC is now in that cure period. The DEs has taken that and we have taken that extreme seriously. We realize that the FCC -- the point that we were contesting are one of the points that we were contesting. And so we\u2019ve looked at everything, every single thing the FCC has said and the courts have said of why that structure may not qualify and changed every one of those things and it just shows I think another indication as an objective reserve that this company is serious, the DEs are serious about trying to help this country be a leader in 5G. And to our detriment, we made changes there but we realized that maybe we aired and how we structured that. And we were wrong, and now we\u2019re trying to make it right. And so we\u2019re hopeful the FCC will be supportive and we\u2019ll get a decision on that this year. And that would be a major positive for us to move forward.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we will now take questions from members of the media [Operator Instructions]. Our first media question comes from Scott Moritz with Bloomberg.","Scott Moritz","Charlie question on the IoT network, as you point out FCC is a bit skeptical on narrowband network. They probably have bigger visions for that spectrum. But how do you convince them that this is a legitimate use of the airwaves? And if you can't convince them of that, what are your options?","Charles Ergen","Well, I guess -- I think there has been skepticism at the FCC, I don't know for sure but I think that's probably a logical conclusion. But that was when IoT was -- nobody was talking about IoT, I think that's material. It would be hard to be skeptical of IoT today given what I've seen in China, and Europe, and United States, in terms of what people are doing in investment in IOT. I mean that would like being skeptical of electric cars. This is going to happen, it\u2019s important. So I think that\u2019s not an issue. I mean, I can't speak for the FCC and I wouldn\u2019t want to, but I don't think IoT.","I think the bigger picture is that we don't have -- we and the FCC would want to have a much more comprehensive network. You want spectrum to be used in something in efficient manner for consumers and we want to do it for our shareholders and employees and consumers. So obviously, more massive network is on both of our agendas. But you can't get there with 5 megahertz of uplink spectrum. You can't get to that network with only 5 megahertz of spectrum clear. We\u2019re waiting on the FCC and the broadcasters declare spectrum. We\u2019re waiting on the DE situation to get cleared up.","And we have 582 days to build a network so we can't wait on those things to happen, because it takes three years to build this first phase. But the first phase leads to the second phase, which I think everybody is going to be pretty thrilled about, including the FCCs and investors and consumers. The first phase is going to be important but it\u2019s not going to be as massive as we all would like. But for our license that\u2019s not required and there is practical reasons why we can't make it more massive today.","Erik Carlson","And just in my opinion, narrowband IoT is here to stay. It will coexist with 5G. But because of its coverage characteristics, its low battery life and resulting low cost, there will be used cases for narrowband IoT as far as you can see out. Did I say little battery? I mean long battery life.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Sheila Dang with Reuters.","Sheila Dang","It looks like Sling TV added a fewer subscribers this quarter than in the past. And I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about what you\u2019re doing to gain customers now that the price has increased. And do you have any plans to introduce a new tier possibly without sports?","Warren Schlichting","We\u2018ve always said that competition is good for the category along the lines of all boats rise rising tide. And we are very focused on long-term, I mentioned it before. What does that mean? What does it mean for consumers? I think when you take a look at the way we're providing value and the way we're talking about those that come and go, we like where we are, we like the innovation. And so sure, I mean there has been a little bit of a slowdown in growth but we think we\u2019re well-positioned and well poised. Second part of the question is about second tier. Could you ask that again?","Unidentified Company Representative","It was sports package\u2026","Charles Ergen","Do you have plans for non-sport package?","Warren Schlichting","No plans that we\u2019re ready to announce for sure.","Charles Ergen","I\u2019d just add one thing I think that the category is new. And we\u2019ve kept our powder dry a little bit perhaps to go where people -- other people don\u2019t go. And some of the content providers like CBS, GoDirect and -- we wouldn\u2019t want to be burdened with something that you can buy somewhere else cheaper than it would cost us and that kind of stuff. And some people are going to all very big packages, which is going to be attractive as a cable and satellite replacement. But if everybody goes there, maybe there\u2019s something different that you can do. And so I think one this team has staked out an area that\u2019s very consumer friendly, because a lot of choice to consumers. And then it has to wait a little bit to see where the industry goes and where Sling plays a role doing things other guys don't do.","Erik Carlson","All right everyone. Thank you for your time and interest -- we have one more from the media. This will be the last question, go ahead.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll take our last question from Shalini Ramachandran with Wall Street Journal.","Shalini Ramachandran","On the Sprint T-Mobile pending merger, would you guys be interested in acquiring any of their spectrums if they\u2019re forced to divest anything during this regulatory process. And more broadly, how do you see that merger and these other big mergers that have happened in media, telecom, affecting your position?","Charles Ergen","I already answered [Multiple Speakers], because it\u2019s due we\u2019re going to answer it again. We wouldn\u2019t do this to anybody else. But I think that look -- we understand the logic of why they want to go together from their perspective. And we think there's two -- we\u2019re going to go through their filings and we\u2019ll probably comment on what they're doing but -- one way or the other. But certainly the areas that I think that they\u2019ll be focused on will be that they\u2019re way over the spectrum cap. So as you mentioned they have three times as much spectrum as DISH and our DE partners would have, so an as an example in some places.","And the HHI index for concentration of business is already high and would go much-much higher, and that\u2019s slightly different between prepaid and postpaid but that would be an issue. So they're going to have to -- they've indicated that they're not willing to make changes to or divest the spectrum today. And the regulators may accept that and the merger may actually be approved as it is based on the logic they have for the merger. There may be a situation but there\u2019s nothing they can do like AT&T and T-Mobile in the past where there\u2019s just nothing they can do, it\u2019s just anti-competitive. So it gets rejected. Or there may be something in the middle where they can have remedies. And they probably have any number of things they could do on the remedy with any number of companies out there that that might be attracted to them.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Your line is open.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On Sling TV, do you have any color on where the customers you're getting are coming from, in terms of, are they people who previously had Pay-TV, and any color about what sort of packages and add-ons they're taking? And secondly, I know you're including just the net adds in the gross. Any insight on the level of churn you're seeing with the product? Thanks.","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV and EVP, Advanced Technologies","Sure. This is Roger Lynch. When we launched Sling TV, our hypothesis was that we'd get subscribers from three categories. One is cord-nevers, which are mostly millennials. The second is cord-cutters and what we mean by that is people who cut the cord maybe sometime in the last four years, not necessarily people who are cutting the cord today. And then the final is supplementers, people who have Pay-TV, but take Sling TV on top of that.","Those are the three categories we expected to get subscribers from and we are getting them across all three, probably in that order. So the vast, vast majority of the subscribers that we take on do not currently have Pay-TV at the time they subscribe to Sling TV.","Many of them have never had Pay-TV and the ones that are cord-cutters generally cut the cord a while ago. So, really across the three categories, but a relatively small percent actually have Pay-TV at the time that they subscribe.","On churn, the business model for something like Sling TV is very different from traditional Pay-TV. In traditional Pay-TV, you have to be very cautious about who you bring on as a subscriber, because of the subscriber acquisition costs associated with that, the set top box, the marketing, truck roll, and installation.","With Sling, we don't have those costs, so we think of it as create a big funnel, bring people into the funnel with a free trial, knowing that for many of them it may not be the right service. It may be that a traditional Pay-TV service is right for them, but by bringing many into the funnel, you end up with a stable base after the free trial period and after the first 90 days, which is typically when the shake-out happens.","So, it's about how we expected and we had some experience in this from when we launched DISH World 2.5 years ago. So, it's an inverse of the traditional Pay-TV model. Make it a live funnel, bring as many in as you can and then you end up with a solid subscriber base that ends up churning at a relatively low rate.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","As a follow-up, for those who become paying subscribers and then do disconnect, do you have any color as to what's driving that decision on their part? Are they going back to Pay-TV or are they just deciding they don't need any service?","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV and EVP, Advanced Technologies","I don't know the answer about whether they're going back to Pay-TV, but the things that we see for people who do turn off, one of the big things is that it's a single-stream service.","So, they may want to watch ESPN and their wife may want to watch another channel; and on Sling TV today it's a single-stream service, that's probably the single biggest factor that I see cited as a reason that it doesn't meet their needs.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I have two questions. The first, sticking with Sling, the 10-Q says you recast 169,000 Sling TV subs to March 31. So first of all, what does it mean by recast? Second, were these all international? And then the third part to this one question, is the Q1 sub number of 13.844 million restated?","And then second question is a bigger picture question for Charlie. I think in terms of the DE discount, there's confusion as to what your actual options are or SNR Northstar's options. I guess the first is, if you decide to sue the FCC, do you have to pay the $3 billion first and then sue to get it back? Or if you don't pay, do you have a penalty? And then the other question is instead of suing, can you choose to withdraw your application, if you so choose? Thanks.","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV and EVP, Advanced Technologies","Okay. I think we'll try to take those in order, Marci. It's Roger Lynch again. So on the 169,000, those do not include the international Sling subs, which were at that time called DishWorld. Those subs were already in the reported DISH subscriber numbers. So the 169,000 are the new Sling domestic subs they were paying subs at the \u2013 Tom, do you want to hit the second part about the re-cast?","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","And that is the re-cast, is the 169,000. That's simply adding the Sling domestic to the Pay-TV number as we define Pay-TV to include both Sling domestic and DBS and it has always included DishWorld, newly named Sling International.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So the 169,000 as of June 30?","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","That was as of March 31.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Do you have the number for June 30?","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","Now we are reporting a single number that combines Sling TV, so that's Sling International, Sling Latino and Sling Domestic, as well as DBS in total. And we're not breaking those out.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","By the way \u2013 this is Charlie. So, what I guess the follow-up question to that, before you get to the DE question is, the logic of why we would do that. As I came back into CEO, we're fundamentally looking at the economics of how we run the business. And so we're in a mature-to-declining kind of linear TV business as we know it. We think we're at the beginning stages of OTT business that's going to grow and accelerate. Obviously, there'll be new entrants into the OTT business.","But the businesses fundamentally appear to be economically similar in the sense that the value of a customer seems to be economically similar, if you are smart about it. And I think that internally, the way I want to manage this is, I want people at DISH to be smart about it because I found when I got back into it a little bit that people were going in and trying to get numbers at DISH in terms of gross adds, but sacrificing quality of subs or not anticipating that a sub we get today is going to have five or 10 or 15 or 20 more choices for video over the next five years that he doesn't have today because he's going to have a lot of ways to get OTT, a lot of different ways to get video.","So the video business is going to be much more competitive, so you've got to be a little bit more careful about the customer you bring on at an $800-plus SAC today, whereas 10 years ago, he had three options. And today he's got four or five or six options and he's going to have 50 or 60 options in the future probably.","So on the Sling side though, if you bring a person in on the Sling side, of course your SAC is materially less, your ARPU is less, but the value that customer, when you think about how you do it, should be about the same. And so when we focus internally now, this is how we focus on it in terms of putting all our customers together saying, this customer doesn't justify coming in on linear TV.","As an example, he doesn't buy as much. He doesn't make a lot of sense for us to bring somebody into a skinny bundle at $19.99 at DISH when you have $800 SAC. It does make sense for us to bring that guy into a skinny bundle in Sling. And before we were bringing that guy in \u2013 in fact at DISH, I would go so far as to say it makes almost no sense to bring in somebody less than $50 of ARPU, even in the first year. So, again, we don't run the other companies in this business, but I think people are going to come to conclusion the the fundamental linear TV businesses are going to have to be a little bit more disciplined about how they do it.","We're lucky that we have the fallback of Sling. And so when you put those two together, you start to see a better picture of kind of where we are, but that's certainly how we look at it internally. And so you'll see Sling has a positive impact on SAC coming down, it's negative on ARPU coming down. It all flows through to EBITDA and revenue and the cash flow and those are the important numbers that you see.","On the DE question, I'm going to \u2013 and, Stan, you jump in here if I get this wrong, but we believe that the FCC has told us that the order from the chairman's office is going to deny the DE discount. I haven't gone into reasons particularly why that is, but they've indicated that's the case. So obviously, we have two DE partners, and we'd also have to consult with them and ultimately I think we'll work together to figure out kind of what makes sense for everybody, or at least I would hope that we would.","But one option is not to pay the money, in which case you immediately would be charged 15% penalty. Long-term that number could be higher because that spectrum would be re-auctioned and you would owe the difference between what it re-auctions for and the price paid. So you could owe more than 15%, although in reality when you really think about it, for various reasons, it's probably a 15% penalty. So, you would owe couple billion dollars and in theory you'd get your money back and life would go on.","Door number two is you could pay the money and life would go on. And it would eliminate some of the very negative handcuffs on the spectrum if, for example, you could sell it, you could lease it, you could lease it all to one person and so forth, which you can't really do today under the restrictions today.","Or you could sue. And, in that case, I don't know exactly whether you would pay and then sue or just sue or whatever. I don't think we know until we see the order. I think you'd have to be prepared to pay and sue, if that was the route that you decided to go.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. Charlie, following up on your comments on the return on adding subs, at the combined AT&T DIRECTV, we expect that they're going to allow the U-verse churn to increase in the hopes of migrating those subs over to DIRECTV. So, is there any interest at DISH to look to capture those subs? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","That's right. To capture the U-verse subs?","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Yeah. So, as AT&T allows the U-verse subs to churn and maybe go over to DIRECTV, are those subs that you'd be interested in?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","I mean, we would be, but I'd say a couple things on that. One is I'm not sure that's what AT&T ultimately would do. But certainly to an extent that a customer is going to churn off U-verse they'll try to have the churn and the DIRECTV installation all done at the same time, so they don't open themselves up to poaching right? But obviously, we could poach, we would. I don't like that model that much, because AT&T's already got the investment in the customer in U-verse, and then they're going to put another SAC on top of that.","That in today's world where some customers that will make sense and some customers that will be economical, particularly, if they can get a bundle for that customer, but for a lot of customers that won't make sense. They've already got the investment of U-verse going down the street. I'm not sure that makes sense. The only reason \u2013 it would make \u2013 they would make sense if the U-verse is tight on bandwidth. And so, it slows\/speed or you have problems and data caps and you can't put three HDs in a house. Then it would make sense for them to save their customer and do what you just said. I don't think we'll have a material poaching opportunity there.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital IQ. Your line is open.","Tuna N. Amobi - Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC","Hi. Thank you very much. So, Charlie, I wanted to get your sense on the Pay-TV landscape and where DISH might fit into that, especially in the context of the wireless landscape? When you think about T-Mobile and Sprint and possibly the merger is not going to happen, and I'm wondering how you view the shifts that are occurring and what role DISH might play to advance your overall wireless strategy in the context of M&A? Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Well, I think we put together a lot of building blocks, all right. So, we have almost 14 million in linear TV subscribers. We have relationships with programmers and contracts based on scale. We have now OTT ability which is a precursor to being able to do things in wireless manner and we have lots of spectrum. But, there's building blocks that we're missing, all right, and we don't have a network that's built out, as an example.","So, I think you continue to look at what the landscape does and as event happen and events sometimes happen that are outside of our control, and those events happen. They move you one direction or another, all right. But I think in terms of where the Pay-TV business today is, we're pretty well situated. We're situated better than most people are.","Let me just give you an example. To the extent that the FCC really goes through with the order as we understand it when we lose the DE discount that would move us more likely in a different direction than if we were to get the discount, all right. And there's two reasons why. One is $3.3 billion is a lot of money. So, if you actually have to pay that money or you decide to pay that money, then you've got less to work with and certainly it would make M&A, or it would complicate M&A and perhaps a way you couldn't do it, all right? So, that's one possibility.","The second thing is that the FCC's really \u2013 they can pick winners and losers. And they're always, in every situation, they have good arguments on both sides of an argument. And I think in this case, whether they allow the discount or don't allow the discount, there would be probably good arguments on both sides, all right? And the FCC therefore picks winners and losers. But it gives you an indication of what they're thinking about in terms of the industry.","Our bet was that, first of all, this is a very competent FCC, from the staff to the commissioners, they work hard. This is a really talented team, and one of the best that I've seen in 30 years. And this team has talked about competition almost from day one. So, our bet was that, based on the rules of the auction that they were set up for us to do exactly what we did. That any rational person would look at those rules and say we want to compete against AT&T and Verizon. We want to enter this marketplace and based on the rules, particularly with things like blind bidding and things like that, and particularly with DE discounts with no caps and no limits, that this is exactly what they want us to do. They want us to be disruptive in the marketplace, and they want us to be disruptive in an auction. Going by the rules, but obviously being disruptive.","So, to the extent that the FCC would say, no, we want you disruptive in the marketplace but not in an auction, and if we're going to side with the big guys and disallow the discount, then that's a pretty strong signal that you're probably not going to get into the marketplace in a competitive way as a new entrant. And it probably means that even in an M&A situation, you're going to have a lot of difficulties, there's more risk than we would anticipate.","The opposite of that would have been true had they said, you know what, yeah, we know that there's some pressure that the headline is not very good, that the company would get $3 billion discount. But we believe you followed the rules, and we think that competition is important, and we like the fact you're going to get in and compete.","And so, they can allow the discount. Then you'd feel more comfortable to go in and compete. So, I think that when you see \u2013 I think that we get pushed more towards, we still have all our options open. But we certainly get pushed more towards a sale or lease of spectrum. I mean obviously we have to work with DE partners to understand where we can and can't go. But, we own a lot of spectrum outside of the DE regime. And there's no restrictions on what we can do with that spectrum. So, I think we take a more conservative route. We take a little bit shorter term view of where our options are today.","Tuna N. Amobi - Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Charlie. Just following up there, it sounds like you might be less interested in participating in the broadcast auction, given the way the FCC is pushing you. And then second, if you can talk about an update on the 3GPP process? Where are you on getting AWS-4 into that AWS-3 band and any sign of a unified banding scheme that the telcos might go after? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","I'll let Tom take the 3GPP question. But on the incentive auction, obviously we in theory like to look at every auction we participate in. Almost every action, we typically don't win anything or win very much. Certainly, we need to see the rules on that option and where the FCC, I think, the FCC's going to come down on just 30 megahertz for basically the non-big guys. I don't think that's going to go higher, unfortunately. But we'll actually have to wait and see the rules. Obviously, to the extent that the FCC requires us to pay the discount in the last auction, then it would be a complicating factor for us in that auction.","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","And, Phil, this is Tom. In terms of 3GPP, as you know, AWS-4 today is its own band in Band 23, but that contemplates both uplink and downlink, and we do have a downlink election option for the uplink coming up next year.","In the meantime, we've been working within 3GPP on a new band which has been designated as Band 66, which is a 70\/90 band, and that includes 20 megahertz of our AWS-4, the current downlink, and that's in a combined band with AWS-1 and AWS-3. And that is moving through the process, and I think it's on schedule to be confirmed and finalized in December of this year.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk from BTIG. Your line is open.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thank you. Just going back to Charlie, to your earlier comments about the FCC signaling support for the duopoly and maybe not wanting to get involved with a challenger or being in a competitive market, given the depth of your spectrum, does that mean your options might also now include breaking up that block of spectrum and selling it in smaller chunks, rather than just one large chunk of spectrum?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","I don't know, Tom, if you want to add to this, but...","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","Yeah. I think that well, a couple things that we look at. One is, we look at the order of what the FCC says about AWS-3 auction and see what they have to say and kind of see how we feel about it. And then obviously DE's going to be able to do whatever they want to do about that. And then we'll look and see what the next incentive auction looks like.","So those are decision points, 3GPP is a decision point for us. And then I think the way we look at it is, we say \u2013 and then our uplink, we can go all downlink as an option. So, we have to decide that within the next nine months or something, too. So all those factors, I think, we'll be able to make \u2013 I think our evidence will be obvious which way for us to go based on those decisions.","And then it gives us kind of five bands of spectrum. One, if we go all downlink, which is a very attractive option for us, we end up with an upper AWS-4 downlink that can be combined with AWS-3 spectrum we won at auction. You end up with a band that is the unpaired AWS-3 band that could be combined with the lower AWS-4 spectrum and upper H Block and then you end up with an H Block, and you end up with an E Block and 700 megahertz. And then we also have 11-7 to 12-2 spectrum, which we have a vast majority of the United States spectrum as well. So we've got a number of bands.","Then you look at corporate structure. So, I think one of the things that we'll do and that Jason has kind of chartered with is to look at corporate structure. If you were to break those bands out, how would you do that from a corporate structure? And it looks like it may be more attractive at some point to split our video business away from our spectrum business. We thought long-term those two were better together.","As a long-term shareholder if I'd look at 10-year span, I think those things should stay together, and I think competing in the marketplace would be the best avenue for us. But if we're not really allowed to do that or were handcuffed by the government to do that, then you look at corporate structure and maybe you break those things out. And then you have a lot of flexibility, whether your bands are in a single unit, whether they're in multiple units or whether they're actually in a band could be in different geographies.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","So that sounds like...","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","(25:06)","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","I mean, that sounds like the old options, because you had tied this stuff together in the past, so now if you're at this point that the FCC is signaling this one direction, that's, it sounds like in your mind, opening up a couple different options. I know on a past call, you talked about when someone asked you if you'd considered leasing it, you had said, yes, I'd lease it. But now you're saying leasing is in the mix, maybe breaking up the spectrum in different buckets is the mix, separating the company. It sounds like your view on the options has once again expanded in the past couple of months. Is that an accurate statement?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Yeah, I think the options are all still the same and I just think that we would be, based on where we think the FCC's going to go, we wake up the next day based on when we were informed of that, we woke up the next day and said, on average, the leasing sale of auctioning our pieces of our spectrum could be a more attractive option for us and for our shareholders because the risk is so low to do that. And we think our spectrum is really undervalued on our balance sheet and by the Street. And that's the way you'd prove it. So you might split it up.","Otherwise, in my heart, I think the best long-term thing for our shareholders would actually be to go compete with the big guys and probably some kind of M&A and things that we could do there. I think that would be the best long-term option, but you're not going to get there without government support. You just can't. The scale is too important in this industry. And if the big guys can come in and get Congress to write letters and the FCC to make decisions rightly or wrongly, we're not that good, we're not that big and that's just too risky.","So your thought process changes by actions that are happening in the marketplace. There could be M&A stuff that happens in the marketplace that would affect us and there certainly can be things that the government decisions \u2013 decisions by government that force us one way or the other.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Yeah, the government changes over time. Chairman Wheeler is not going to be there forever, nor are all the commissioners.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Yeah, in general, I'm a pretty big fan of Chairman Wheeler. I mean, this is a very good commission. So, this is the commission that's thought about competition, this is a good commission. So I think that's one of the most disappointing things is this is a commission that we were fairly confident was encouraging us in the auction to do exactly what we did. And for whatever reason, they sided with the big guys. And so this is as good as it gets for us at the commission probably. And there may be a better commission in the next administration, but this one's really good.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Okay.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","These are good staff and these are good people and in general I'm a pretty big fan.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","All right. I think Greenfield had a better question. He was hung up on.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","By the way, we let you guys ask questions. We're one of the few guys that actually lets you guys ask questions.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","I know. It's incredible. We appreciate it, Charlie, sincerely. But we're not moderating the call yet. We've got one more step to go. Charlie, you had mentioned it doesn't make sense to bring someone on to satellite at a sub $50 price point. Is a big inhibitor of that the MFNs that your larger MVPD peers have which prevent you from negotiating better programming rates or deals? And then just tied to that, in that light, does making Charter into the next Comcast scale-wise a problem that the government should be concerned about?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Well, the second part of the question, the government definitely should be concerned about consolidation in the broadband business. They definitely should be concerned about it, they've shown that they're pretty competent in looking at that. So but you know, each deal is different within the government, so they'll look at this one differently than they did the Comcast one. But they're very much the same issues that would concern us. But whether it rises to the scale of actually denying the deal, we haven't analyzed it that much yet, we're just getting into that.","What was first part of the question?","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Just from the standpoint of, you had mentioned that $50...","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Sub-$50? The reason I...","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","...are MFNs the biggest problem?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Let me take a step back. The biggest problem in the linear business today is that viewership is going down, advertising rates are going down and everybody wants to go to the Street and say they're still making the same amount of money. And so what they did \u2013 so it started happening in 2012.","And our answer was OTT, let's put stuff in OTT, let's go to the customer and let's do that. Most everybody turned us down at that point in time. By the time last year came around, a few forward-thinking people said, no, I think OTT works. But in the meantime, people to keep their numbers up and to please Wall Street, they'd sold some assets to Netflix or to Amazon or to Hulu.","And suddenly a customer for $7.99 can really get his fix for a lot of different kinds of kids programming, general entertainment programming, documentaries, they could get a fix for all of these things and they didn't need the big bundle anymore. And so the industry's still trying to kind of hold on to the past, which is to continue to raise rates when their viewership numbers are going down. And it's been public that there's millions of people that general entertainment guys have lost over the last several years. And so the Netflix phenomenon makes it very difficult to get into that lower price tier and make any money.","The second part of it is that we have SAC. So no matter what we do, if we go from a satellite television perspective, we can put a dish and install incentive to a retailer to sell it and a fairly sophisticated set top box with a hard drive in most cases that's fairly expense. And SAC is typically over $800 I think for both us and DIRECTV. And that under states SAC, because we both give away free TV or discounts for a year. They do it for a couple years. So I've always added that in. When we sit in our financial reviews, I say you've got to add the opportunity cost of the programming you're giving away. So now you're over $1,000 SAC. And so you can't justify that for $20 or $30. It doesn't make sense.","But it does make sense for that customer to go to OTT, whereas SAC might be less than $100. He might have a smart TV. He might have a Roku box. He might have just clicked on the internet and bought the service. Your SAC for some customers might be almost zero. And that's a better model.","And so I'm trying to steer our thought process here to that, which is you don't really care where you get a video customer. We're paying the programmer the same. When we get a Sling customer or we get a DISH customer and they both have ESPN, we just write the check to ESPN, add the two together and write a check to ESPN. So, that's the thought process.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thank you. Hey, Charlie, I want to try again on the Sling TV numbers question, just because it creates so many changes in the rest of your reported numbers of trying to understand gross adds, trying to understand ARPU, trying to understand SAC and that sort of thing.","First, can you give us the number this quarter, just so at least we can start to understand better what changes are going on in your older core business, the satellite-based core business. Ballpark, if I triangulate based on some algebra based on ARPU, it looks like you ended the quarter with something like 300,000, call it, Sling TV subscribers. If that's right, then it looks like there's a very big drop in gross adds. Are we to understand that as you described it before, as the decision to say I want to push people into Sling rather than the traditional satellite model?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Yeah, I'd say a couple things. And, Steve, you may want to clean up what I say, because you know better than I know it. I would just say a couple things in general. One is the linear TV business I think is mature to the \u2013 and I think it's now declining. I think it has been declining since about 2012. But it's not declining in free fall, it's not crazy. But it did kind of going along. OTT is growing. So, I think you have a point when you say there's certainly more losses on the linear side than 80,000 or whatever it was. But we haven't broken out because that's not how we look at it.","The second thing would be that I saw your triangulation on the ARPU. And I think a better way to triangulate it is on SAC. Because I think SAC is only one variable and you can kind of see where SAC was, and where it went, and that probably gives you a better place to go. I think, ARPU is a bit distorted as you pointed out in your analysis by the Pacquiao fight, and I think it's hard to \u2013 you just add too many variables in the ARPU side.","And then you have to be a little bit careful in the sense that any churn that we have today in our core business is not something we did today. It's something we did a year ago. We brought on a sub that we shouldn't have brought on, or we gave bad service to a customer, or whatever we did. Or he became a cord-cutter because he now could get HBO directly, or whatever it is, it's not something we did today.","I've kind of taken a fresh look at the business and say look, we're going to be economic animals about it. We're going to be disciplined about it. We think we have most of the tools that we had to do that between linear TV and Sling. And that's how we're going to manage the company. Did you want to add something to this Steve?","Steven E. Swain - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, just to reiterate what Charlie said on SAC triangulating \u2013 if you look at the DVS historical numbers over the past several quarters, taking that as a input as well as the reported numbers and guessing, if you will, at Sling SAC and Charlie gave you a couple of data points during the last question. You can goal seek for the 767, which is our total company weighted average number and get pretty close.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","That's...","Steven E. Swain - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","To...","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","That's the way I'd do it. I think any time you can do an analysis and have less variables you get less \u2013 you're closer.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","That's very helpful. Can I ask a related follow-up then, which is given what's happening today in the media stocks, because of Disney's comments about ESPN, and the revaluation of the cable networks business, in general, does that change your view at all about the willingness of your content partners to continue to participate? If you did lose 200,000-plus subscribers to the linear model, that's obviously not something that the rest of the content companies are going to be pleased about, probably. Disney may be in that package and may be agnostic, but others won't be. Is it harder to see how you get content going forward?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","I would say a couple things. The balance of power and content has moved from typically the \u2013 it used to be \u2013 when I first started it was pretty even between content and distribution. It recently has moved to content owners as having more leverage. It's starting to come back a little bit to distribution side for a variety of reasons, but it's totally shifted to Netflix.","Netflix is most powerful content aggregator in the world today. And there's nobody that's even close. I don't think, from second point of view, I don't think there's anything they couldn't buy that they wanted today on original content for example. They pay a fixed price. If they go buy something from Discovery, they pay fixed price for it. And as their subs grow, their cost per customer goes down. So, when we buy something from Discovery, we pay a variable costs and we pay the same for each customer.","So, I think that no content owner today could afford to lose our distribution. And I think it's more of a case that I've said on a call previously is that we have to now look at each content deal and decide whether long-term that content to content deal makes sense for us. When somebody comes in and says, I want a double-digit rate increase and they've had double-digit viewership declines, we don't think that math works for us.","And we have viewer measurement real time from our customers, so we're not relying on Nielsen, which we think there's some inaccuracies in. And our customers may be a little different than Nielsen anyway because we skew more rural. But we know to the penny what content is worth to our customers.","And so, we approach a negotiation for content based on economics not based on the fact that they used to charge us this and they want a 10% increase or 20% increase. That's irrelevant to us. What's relevant is what do our customers want?","Let's take an example. Kids programming used to always be kind of right up there in the top two, three, four things people watch, but with the advent of Netflix, what our customers are doing \u2013 we know a lot of our customers have Netflix \u2013 they just go to Netflix and hit Kids. It's the kids who do it. The kids hit Kids and they go watch whatever episode they're going to watch. And they know how to do it and they don't have commercials. And the parents like that better, because there's no commercials and the kid can watch what he wants to watch. If they can watch an episode that's two years old or 20 years old or a 50 years old cartoon. It's irrelevant. They're not sitting on the edge of their seat waiting for the new season of Game of Thrones. They're happy to watch SpongeBob from 2007 and that's just as fresh to them as SpongeBob from 2015.","So the world has changed and we've been talking about it on our conference calls for a long time and I think other people are starting to see some of the things that we see. And we all we can do as management is prepare for it and manage our way through that economically for the long-term and not worry about quarter-to-quarter.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","That's really helpful, Charlie. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking the question. If a decision is made to go ahead and pay the FCC the $3.3 billion and you decide that you're going to finance that, either because you pay it yourself or you provide the financing to your designated entities, what is your view on your sources of raising that capital? And I'm particularly interested in whether you might be willing to borrow directly against the value of you spectrum, which you've not done in the past?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Yeah, I think it's too early to tell. I mean, I think that first we've got to make the decision on what we're going to do, and then we obviously have to work with the DEs, and they have capital as well. And so, we'll have to just go through that to see that too. I think the markets are pretty available today, and $3.3 billion is a lot of money and we weren't counting on it for sure. But we've got about \u2013 well, we've still got pretty, I know we have a billion-something on our balance sheet. So, we'll see when the rules come out, and then we'll just make those decisions.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. If I could ask another question about your spectrum. I'm curious, are you amortizing your spectrum for tax purposes? The wireless carriers all do that and they get fairly sizable tax shields as a result of it. I don't know whether you guys have that ability or not.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Do you want to take that?","Steven E. Swain - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, we are amortizing some of our spectrum for tax purposes.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","But not all of it. We have to be in the business to do it, and obviously this new spectrum is the vast majority or would be the vast majority of our purchases, so it would dwarf, kind of, what we paid for the spectrum previously. So, we'll have to look at that. But there's some opportunity there. I mean, there's definitely opportunity from an amortization. I think it's amortized over 15 years?","Steven E. Swain - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. Correct.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","15 years, so...","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Is...","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","That's an interesting point, and potentially a positive thing for us.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Because along those lines, your tax bases in the licenses you already own is pretty low. But, is there anything you could do to trigger a step up in that, if you had a leasing arrangement that was based on the higher assumed value? It just seems like maybe tax interviews is part of your spectrum strategy that we haven't given enough consideration to?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Yeah, I don't know if you want to jump on this, Jason, but I think tax consideration has moved way up our list as we look at this pending FCC decision, and certainly corporate structure would play a big part in how you might do it.","But suffice us to say that we think that there may be an opportunity from a corporate structure point of view to do things whether you are selling or leasing spectrum that might be very attractive from a cash perspective, all right? Again, we hadn't really looked at that too much, because that wasn't the path we thought we were going be on. But that is a better \u2013 that is an increasingly advantageous option to look at. Do you want to add something Jason on that?","Jason Kiser - Head-Investor Relations","Well, but I'd say we're taking a look at all of our options there. It's way too early to determine which path if any path we're going to take, but all those things are under consideration.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Jason Kiser - Head-Investor Relations","Operator, we probably have time for one more analyst call or a question.","Operator","Okay. We will now take our final question from the analyst community. Our final analyst question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Charlie, I guess I would say I'm a little surprised to hear you sound so downbeat about your options with the FCC and also surprised to hear you sound so complimentary, because it does feel like the goal posts have been moved on you at the end of the game, pardon the analogy. And you've got a long history of fighting a lot of battles in court with various companies and technologies going way back, I'm thinking Vista Networks, TiVo, AMC, Auto Hop, et cetera. Do your legal folks tell you there's no real path here to fight this? So, you've really just taken the result from the FCC and then figuring out where do you go from there, or do you think there's maybe a path to pushing back to this over time?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Yeah, I think that's really \u2013 it's my personal perspective, not really the question. But what's \u2013 because I think there's \u2013 look, if we think we're right, we always battle if we think we're right. But again, I have a lot of respect for these guys. They don't do stuff in a vacuum. And I've worked with them enough to know that it would be an honest disagreement and they would have a point of view that, you don't always agree with people.","But what's disappointing about it is not that, whether it's discount or not. It's the decision. The decision was black-and-white in my opinion. Are you for competition, are you for the incumbents? But nobody has the power to shift the FCC unless they're pretty big guys.","And if you come down for competition, you'd say DISH followed the rules to get a discount and obviously there would have been I think a lot of opportunity within the M&A space to get to stronger people to compete against the top two guys, which really have a duopoly today. If you come down and say the discounts disallowed it then snowballs into a bunch of different things.","One is, it would make virtually impossible M&A for us, based on the complication that it complicates and the uncertainty that you're going have based on that decision. Secondly, you end up with no restrictions on the spectrum. So now you can lease all of it. If you can lease all of it, there's guys that want AWS-3 spectrum that are going to build that out and it doesn't cost them much to add our frequencies at the same time. So if you go to the tower and do it all at one time, there's a lot of economies of scale and synergy there.","And so what might happen is, you end up in an auction where AT&T and Verizon get 70% of the auction and because DISH was innovative and worked with DEs and did what has been done in the past and with no restriction on the amount of discount, we entered that auction. They only got 70% instead of 85% of the auction. But as a result of losing the discount, in theory AT&T and Verizon in my opinion, and maybe to some degree T-Mobile, but AT&T and Verizon probably end up with virtually all of the spectrum out of that auction. That's horrible from a competition point of view.","And so you then, in my opinion, at that point, you've probably got Sprint and T-Mobile more realistically being able to go together, but from a position of weakness. And you go from four to three. And so that's probably where the world goes. And it's all based on one decision and one auction where the government picked winners and losers.","And I made a mistake in judgment in that I believed this administration would, despite the political pressure, despite the big guys being upset, that this administration would go for competition. And that's not what the decision they're going to make as we understand it.","So that's disappointing. I think it's probably good for shareholders in the short run. And it's certainly a much more conservative approach for us. But it's not as exciting to me as an entrepreneur and it's certainly not as exciting to me long term. But that's the way we would be leaning today, because ultimately we're going to run this company for our shareholders and do the right thing that we think is the best economic judgment we can make regardless of where our passion would be.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We will now take questions from the members of the media. Our first media question comes from the line of Alex Sherman of Bloomberg. Your line is open.","Alex Sherman - Bloomberg LP","Hey, guys. Thanks as always for doing this. Two questions. The first one is, Charlie, just to follow along with your last answer there, when you got the waiver from the FCC on the DBSD and the TerreStar spectrum, part of the rationale was that DISH would add more competition to the wireless market. So given that, do you feel like the FCC would be okay with you turning around and selling that spectrum to AT&T or Verizon?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Well, there's no restrictions on us to do that. In the auction, there's restrictions. One thing people don't realize, you get a discount with a DE, but you also get handcuffs. You can't lease that spectrum, more than 25% of that spectrum to somebody and you can't sell that spectrum without paying the discount back. You have handcuffs. Those handcuffs go away if you pay the discount.","And there's no restrictions on the DBSD TerreStar. There never have been. And so, I don't think there's any \u2013 again, you want to jump in on that, Stan? I don't think there's anything that would prevent us today from our existing spectrum to sell it or lease it other than the spectrum cap that the FCC has. In terms of existing spectrum.","Alex Sherman - Bloomberg LP","Okay. Second question...","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","I'm sorry.","Alex Sherman - Bloomberg LP","Go ahead.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","No, I think the government tells you where they want you to go. They make decisions and it's almost \u2013 you don't have to be a genius to read between the lines. They told Sprint and T-Mobile they didn't think they wanted them to merge. They gave lots of signals. They are telling us that lease or sell your spectrum is okay. Because the restrictions would be removed if you pay the discount. I'm not going to cry about it or lose any sleep over it. It's just disappointing because that's not in our heart where we wanted to go. But that's what they seem to be supporting.","R. Stanton Dodge - Secretary, Executive VP & General Counsel","All that being said, we're still waiting to see the final order. And until we have a chance to understand what's in the order and evaluate it with our DE partners, we don't know what next step we'll take to those licenses.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Yeah, we still have all the other options. It's just that I'm trying to be realistic with our investors which is, if you were sitting in our shoes and you said, I'll make it up, 80% think this is the way to go, and then there's another decision rightly or wrongly then you re-evaluate that 80%. And you might say I'm only 30% that way and 50% a different way. And so I think we're taking a good hard look at that. And once we read the order and once we talk to the DEs about where they're going, we'll have a better idea.","Alex Sherman - Bloomberg LP","What is the value of your current spectrum holdings as far as you see it? Obviously analysts have guessed a lot about this. As far as you see it, how do you value your holdings? What's the dollar value?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Well, I don't know. The people that know are the people in the business. And the auction because of DISH's participation and because of DEs that we work with and other DEs, I think there's like 15 or 17 DEs in that auction with no restrictions. That auction was one of the first \u2013 that may have been the only competitive auction that I've been involved in where people had to pay the market price. The people who really know the value of spectrum, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, AT&T and Verizon paid about $2.90 for paired spectrum per megahertz POP. So that'll give you a pretty good market read of what people were willing to pay. Nobody put a gun to their head and said you got to pay $2.90. They voluntarily paid that.","So one of the reasons is because that's high capacity spectrum, because data usage is going up, this is the spectrum that has high capacity. The incentive auctions is coverage capacity, but it's not high capacity spectrum. And probably based on the rules where they're going to get the DE program that spectrum is probably going to go materially lower than this high capacity spectrum. And DISH owns mostly high capacity spectrum which is great for data.","The second thing is we have more downlink than uplink. And the paired spectrum went for $2.90 the unpaired uplink only went for $0.50 a megahertz POP. So you can see that I'll make it up, downlink is probably worth eight \u2013 six, eight times what uplink is. And we have a lot more downlink than uplink. So, our spectrum is valuable.","The second piece of it is that, I think you have to look at it, if I was looking at the spectrum you have to take the value of the spectrum, but you also have to take the cost of building it out. Add those two together and that kind of gives you the value of spectrum. So anybody who want AWS-3 spectrum is going to build it out. If they can build our spectrum at the same time, then the incremental cost to build it out is very low.","If you have to build our spectrum out by itself then you have to add that cost and it takes away from the value of your spectrum. All those variables are in there. But I think the last auction is a pretty good proxy of where the market is for high capacity spectrum. And obviously the Street values it much lower on our balance sheet. In part, because we have to use it. It has to get used then it gets economized and then it gets a value.","Alex Sherman - Bloomberg LP","Last question for you Charlie. Are you implying that if the FCC had ruled differently and had given you the discount, that you would be much closer to owning T-Mobile today? Or were there just too many other complications in that deal, valuation, structure complications that sort of was the biggest obstacle to the talks that you guys have had?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","From our perspective, the discount was the most complicating factor.","Alex Sherman - Bloomberg LP","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Goldstein from FierceWireless. Your line is open.","Phil Goldstein - FierceWireless","Hi, Charlie. Thank you guys for doing this. I'm not sure, Charlie, if you want to answer this, or if you want to toss it to Tom. In May, Tom, you've talked about some of the discussions that DISH was having under NDA with lots of different wireless players. Just wondering if you could give me some color or an update on how those are going?","It sounds like from what you've said, Charlie, that if the FCC does order you guys to pay back the discount, you're more inclined to do some kind of sale or leasing. Just wondering how you guys are thinking about that, especially in light of T-Mobile's continued comments about being willing and open to partner with non-wireless carriers. John Legere's talked again about cable companies, about the Googles of the world, et cetera. And then separately, just wondering if I could get an update from Tom on the build out time lines for AWS-4 and what those stand at this point?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Do you want to take part of that and then I'll?","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","Sure. Well, I have nothing specific to share regarding conversations in the industry, but as you noted and others have noted, we look at the spectrum being potentially valuable or the capacity from that spectrum being potentially valuable to a broader range of industry participants than just the incumbent carriers. As for AWS-4 build out, the downlink election date, I think, is June 20 of next year. And the final build out if we were to miss the interim build out, the final build out is 70% of POPs by EA, by March of 2020.","Phil Goldstein - FierceWireless","Okay. And there's a 40% somewhere in there for 2017.","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","There's a 40% interim build out requirement in March of 2017. But it's irrelevant on the 2020 timeframe. If you meet the interim build out, then year 2021, right? And then AWS-3 spectrum is 2025.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","AWS-3 is 12 years from the time the licenses are granted, 2027. So that hasn't even started. And E Block is the same as AWS-4. H Block is April of 2022, if the interim build out is missed.","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","But it does \u2013 look, the build out requirements are interesting. But what's really interesting about that we have enough time that you're probably in a situation where things like 5G you're going to see in this timeframe. And you're going to run into \u2013 today, I think you build out 4G, and I don't think you'd be questioned about it. But I think as you get closer to that timeframe, you start thinking you're not going to build out the old technology. Build out the new technology, you build out 5G. So, we'll just have to see kind of how it all plays out.","Phil Goldstein - FierceWireless","Right. It just sounds like you guys are leaning more towards some kind of spectrum hosting arrangement or leasing than anything else at this point.","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","There's nothing definitive, Phil. But as Charlie said, the combination of events that have occurred recently have forced us to take a fresh look at alternative options. So with that, operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Our last question from the media comes from the line of Paul Kirby from TR Daily. Your line is open.","Paul Kirby - TR Daily","You said earlier, Charlie, that if the FCC disallows the discounts, it would be a complicating factor for you in the incentive auction. Just to kind of press that a little more, are you less likely to participate in the incentive auction if you don't get the bidding credits?","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","Well, I mean, look, it's complicating. But, we're going to look at the auction. We're going to see the rules. We'll see if there's a way to participate. Obviously, my board's going ask a lot more questions like can they change rules at the end. And so, I think there's $3.3 billion of complications, potentially. And I think there's a trust factor complication.","Paul Kirby - TR Daily","Right. Thanks a lot.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","But that doesn't say, then I'm not saying that we wouldn't participate. I just think that I'm being realistic about it, when I go to the board that I think people \u2013 we'll have to read the order. We'll have to read the orders and see what it says, see what people think and see how honest the disagreement is.","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","Well, we have to see the AWS-3 order. But in addition, as you know, the DE rules, I mean the incentive auction rules are not out yet, either. I think they're due to be released tomorrow, but it's not clear that that will even include all the time lines regarding filing dates. So in both cases, we're just waiting to read and digest the orders that come out. And then we'll evaluate next steps after that.","Paul Kirby - TR Daily","Okay. Thanks.","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","All right. Thanks, everybody.","Charles William Ergen - Executive Chairman, President & CEO","So with that, thank you all for your participation. Operator, the call is over.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Clayton","Thanks, Brandon, and good afternoon to those of you on the East Coast and good morning to our West Coast participants. Now today, I'm going to report on the progress that we have made in the first quarter as we continued to improve our best-in-class video experience, to grow incremental revenue streams and to strengthen our core pay-TV business. Charlie and Tom Cullen are also here to take your questions on our spectrum status a little later.","Now most noteworthy, in early March, we signed a new long-term programming contract with The Walt Disney Company. This historic agreement is really about the future of digital television, both in terms of technology and advertising. This landmark deal also delivers the best in sports, news and entertainment, both in and out of the home. In fact, DISH is the Southeastern Conference network's first nationwide television partner. It's also worth noting that our agreement with Disney also gives us carriage rights for the Texas Longhorn network. Now when combined with the nationwide availability of Pac-12 sports and the Big Ten Network, there is no better place for college sports fans than here at DISH.","Now turning to our marketing efforts. During the NCAA college basketball tournament, we introduced a new national marketing campaign featuring the voice of award-winning actress Rebel Wilson, as Hopper, the DISH kangaroo. The advertising message played off the consumers' trend of streaming March Madness, a phenomenon that has grown exponentially over the past few years. And unlike the competition, only DISH allows consumers to Sling all of their live and recorded TV anywhere.","Now let's move on to broadband. We continue to see significant growth in both dishNET's satellite and wireline businesses. In the first quarter, we added over 50,000 dishNET customers, bringing our base to approximately 489,000 subscribers. We're focused on adding higher-quality customers, up-selling subscribers to more monthly services and improving operational synergies. This allows us to leverage the power of DISH satellite TV with the dishNET broadband bundle.","Now as veterans of an industry that continues to mature, we have concentrated on improving productivity and on maximizing the value of our core pay-TV business. For example, with careful application of customer retention tools, our first quarter churn came in at 1.42%, a 5 basis point improvement compared to last year. In total, we gained a little over 40,000 pay-TV customers in the first quarter. And secondly, in a mature business, you must exercise discipline in realizing efficiencies, and that's exactly what we did in the first quarter as we drove higher sales close rates, improved call center utilization and lowered service call rates.","Now we still have more work ahead of us, but we believe that we have the right plans and programs in place to attain our goals.","Now to provide you all with additional details on our financial performance, here's our CFO, Robert Olson.","Robert E. Olson","Thank you. As Joe noted, we continue to make progress in growing our core business. Our pay-TV base increased by 40,000 subscribers in the quarter. This was modestly better than the growth we saw in the first quarter 2013 due to slightly better churn this year. Pay-TV churn was down 5 basis points year-over-year as we continue to refine our customer retention efforts.","Our broadband business continued to experience solid growth. We ended the quarter with 489,000 broadband subscribers, up 240,000 subscribers versus the same time last year. Broadband churn rate was down year-over-year. But with our larger base, total disconnects were higher.","Revenue increased $219 million or 6.5% in the first quarter compared to last year. This growth was largely driven by pay-TV ARPU, which was up almost $4 or 5% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, we saw about half of the benefit of our price increase in our first quarter ARPU and expect to see the full benefit in second quarter ARPU. Our broadband business also contributed to the subscriber-related revenue growth, accounting for $42 million of the year-over-year revenue increase.","Subscriber-related expenses increased by 8.2% in the first quarter versus last year. This increase was largely due to higher pay-TV programming expense. The higher broadband subscriber-related expenses contributed roughly 1 point of the year-over-year increase. The higher programming costs were primarily driven by increases in our contractual rates. The increased broadband expenses were driven by higher average subscriber levels.","Our pay-TV SAC per activation for the quarter was $862, which was roughly in line with our recent number. The year-over-year decrease of $20 was driven by a reduction in manufacturing costs of Hopper with Sling receiver systems and a onetime impact associated with increased inventory subsidies provided to third-party sales channels in first quarter 2013, which we discussed in our call last year.","Satellite and transmission expense was up $14 million sequentially and $26 million year-over-year. These increases were primarily driven by the satellite and tracking stock transaction with EchoStar, which was effective on March 1.","Administrative expenses were down sequentially, but up $30 million year-over-year in the first quarter. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by onetime items, including spectrum, M&A expense in 2014 and a favorable sales tax settlement we received in 2013. We also incurred additional engineering expense from EchoStar associated with enhancements to our Hopper receiver system. We expect G&A expense to be relatively flat compared to 2013 for the rest of the year. Depreciation expense was up $19 million year-over-year in the first quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by a larger percentage of Hopper receiver systems within our installed customer base.","Despite relatively flat operating income year-over-year, net income declined by 18%, driven by reductions in other income. Interest income was down $23 million year-over-year. While our cash and marketable securities balance was higher year-over-year, the sale of certain debt security in the fourth quarter reduced our average rate. Interest expense was up $14 million year-over-year as we issued $2.3 billion of debt in the second quarter 2013.","We generated $383 million of adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter, which was considerably above net income. We expect free cash flow will be roughly in the same ballpark as net income for the full year 2014. There is normal seasonality to free cash flow, with the first quarter typically higher and second quarter typically lower due to the timing of tax payments.","Relative to our year end 2013 balance sheet, we saw reductions of approximately $800 million in cash and marketable securities driven by the March 28 payment to the FCC for the H-block licenses.","Let me now turn it back to Joe before we start Q&A.","Joseph P. Clayton","Okay. Thanks, Robert. As I said earlier, we are focused on continuing to strengthen our best-in-class video experience, to grow incremental revenue streams and to maximize our core pay-TV business while making strategic investments for future growth.","Thank you all for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. Now we'll open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess the first one for Charlie, if I can. With SoftBank and Sprint talking about high volumes of data over the Clearwire spectrum and cable WiFi coverage expanding over time, did your wireless effort -- did you envision that look less attractive than it did sort of 2 to 5 years ago when you started talking about it, or has it become even more important as you look to push against cable?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. Certainly, from when we started looking at it really 6 years ago, it is quite a bit more important for any number of reasons. But the first are the macro trends. The data usage is growing in exponential rates, and that looks to continue in the foreseeable future, particularly in -- with the growth of video, which is going to be the biggest use of that. So -- and the technology improvements and the amount of additional bandwidth that's available can't keep up with that demand curve as we see it. So spectrum, in fact, has become more valuable. The second thing is, is that working with the FCC, we're able to now have the option to convert our spectrum to downlink spectrum. And downlink spectrum, in the old days, everything was synchronous, right, because all our voice calls were synchronous. We talked as much as we talked up as we talked down. But now, the ratios have materially changed where there can be 6, 8, 10 to 1 downlink more than uplink. So downlink spectrum is more in demand. So to give you an example, we have as much nationwide spectrum -- or virtually the same nationwide spectrum today on the downlink side as Verizon does, and they have 100 million customers on their network. And our spectrum gets even better because we're in 20 -- we have 2 20-megahertz blocks. And of course, with LTE, the 20-megahertz block is the sweet spot because that's maximum throughput you can get in the LTE technology. And then from there, it's nationwide. So that means you get the same frequency nationwide. So you're not all chopped up like a quilt with some PCS frequency, some AWS frequency, some 700, some [indiscernible]. It's all chopped up. Ours is nationwide in singular frequency. And finally, it's a virgin frequency, which means that any new technology or any new use, you can put on that network from scratch, you can design it from scratch. And technology is changing in how you use spectrum. It also changes in how you'd use your core and how much smarts you put on the tower and how you do all that. And when you enter the marketplace with our spectrum, you're able to do that in a more efficient manner. And -- because 5G is not backward compatible to 4G, and 4G is not backward compatible to 3G, and 3G is not backward compatible to 2G and EDGE and GPRS, and all the different technologies and hodgepodge of these things out there. So the spectrum is very unique, and so it's more valuable. And I think that -- if I had to -- if I think there's one place that analysts get it wrong and the marketplace gets it wrong is probably in valuing in our spectrum. The good news for you is that it's going to be valued for you in the sense that there's another auction probably coming up probably in the fall for AWS-3 spectrum. And that AWS-3 spectrum is adjacent to our spectrum. So it's a very similar spectrum to the spectrum we have today, and it'll be 25 megahertz of downlink spectrum in that auction. And realize, we own 50 megahertz of downlink spectrum. So you're going to get a pretty good market comparable in that auction for what our spectrum is worth. And so I would say it's materially more valuable. WiFi is going to continue to have -- there will be more public spectrum available. It's going to continue to have problems in terms of propagation, interference, and you're never protected with the quality of service and the consistency of service that you want to give your customers. And of course, it's not going to be ubiquitous. It'll help, and there are certainly strategic things that cable and other people will be able to do with it. But it's not going to replace the need for your own licensed spectrum so that you can give a quality service to customers. So that's a long-winded answer, but I think that we may be wrong. But we'll have a better feel for the value of our spectrum from a financial point of view probably later this year. But I think it will be materially different than what people are analyzing.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That helps. And as you think about the business differentiation, it sounds like you don't believe that having a product out there, using all the spectrum are going to any less differentiated today than it would have been 3, 4 years ago when you envisioned it.","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I think that -- we saw the world change in 6 years ago into several different technologies, right? We had the home covered on a nationwide basis, but there were things such as broadband. There was something called OTT that was starting to be used around the world, and then there was mobile. And all those things have to come together, and they come together in the ecosystem of communications. And it's not just about a pay-TV subscription or a subscription for a mobile -- a number of minutes or number of gigabytes, right, gigabit. So it's really about how the whole ecosystem works, whether it be a subscription, whether it be advertising. The advertising model completely changes with OTT and mobile because you have one-to-one connections for the most part, which means your major advertising is totally focused on a person. And you have big databanks now. You have Big Data, so you know a lot about that customer, and so you're able to put a meaningful ad to that customer. Advertisers will pay more for that. And that infrastructure has to be put in place, and no one company has all those things. And we start thinking about how you could do that and you -- to do that, you're going to need -- you have to work with programmers and develop an OTT product and an OTT ecosystem. Obviously, we've done that with several programmers, with the largest being Disney. So that's where -- we're working really hard at that. And you need a mobile platform to get it out to people, and we have spectrum that will allow us to do that. And of course, you need mostly downlink spectrum for that. And you also are going to need a broadband service. And that's probably the one weak link that we have in the sense that we really only play in the satellite broadband market today, which is more of a niche market, perhaps 5 million homes potentially in the United States. We're working with fixed wireless, which I think would add another 30 million homes economically. And then you have the backdrop of Comcast and Time Warner in the cable industry which have a virtual monopoly on the broadband side. So how all that comes together will be for the regulators and for us to weave our way through that. But we are well positioned strategically and financially for the changes that are going to develop.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two for Charlie. The first one, do you -- just curious if you see strategic or financial rationale of an AT&T and DIRECTV combination, especially given that DIRECTV doesn't have spectrum.","Charles W. Ergen","I do see a financial -- I mean, this is from -- I'm not the expert here, and I haven't looked at it from an AT&T perspective in detail. But there certainly is economic rationale for an AT&T, DIRECTV or an acquisition of DIRECTV by AT&T because I think it would be accretive, very high price, materially higher than even DIRECTV is selling for today. That could be an accretive transaction for them. And if the reports are true that DIRECTTV has hired bankers, to perhaps shock the company, AT&T would be -- and some other companies would be crazy not to look at DIRECTV. It's a really good company, and it's got really good financial metrics. It probably makes little less sense strategically because they don't buy long-term strategic -- they buy you some strategy, but they don't buy you what you really need to probably compete with where the industry is going. But certainly from a financial point, it makes a lot of sense, and they'd be crazy not to look at it.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And if this does happen, do you see your options changing, whether it be in wireless or pay-TV or even dishNET?","Charles W. Ergen","Not really. I mean, I think it puts us -- in many ways puts us in a stronger position if that were to happen because it allows our spectrum to go in a way that would be detrimental to some people and beneficial to others. And so I think it -- I think we're just well positioned depending on how a thing goes. I do think that strategically, how we look -- we're a small telecommunications company. We don't get to -- there's 2 things we don't get to control, which is we don't have the kind of money to go outbid Sprint for T-Mobile or outbid AT&T for DIRECTV. And so we're -- we have to be well positioned so that no matter what happens, it's all good for us, and I think we're there. And secondly, Washington will make rules and regulations and merger approvals and things and decisions that will affect us, and they'll pick winners and losers. And the good news is that the administration and the FCC have talked a lot about competition and being in favor of competition. And that would be good for DISH because we like to compete. The negatives would be that there are some headwinds there. The Time Warner, Comcast merger is unprecedented concentration of power, particularly in broadband, and that would certainly raise concerns. And some of the comments on net neutrality where there might be a charge for a fast lane would totally change the dynamics of the industry. And we're hopeful that perhaps the Chairman's comments were misunderstood, and we'll get more detail on where the FCC is headed on that. But that would be a concern. And so based on the kind of things that come out of Washington could drive us to one direction or another. I'll give another example. One other example is the upcoming auction for AWS-3. We had fought really hard for interoperability. That would have made that spectrum more valuable to DISH because we've been interoperable with AWS-1 and AWS-3s. Our AWS-4 spectrum would have been inoperable. We weren't able to get that through the commission, so that's a negative for us from an auction perspective. So we've had some things that are positive. The old downlink is a big positive for us. The H-Block auction is successfully completed since last we talked. That's a big option -- positive for us. And then we have some things like potentially net neutrality, Comcast, Time Warner and interoperability that didn't go so well for us. So that drives us in certain directions depending on what happens. And we really have no control over those things other than to go make our positions known and try to work with the officials and staffs.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. I have one follow-up. It feels like over the years, you've kind of you've gotten your building blocks in order from a spectrum perspective. After the AWS-3 auction, would you say that you have all your building blocks at that point?","Charles W. Ergen","I think we're going know exactly where we stand. I think you're going to know what the value -- we will know what the value of our spectrum because somebody would have bought like spectrum in the open market, so we'll know what the value is. We will know we have -- we think we will have critical mass of spectrum. We think we have that today. And there'll be one more final auction, which will be the incentive auction. That could happen as early as 2015, and that would be something else that would be of interest potentially to us. But I think we'll know where the -- we'll know where we stand. And there's one more piece to that in the sense that the spectrum screen is expected to come out next week in terms of how much spectrum a company can own. And that looks like that screen is going to be increased materially in over 200 megahertz that a company can own. So that's interesting because that probably shows a roadmap for what future consolidation can happen within the spectrum community. So we'll have to wait and see what that says officially. But all I can say is we have -- I think we have most of the building blocks we need even without the next auction. But that can only be -- that can only be helpful because it sets a floor on the value of our spectrum and strategically places us -- there'll be winners and losers in an auction. And winners will be happy, and the losers won't have a lot of places to go. So I don't see how that hurts us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","I just want to follow up on that question. Assuming DT is just unwilling to move forward with Sprint, then you're not really having to bid against Sprint for T-Mobile. So does T-Mobile have any interest to you as far as a strategic partnership, or would you rather just wait for the spectrum screen to show people the roadmap and maybe have some of those other opportunities take place? And conversely by the way, if they do, in fact, try and they fail in that attempt to get approval for that transaction, does T-Mobile hold any value for you as a partner, acquisition target, whatever?","Charles W. Ergen","I think that -- I think T-Mobile is Sprint's to make a decision on, and we wouldn't -- just can't compete in that process. They'd have a lot of synergy and they -- there's logic to what -- why they would want to go after T-Mobile. It looks like a tough regulatory hurdle based on what people have said, but you never -- you could go broke betting on Washington. So if, in fact, Sprint didn't proceed or was denied, then T-Mobile would have strategic interest to us, yes.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And also on the spectrum values that you referenced, how do you view the difference in value between uplink and downlink? So when you see that kind of blended number that's going to come out of the auction, how would you allocate the difference in value on uplink versus downlink?","Charles W. Ergen","The vast majority of the -- in my opinion -- and it could be literally 10 to 1 in this next auction -- the value will be on the downlink side of the spectrum for 2 reasons. One is you use a lot more downlink spectrum, so it's just inherently more valuable. And most people's networks, they do not have congestion on the uplink side except possibly in a football stadium at game time. That's about the only time, but they don't have uplink. They don't have congestion. They have congestion in the downlink. So downlink will be the biggest value. The second reason that downlink will be the biggest value is the uplink spectrum in the upcoming auction is impaired and it has a lot of technical issues that have to be cleared before anyone could use that spectrum. And we think -- we haven't seen the rules on it. We haven't seen where NTIA has given us some road map there. But it looks like it could be 5 to 10 years before you could use that uplink spectrum. And so I think you -- I think for the -- it's almost as simple as take the value of that auction and multiple -- multiply it by 2, and that's a value of DISH's spectrum. So what the marketplace is saying is that auction on the paired spectrum, that, that auction is going to go somewhere between $5 million to $10 million. And I think the minimum reserve price will be higher than that, so [indiscernible]. I think the analysts -- I think analysts just have that part wrong in their analysis, but that's my personal opinion.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Right. And in that case, for that auction, you're saying the uplink is the interference on that paired spectrum. So if the net number comes out like $1, then the downlink -- the respective downlink value is obviously much more than your typical 4 to 1 ratio on usage?","Charles W. Ergen","I mean, if it was $1, it would be probably $0.90 for the downlink and $0.10 for the uplink, or $0.95 for the downlink and $0.05 for the uplink. That's -- again that's -- I'm not as knowledgeable about what other players would want uplink for, but that would be my view.","Thomas A. Cullen","And Walt, this is Tom. Let me just clarify. It's not necessarily an interference issue. It's that, that spectrum is currently occupied by several federal agencies. So the NTIA has to coordinate the clearance of that, which will take some time.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Right, got it. So timing of availability of spectrum, okay. And I...","Charles W. Ergen","I just remembered Economics 101. And as a freshman in college and there was something called supply and demand. And there's a lot of demand for downlink. There's an oversupply of uplink relatively.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And [indiscernible] wants to hop on for a quick one, too.","Unknown Analyst","Charlie, the PSS [ph] that you signed with Disney seems to be a paradigm shift moving from household-based video delivery to per stream video delivery. Just wondering if there's anything you can give us in terms of how you think about this changing the video landscape overall as you move from signing up a whole household to just signing up me, and whether this can be television-based or this has to be tablet or mobile phone-based. What are the restrictions or limitations on what you can and can't do with this as you kick it off later this year?","Charles W. Ergen","Okay. It's really a big picture, which was really Disney was our worst relationship with a programmer. And I hope that Disney is now our best relationship, and what -- we realized the industry is changing and that there's -- that there can be more economics to our content providers. And while some people think we're against advertising, we're actually probably more pro-advertising than anybody other than the network broadcasters. And so OTT, in a sense, is an experiment that they're willing to go make -- they have kind of set the rules for that. Now as they're leading -- as a result of them leading, they're setting the rules of that. And the rules are pretty smart I think on their part in the sense that we're going to be able to go to people on a one-to-one relationship and give them more of a slimmed-down version of content that people -- primarily aimed at people who aren't paying for content today. Or if they're paying for content, it's going to Netflix. It's not going to the current programming partners. The second part of it is that we also are going to experiment a lot in the advertising realm in the sense that we believe that we can increase the advertising to our programming partners by getting higher -- when you take the data that we have and the data that they have and you put that together, we can go to a customer in a way that we otherwise couldn't go to them with particular ads. So we're going to know that you had -- we know you have a car for 8 years. Or we know that you went online to look at a car. We can download a car ad to you instead of downloading a car ad to you when you just bought a car last week. That doesn't any make any sense, right? We can download movie trailers on Thursday night because you're more likely to go -- and Friday night because you're more likely to go to the movie on Friday night or Saturday night. We don't have to download that trailer on Sunday night when we know you're not going to a movie on Monday. And so we can do a lot of things that increase the revenue pie to our programming partners, but also increase the revenue to us. And it's not a zero-sum game. The hardest thing about a programming negotiation today is every $0.01 we pay Disney is $0.01 out of our pocket and $0.01 -- it's $0.01 we got to charge customers. But in the advertising model, it's a win-win situation. And so that allows us to do some things that are different. And I think that we have to work with Disney and other programmers to make this a product and share our results and try to make it a product that's economical for where things are going. I believe it's also a precursor to mobile. Every part of infrastructure that we put in place for OTT is exactly the infrastructure we need for mobile. And for mobile, the advertising is even better. Because in mobile, we're going to a smart device and we're going to know your physical location and we're going to make it interactive and we're going to -- we have your credit card information. And the ads are, in fact, interactive. They're not static ads. The world of static ads isn't going to make much sense in the future. And so the ads are going to ask you to do something, and that's going to be a more valuable ad for advertisers. And again, with mobility, you need airwaves, you spectrum and so we're well positioned there. So it's all part of a kind of 2-step process to OTT and mobility that we believe makes programming partners a lot more money than they make today. So there's only 2 ways to make money in this business. One is you own the content, and the other is you own the distribution. And we're a distribution company. We're not a content company. So we're not a 2-headed monster between content and distribution. We're just a distribution company. And for those programming partners who want to work with us, we're going to make them more money and then we're -- right, by getting them more eyeballs and more advertising revenue. And we're going to make ourselves more money because it's going to go through our pipes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just want to continue on the PSS [ph] Disney agreement for either Charlie or Joe. There's been a lot written about what else needs to be done to get this off the ground from a contract perspective. I don't know if you would talk to that. But if not, how confident are you, you can actually launch a product this year? And how do you make money, Charlie, at $30 of ARPU, which I think is at least what the press has talked about? And how big is the market? Disney just seems to describe it as for the broadband-only homes, cord-nevers, whatever catchphrase or buzzword you want to use. But when you look at the economic opportunity here, how do you make money at $30? Do you have a truck roll, and how big is the market?","Charles W. Ergen","I'll take other the first part of that, and if Joe wants to jump in. First of all, we don't know if we make money at it. But we think that the -- we think the money -- that the SAC is materially less because, obviously, you wouldn't necessarily have to have a truck roll. It can be a self -- if you have a smart TV or Chrome or Roku box or Kindle Fire. You don't need us to roll a truck [ph]. It can be immediate. So if you order it, we can give it to you immediately because it will be -- you will have to be online to use it. And it goes to a smaller niche of people. I think that we're in agreement with Disney on that in terms of how we approach the marketplace. And we're trying to getting incremental revenue, we're not trying to go change the system that we have today with a person having 4 TVs in their house and trying to convert them to this. So I think -- and I think there's a bigger advertising data component of this that we can monetize in a way that we're not able to do as well on satellite. We have mostly national commercials, so those go at a lower CPM than a local commercial, right, might be 5, 6, 7, 8 to 1 more for a local commercial. But not only are we -- we're going to be able to do local commercials. We're going to be able to do commercials down to address the house or the location of the person. So that will increase those CPMs. It's a benefit to both of us. And then, finally, we have enough programming contracts to launch this service now, but we don't anticipate we would launch before the end of the year. It's that kind of -- there have been reports of maybe earlier, but I think the end of the year to come out with a product that works. And we certainly have a few more spots for the programmers if they so choose to. So we're comfortable launching with what we have and think it's still a meaningful product, but we think that there's a few other programmers that would like to experiment with this. And this can take a bit -- we have to do -- invent some technology on how to insert ads and how to monitor the data. There's a few things we have to invent that's going to take us some time. So we're looking at something by the end of the year. Joe...","Joseph P. Clayton","Just to follow up on that. I mean, the pay-TV in this industry itself today, the entire industry, is missing this key customer segment. Let's call it the young adult market, for lack of a better word, from, say, like 18 to 35. And we do know that they're young. They're well-educated. They're mostly urban dwellers. And they are not going to spend $100 per month for their video content. Maybe they'll spend the $20, $30 that you mentioned. We know they're not going to watch 250 channels. They might watch 20, 30, so it will be a smaller offering of channels. And we know they're not going to watch it on a 60-inch, 62-inch flat-panel display, they're going to watch on their tablets, PCs or smartphones. So even though there may be a potential of some cannibalization to our existing satellite TV business, we believe the majority of this will be incremental because we're missing it today. So that's kind of a market look at it.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Two if I could, one following up on the OTT offering. Do you need hardware in the home to do this? You mentioned they're going to be watching on tablets and PC screens and phones and the like, but does this require a set-top box for you, or can you get away with just having clients on other third-party devices, the Rokus or Amazon Fire or Xboxes and the like of the world? And secondly, thoughts on integrating other OTT providers into your core DISH DVS offering, such as having Netflix as an option in your box and search across multiple platforms?","Charles W. Ergen","You got -- you don't have to have a separate piece of hardware. I mean, I shouldn't say it, you have to have a smart TV or you have to have a way to connect to the Internet, whether it be smart TV, or whether it be Chrome or whether it be a Roku or Kindle Fire. You could have a separate box and you could do a lot of interesting things with that box in terms of graphics and an operating system. But it can work on game players, game consoles, too. So for the most part, customers may already have the devices. And the second part of the question was...","Joseph P. Clayton","Other providers.","Charles W. Ergen","Oh, I think that's a strategic call that I don't think that we've made a decision on it, but you have 2 choices it of being a closed platform or you can be an open platform. Open platform probably, at the end of the day, is more consumer friendly, but probably a little bit more disadvantageous to our current business. So those are -- we haven't made decisions on that yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from to Vijay Jayant with ISI.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just continuing on this new OTT offering, Charlie, can you talk about digital ad insertion environment. How does that -- is going to be shared with the content guys? Is it similar to the current splits or there's a new economic model developing there? But also just strategically, when you're creating this new offering and you said it's going to be a niche product, what is that niche that this offering could sort of take from the current ecosystem and you can gain share? We thought it would be sort of non-sports, but now you've got some of the best sporting channels from the Disney platform. So any help on just where the opportunity would be there?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, I mean, I think that the advertising model will be -- it will be similar the way it is today. We have minutes -- we normally have minutes as a multichannel provider, and the programming partner has minutes. We're certainly open to sharing our data with our partners, so that we -- they can place ads in a way that will be more meaningful to them and they make more money. We don't see help -- we see helping our partners as a positive, not a negative. Obviously -- so the model will just be higher CPMs as we get scale. It will take a while to get scale. But we'll have real data. I mean, the world of TV was pretty obsolete. If you think about world of TV 30 years ago, you had 4 channels to watch, and you didn't had a -- you had a scrolling guide, if you had a guide. And TV ads are all static and they just play. The world today is that you can interact with that ad. You can buy something. You can get information quickly. You can -- you have plenty of channels to go and your biggest problem is finding out what to watch. And so we have to look of that paradigm and say, \"Let's put a product in there that makes sense, right?\" People aren't going to come home and say, \"I want to watch Comedy Central.\" They're going to come home and say, \"I want to watch The Daily Show.\" But they're not going to go come home at 9:00 when it's on, they're going to come home at 10:00 and then watch the next day or so forth. So how do you go do all those things? Do you really need to watch Shark Week on Discovery during Shark Week, or maybe you want to watch it when your kids are studying sharks in school, right? So that changes everything, and OTT allows us to give a better product to the customer. The advertising -- I will predict that the advertising will be -- someday will be huge. And when you add mobility to it, the advertising revenue between OTT and mobility will be much greater than the broadcasting or the programming people get today. Right? So the future of advertising will dwarf what they're getting today. That'd just be a different system. And we can put our head in the sand or we can go out and -- we can go obsolete ourself. And we've obsoleted ourself before as a company when we went from big dishes to little dishes. And we're willing to obsolete ourself by going to the next generation of where this thing is going, which is in-home and at-home, fixed OTT and mobile. And it would be malpractice not to do that because then, we would be stuck as a -- then we'd be the wireline business. I mean, we'd be a twisted-pair copper that does voice, and a business that would be declining at 4%, 5% a year. And that's just not what we chose to do. History will prove us right or wrong. I think the jury's out.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Back to the M&A and, Charlie, following up on your spectrum screen comments, it looks like -- our math suggests AT&T has a little over 130 megahertz per market. You guys have are about 54. I mean, given the new spectrum screen and 200 megahertz that you mentioned, I mean, in your mind, as you read the tea leaves, is there anything that would prevent AT&T from buying you guys? I mean, it seems like that would be a better fit, given the fact with what you just talked about and the need to move to sort of nontraditional video. And I guess following up on that, the other side of that transaction, DIRECTV, with your new OTT product and others coming, I mean, how does that impact potential combination between DISH and DIRECTV as you see going forward, at least from a regulatory standpoint?","Charles W. Ergen","From a spectrum screen perspective, the only -- I think AT&T, Verizon or T-Mobile could buy DISH or vice versa.","Joseph P. Clayton","If the rules go.","Charles W. Ergen","If the rules are what people -- right, we haven't seen the rules, so -- Sprint, if the rules are what we think they're going to be, then Sprint probably couldn't buy us without having to give up some spectrum, right? Or we couldn't buy Sprint without having to give up spectrum. The DIRECTV -- DISH, I mean, obviously, that would be, from a transaction point of view, that'd be the highest synergy transaction that DISH could do. But would -- and it potentially would face some regulatory headwinds depending on how they come down on Comcast, Time Warner. But it's certainly a different landscape than it was 11 years ago when we tried it. But the other part of it, I think, that all those things that you -- all those potential transactions, it ultimately boils down to economics in price. And so I think the -- our board, I don't think, would be inclined to do something with the valuation of DISH that didn't include the true value of our technology, our spectrum, our management and everything else. I mean, I think we are well positioned for the future, and we put long-term things in place to the detriment of a short-term stock price. And so I mean, as example, I think that DIRECTV would be too frothy for us to for our board look at those kinds of prices. It makes all the sense in the world, but you're not going to give up 2\/3 of the synergy to another company that you believe you're better positioned than. So that just -- that's look to be too frothy, but it doesn't make -- it could make a lot of sense for AT&T or Verizon or somebody else that has a different motivation because it's very accretive. So...","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Charlie, 2 quick questions. First, you said categorically in the past that you would not separate the spectrum from your core satellite business. Is that still the case that there's sort of a categorical view that if you were going to do a transaction for the spectrum, it would have to include the whole company? And then separately, just a clarification on the Disney deal. As I understand it, that yield does not include the typical obligations to carry other -- all the other suites of programming. Can you just put any detail around that as to how much additional programming from other programmers it does require, and what your vision would be for how broad that offering would be when you go to market?","Charles W. Ergen","Okay. I'll take the second part first. We're not going to give -- talk about the details of the Disney deal other than to say that we have enough programming contracts in-house today to launch the service. So that's not going to be a stumbling block in terms of -- it is much narrower -- it is a much smaller -- it's a skinny-down version of pay-TV targeted at a different class of people. But we don't believe we're getting or Disney's getting today. There's certainly -- we'll certainly reevaluate with Disney and other partners as we go along and do the right thing long-term as it moves forward. So it's not going to be -- this is going to be groundbreaking material, huge thing in 2014. It's just the precursor to where I think industry is going and certainly the precursor to where we think we're going with mobile. So it's just that it's getting out and going -- it'd be like doing broadband back in 1998. I mean this is -- this is dial-up, and now we're supposed to be broadband. We'll get -- the OTT will be similar. It's going to move in directions we can't foresee. I don't think we've ever said we'd categorically wouldn't split up our spectrum, but certainly, our preference would not be to take a strategic asset that we worked on for 6 years and then split off of for profit, pay taxes on the profit and then be back to just DISH Network and what we view as a mature business and potentially a declining business, right? We think that the spectrum is an integral part of where DISH Network needs to go and -- that those -- that the best value to our shareholders is keeping those things linked, right? And as you mature in the satellite side of the business, you're able to bring -- you're able to combine the mobile side and the OTT side into an ecosystem that, when you put it all together, has tremendous value.","Operator","We will now take our final question from the analyst community. [Operator Instructions] We will begin the media portion of this call following the answer to this final analyst question. Our final analyst question comes from Tom Eagan with Telsey.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Charlie, I was wondering if you could comment on the impact of some of the announced deals between Comcast and Charter? So we know that Comcast is it taking the systems on the East and the West Coast and that Charter taking systems in the central states, Ohio and Wisconsin. So for example, does that change the landscape for you guys at all?","Charles W. Ergen","I don't know if Tom may have some comments. He knows cable better than I do. But obviously, the merger itself is the biggest concern, right? Because it gives unprecedented concentration of power in broadband, and with programming and with leverage against programmers, who we had to compete against. So obviously, Comcast-Time Warner is going to get better pricing than Comcast or Time Warner alone. That means that programmers get less money. They get to pass it on. They get to pass cost onto somebody else. Where is it going to go? It's going to go to little guys, right? So that's not -- and then, of course, obviously to the extent you control the pipe to the house, and if you believe what I believe that most video, long term, is going to come through that pipe, particularly from an OTT's perspective, suddenly you have a virtual monopoly, which is very similar to where cable was before DIRECTV and DISH got to satellite business, and we're going go backward in time there. And so that's concerning. And then it gets even more concerning when you start thinking about paying for fast lane. Only the big players will be able to play. You'd never -- you'd never have a DISH Network startup in that environment. You wouldn't have a Facebook startup in that environment, or Google. I mean, it'll just be really big companies, and that's concerning. The other part of geographic concentration, I think, makes sense for the cable guys. It makes all the sense in the world because there's economies of scale and some synergy by operating in a particular geographic area. And so that just seems to be smart business on their part. It just makes them more -- that makes them more formidable as competitor, but we don't begrudge the fact that they're doing smart things.","Joseph P. Clayton","Yes. Given the marketing and operating efficiencies in local markets, like concentrating geographies, but it also improves their position in terms of the local programming, which could include RSNs. So in general, yes, of course, we're concerned about Comcast-Time Warner, just the sheer scale of the entity, the dominance in broadband and the potential for very disruptive bundling are all things that concern us.","So we'll take in, what, media questions now?","Jason Kiser","Okay. That concludes the...","Joseph P. Clayton","Yes, thanks everybody. We're going to media now.","Jason Kiser","Okay. That concludes our Q&A with the financial analysts, and thank you all for joining the call. We have a little more time for questions from the media.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first media question comes from Liana Baker with Reuters.","Liana Baker","Just a follow-up for Charlie about a comment you made before. Could you elaborate on your comment about DIRECTV being too frothy at those prices? What do you mean by that?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I think the question was DISH -- would DISH look at DIRECTV, or that's how I interpreted the contract. And answer is, of course, we'd look at DIRECTV if they're for sale. Of course, we would look at them. And there would be a lot of synergy and a lot of -- that would make a lot of sense from our perspective because there'll be just a ton of synergy between the 2 companies, right? Anyway, there's probably no deal that DISH could do that wouldn't have that -- that would have that kind of synergy. But we'd also have to be realistic about valuations. And the price levels that they would be at today, based on the relative value to where we think we are, would probably be a kind of a nonstarter for us because we just -- we would view -- I don't want to talk for DIRECTV, but I think they might be very skeptical of where we are on wireless spectrum and what the real value of that is. They wouldn't really know how to value that, right? Hell, the marketplace doesn't know how to market -- value that today, right? The valuations are all over -- are $5 billion, $10 billion apart, right? So nobody really knows how to value that. So that made it very difficult for them to say it. They would probably say Dish is overvalued because they're getting value for -- All we can value is our subscribers. And when we look at that, we think they're are allocating too much value to their strategic position in the spectrum. We look at them another way where we'd say we're well-positioned for the future, right? We've spent 6 years investing, right? And now that we're ready to harvest our investments, we don't want to pay a value for something that's purely financial, as opposed to strategic. So we look at that and just say, for us, you guys don't need to speculate in the press about us because that seems -- we can never outbid an AT&T or a Verizon or anyone else for DIRECTV, because they would have a financial motive. And we're really holding interest in the strategic motives. So then for us the valuation is different or the analysis is different. And I think an AT&T could -- could easily pay triple digits for DIRECTV and still be accretive to them. So I -- we don't mind getting in a battle, if we got a shot to win. But we have no shot at that, right? So...","Liana Baker","What did you think of all the reports and analysts notes saying that AT&T actually is trying to smoke DISH out? What did you think of those reports?","Charles W. Ergen","Idle speculation. I mean, we're not -- we're a pretty simple company. We're a public company with a Board of Directors. There's no smoking us out, right? There's -- we have people who talk to us all the time about things, and they know how to do it. They usually call us up and then we'll have a meeting. And there's not -- smoking out some sounds like some plot for a TV sitcom or something. It's just not the way it works with us, right? It -- we're -- I mean, Tom can answer this better than I can because he heads up Corporate Development. But I think in this industry, everybody's talking to everybody, right, as you might expect. The only company that potentially seems to maybe have put themselves up for sale, if reports about them are true, it would be DIRECTV. So obviously, that makes a lot of sense for people to talk to them. Because if they hired bankers you know who to go to, you just go the bankers to have a conversation. DISH is just a public company where we have conversations with everybody. And sometimes those conversations are about acquiring another company, sometimes it's about merging companies. Sometimes they're about selling companies. Sometimes they're about joint ventures. And it's 1-800 DISH. It's not like you're going to negotiate it on the front page of The Wall Street Journal. That doesn't make any sense.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Moritz from Bloomberg.","Scott Moritz","Charlie, the question -- maybe you can help us think about this. There've been kind of a chain reaction deals since Comcast-Time Warner, talks of deals between DIRECTV and AT&T. And you say you still have very good options. What would be your options if those deals all came together?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I think the same things it's always have been, which is in the goalpost, if we can build a network out ourself, that's not likely, but that certainly, with changes in technology and verge in spectrum and the fact that we have more downlink and uplink, there's ways you can go about doing that. On the other end of the spectrum, we might sell the company, right? And then there's everything in between, which is whether we would merge with somebody, acquire somebody, partner with somebody and so forth and so on. And in any transaction, there's winners and losers, right? So Comcast-Time Warner, there's a lot of losers on the sidelines for that one, right? Comcast and Time Warner, and I think their shareholders will be winners on that one, assuming they get regulatory approval and there's not conditions that -- the conditions aren't very strong and they can be a monopoly, they're going to be winners, right? But the problem is everybody has to compete against them. It's losers, right? And potentially, the American consumers are losers. So how do you then put together things that would be beneficial to American consumers and beneficial to shareholders? And AT&T and DIRECTV might be one of those chain reactions. But there would be others and you can use your imagination on what would be for me to talk out of school, but you could use your imagination on.","Scott Moritz","All right. A follow-up on that. Is DISH prepared to oppose the Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal?","Charles W. Ergen","We haven't -- we're going to read all those stuff and we'll make a decision. But we're not opposed to being opposed to something if it's not the right thing to do. I mean, I think we will have a strong opinion on how it would affect our business and how it will affect the American consumer. And if the condition was that they had to do wholesale pricing like it's done in other countries, we might think that might be good for consumers, right? So we -- that might not be good for us, but we might not oppose it if it was good for consumers. If it's allowed to be -- to charge for a fast lane and be an unregulated monopoly, that would probably be that the consumers and bad for our business and we'd probably oppose it. So we'll just have to wait and see. But we very rarely win in Washington. So we're going to be a small -- a little small voice in this big, big merger, and there'll be other much bigger voices than ours. But we will have an opinion and we participate in the political process, and we will participate in this kind of groundbreaking potential merger.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Sherman with Bloomberg.","Alex Sherman","Charlie, given DIRECTV and AT&T are in fact talking about a deal, which we have reason to believe is the case, with the Time Warner Cable-Comcast merger and Sprint's potentially trying to do a deal with T-Mo, my question for you is, are we reaching the last episode of Seinfeld here? Is the endgame near? Are we hitting a point where DISH is going to have to make a large transitional loom or do you feel like your options still leave you with years of runway ahead of you.","Charles W. Ergen","If all those things happen, then we'll evaluate that particular condition. But it -- the only thing I can give you is, I'm not that smart, but when I used to play poker and everybody was throwing chips and betting crazy on the table and I had really good cards, I always felt it was better just to sit back and watch them go at it, right? And every time they went at it, I'd learned something. And they -- and as I sat back, they didn't learn anything about what I had. And I learned to trust my cards. And I wasn't a very good poker player, but when a bunch of drunken fools were throwing money around, occasionally I was able to pick up a pot at the end of the day. So it's crazy how eerily similar it seems to me today with this crazy stuff on the press and everybody is kind of gone -- wild swings in the market. And it just seems to me to be kind of similar, and it seems to me that my recommendations to our board would probably let's it all -- let's see what all happens. Because we know, we know that there's an auction coming up that will tell us kind of what our value is. And strategically, that auction is going to tell us whether we have a better hand or a worse hand. And why not wait and see? But is there anything that I've read about that would -- I'd worry about? No. I mean, all those scenarios, if they all happen, I wouldn't worry as a shareholder of DISH. And it's probably unlikely that all those things happen in a way that the press is reporting. It's -- it always happens a different way. It just never -- the movie always has a twist and Seinfeld always has a twist. And it never happens exactly the way you think it is. And I don't think it -- even the way I think things are going to happen, isn't going to be the way it's going to happen. So that means that you want to have -- you want to get good cards as you can and you want to keep getting cards and you want to wait and see until it's all out there, and then you make your move. I don't know how to explain strategy other than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Gryta with Wall Street Journal.","Thomas Gryta","You talked about not being able to outbid for DIRECTV and about the financial side of that, but do you think you could get it pass regulators, and what would be your case for that?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I guess I would be cautiously optimistic. You could get it through regulators. I think you'd have to show them that you're -- that as a result of the merger, competition would be enhanced. That from a big picture perspective, competition would be enhanced, not eliminated or concentrated. And a more -- a stronger DISH, DIRECTV, in the wake of a Comcast-Time Warner charter consolidation, new entrants in the marketplace, OTT and concentration and broadband, is probably not a bad thing for consumers. And I think you could probably make that case. What was the other part of the question? I mean, you -- but it wouldn't be a sure thing by any means. You'd have to have -- you'd have to really -- you'd have to spend some time with the regulators and make your case. And they only have to decide yes or no. And we don't know what we're going to decide on Comcast-Time Warner right now. So -- right? I mean, I don't think it's a [indiscernible] to complete. I don't think that -- I think people are afraid to talk about it because everybody has to deal with Comcast. But it's -- that's got serious consequences to the future of telecommunications and content and everything else in the United States. That's a big merger. It would not be the one -- it would not be a merger that typically would sail through Washington, let's put it that way. Even though, obviously, they're very well connected.","Thomas Gryta","Do you think it would be helpful to get a DIRECTV-DISH deal in front of regulators, while they're considering the cable merger?","Charles W. Ergen","I would say, strategically, that probably would make more sense so that you -- because I think people would understand the fairness of that, and you probably either would approve both of them or you would disapprove both of them. But I think people would understand the fairness of them. If they can go to 30 million subs and higher, somebody else ought to be able to go to 30 million subs, too. That's the dangerous catalyst that potentially happens. But we can -- we're small guys, we can't afford DIRECTV.","Operator","Your last question comes from Ryan Nakashima with Associated Press.","Ryan Nakashima","Charlie, I wanted to ask you, you said that you have enough programming contracts now for an OTT service. Could you expand on that? I mean, do you have like enough broadcasters, enough range of programming to effectively market to this niche that you look at?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, the -- I mean to say, we wouldn't launch with Disney channels alone, so we'd want to have enough critical mass between general entertainment and sports and children's to launch, and we think we have that to do that. Although I would say that I think Disney, by itself, is a pretty good compelling content to the niche that we're going after. I mean, were not going to launch with just Disney, but I wouldn't be opposed to doing that because there's an awful lot of people who love their sports or have kids, or love sports and have kids, that don't -- can't pay $100 a month. So -- and we're not getting those customers today and Disney's not getting those customers today. And the cord-cutter stuff is not this dramatic thing we're suddenly -- the video business is a mature business, but it's hanging in there pretty well, based on the first quarter numbers. And it appears that's going to hang in there for a period of time. But it's a bit like the lobster that gets boiled, right, the old analogy, which is you don't really know you're dead and boiled until too late. And DISH is just a company that would rather be upfront and make some mistakes, and be ahead of the curve than be behind the curve, because then you're at the -- then you can't shape your vision of what you think is important. So we may be a little ahead of our skis here and so forth, but -- and I don't think -- so OTT is not going to move the needle for anybody this year. It's probably not going to move the needle next year. There's a lot of programmers who are not interested in it yet, or would have unreasonable demands that it wouldn't make sense to do it. But I'm very comfortable with the content we have today. That if we can get our systems all ready to go by the end of year, then we would launch with what we have. And there's probably several others that will -- probably several others that will participate just because they're pretty creative and they're looking for long term. But if we do, we'll announce it.","Jason Kiser","All right. Thanks, everybody.","Charles W. Ergen","Sorry for monopolizing everything today, but I guess it was...","Joseph P.

Welcome to the DISH Network's Q1, 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be listen-only mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jason Kiser. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Kiser","Thank you, and thanks for joining us everybody. I am joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman; Erik Carlson, our CEO; Brian Neylon, President of DISH; Warren Schlichting, the President of Sling, Paul Orban, our Chief Accounting Officer; and Tim Messner, our General Counsel. Ordinarily Tom Cullen would be in the room with us but he is traveling out of country this week so, unable to make the call.","I think Erik and Paul have some prepared remarks but before we do that, Tim need to do the Safe Harbor Statement first.","Tim Messner","All right, thank you Jason, good morning everyone. Statements that we make during this call that are not statements of historical facts constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and\/or from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings.","All cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as being applicable to any forward-looking statements we make wherever they appear. You should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings and should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which we assume no responsibility for updating.","As part of the process for SEC, auction 1 and 2, we've filed an application to potentially participate as a bidder for those spectrum assets. Because of the SEC's anti-collision rules we will not be answering any questions about the auction during today's call.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Erik Carlson.","Erik Carlson","Thank you, Tim and good morning everyone. Both Paul and I have a few remarks before we open it up to Q&A. On the wireless front, we're tracking to complete by March of next year our Phase 1 build out, and our performance team is busy this spring as we continue to install towers across the nation. Charlie is here for questions on wireless.","In the quarter, we really remained committed to our strategy of delivering the best service, technology, and value to our customers. The key customer benefits are a way for us to standout and really a challenged linear TV environment in our view will attract loyal, high quality, and profitable subscribers. Service is a constant priority for us, and I want to take a moment to congratulate our in-home service technicians. Look, these folks really have a tough job 365 days a year. Our last quarter for the second year in a row, our in-home service team earned the second -- the highest score in a segment from JD Power for in-home customer satisfaction. So, I just want to thank our techs for the work you do with our customers every day. But our focus on the overall customer experience like delivering excellent in-home service has really yielded consistent result. In the quarter, we reported a monthly churn rate for DISH TV of 1.74% which compares to the year-ago period of 1.47.","With that said, a few comments on programming, first on Univision. After months of work to find a deal that'd be fair to all parties and in particular for our customers, we announced an agreement with Univision at the end of the quarter. That hard work was on behalf of our customers and the Hispanic community that we've served for more than 20 years, and we continue to serve with quality content at the right value. Univision has been a good long-term partner. I appreciate the work the new management team did to help us reach an agreement.","With regard to HBO and AT&T, there is nothing new to report. We recently met again with AT&T, but unfortunately they only offered different words with really the same meaning. AT&T wants their subscribers to pay for HBO whether they want the channel or not, and AT&T continued this anti-competitive behavior by really forcing a lose-lose towards our customers, switch to AT&T's platform or have us subsidize HBO, so AT&T can give it away free to its customers. Our view hasn't changed. AT&T stance remains one of the fundamental negatives of the merger with Time Warner.","Now, as we've indicated in the past, churn attribution is not a perfect sign. There's lots of factors that go into it. Looking at the first quarter, it's fair to say that together, HBO and Univision accounted for something a little less than half of our net sub loss.","I'll wrap up with a quick look at Sling. We continue to grow our Sling subscriber base and continue to lead the live OTT category. While the rest of the marketplace is in turmoil regarding pricing and position, we remain focused, focused on delivering a great experience, meaningful value, unique flexibility, and category-leading stability. Ad sales in the Sling in the first quarter nearly doubled year-over-year, where we've enabled live dynamic ad insertion on more than 90 networks. We continue to see strong penetration of margin-rich add-ons like premium channels and our cloud DVR offering. With every move our competitors make, we become more differentiated, reaffirming our strategy of offering flexibility of the skinny bundle.","With that overview, I'd like to turn over to Paul who has a few brief remarks on the quarter and then we'll open it up to Q&A. Paul?","Paul Orban","Thank you, Erik. Our core Pay-TV business continues to focus on acquiring and retaining high-quality subscribers with long-term profitability. In the quarter, we adopted the new accounting standard for releases on a prospective basis. This standard requires that we record operating leases on the balance sheet, and this has resulted in an increase to both assets and liabilities of $726 million. The adoption of the new standard does not have any impact on our net income or cash flows.","Q1 operating income and EBITDA were both lower year-over-year by $73 million. This is principally due to a lower Pay-TV subscriber base. We generated free cash flow of $322 million during the quarter and we ended up the period with $2.4 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand. These amounts will be used to retire $1.3 billion of our senior notes due on September 1 of this year. Revenue declined 8% year-over-year due to fewer DISH TV subscribers. This is partially offset by a higher Pay-TV ARPU and the growth of the Sling subscriber base.","Subscriber-related expenses also decreased 8% as a result of fewer DISH TV subscribers. Programming expenses were positively impacted by the Univision and HBO channel removals. Improvement in our variable expenses continued with increases in operational efficiencies, and as a result of fewer subscribers. We've continued our focus on acquiring and retaining high-quality subscribers. Our subscriber-related margins have remained roughly flat year-over-year. Our G&A expenses increased as a result of certain litigation accruals and increase cost to support our wireless initiatives. G&A in Q1, 2018, was positively impacted by legal fee reimbursements. As a reminder, substantially all of our interest expense is being capitalized while we are building our wireless network. Much of our other spend related to the build out is also being capitalized. So, you will not see that in the P&L.","And now looking at our metrics, Pay-TV ARPU is up due to DISH TV price increase in 2019 and '18, and continuing increases in revenue per subscriber related to Sling. These increases were partially offset by a higher percentage of Sling TV subscribers present in the overall Pay-TV subscriber base. We also saw a decrease in premium channel revenue mainly related to the removal of HBO.","The Sling increase was mainly driven by a mix of three factors. First, customers taking higher priced packages. Second, increased add on revenues from extras, ad sales, and cloud DVRs, and lastly, the $5 increase on our orange package from the third quarter of 2018. DISH TV SAP increased to $828 per activation, up from $707 for activation last year. The increase in the Pay TV SAP was due to an increase in hardware cost and advertising cost per activation. Do note that year-over-year comparison -- for the year-over-year comparison, DISH TV SAP in Q1 2018 was positively impacted by the reactivation of 24000 customers in Puerto Rico at a low cost per activation. We continued to gain a greater percentage of high credit and [indiscernible] based customers in each quarter. We are continuing to invest in new customers by offering a higher percentage of our subscriber Hopper receivers which deliver a better customer experience.","With that, I will turn it over for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now take questions from the analyst community. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. A couple of questions for Charlie, Charlie, first, I think about this time last year, I asked about financing for Phase 2, you said you have potentially $10 billion to build out. And you said about this time this year I think 2019 will be the time you would start to address that, is any sort of commentary around that financing. I think the second question, Charlie, is in terms of getting the IoT wireless build out sort of done on time. And you have talked about progress towards that, from an FCC standpoint to perfect the licenses do you also need a bona fied IoT business in place? Do you need customers and marketing alike as well? Or, should we just focus on the build out itself as to what you need? And then I have got one more follow-up.","Charlie Ergen","Yes, I'll take the second part first. The terms of our flexible use license, I don't believe that it requires a service doesn't -- I know that really addresses customers, but obviously it has to be -- our intention is to build a network that is viable network and viable service, and I am hoping we will have lots of customers on the way [ph]. It's a -- it's not ideal in the sense that again we have one hand tied behind our back because we have only got 5 megahertz nationwide spectrum, which is H Block which is a nonstandard kind of frequency and not the ideal frequency for uplink and IoT network.","Obviously, we will feel better if can bring our 600 megahertz into the system. But that can't -- it has to be nationwide basis. That's not possible until that spectrum is cleared. So, -- but it will be a viable service, and we are not spiking the footfall that in terms of being done, but we are making steady progress and learning a lot and making a lot of mistakes and -- like any new business. We are focused on making sure that happens.","In terms of financing the second phase of the network, I think even your question shows kind of one of the issues we have which is the FCC is an overhang because obviously we are coming under scrutiny with the letter that they wrote to us and other things. That's an overhang in terms of perception out there. And that may not be reality but it's certainly the perception in terms of risk factor that we don't think should be there. We don't think it is there.","So, fortunately, at least for people in the home work [ph] in this quarter we saw a couple of things, one is AT&T not only announced the nationwide IoT network, I think this week or last week, which kind of takes away the argument that IoT is not in service, right? And the second thing that happened a couple of weeks ago is they actually perfected some of their licenses. I think about a dozen of their licenses they perfected those license with the FCC with IoT network as the only service that they had on it. So, there is what should be good for AT&T should be good for us. I think the argument is whether IoT as a service is probably one that some analysts have claimed that that's not under license does not allow, but I think that argument has been put to rest, but the FCC -- the government picks winners and losers. The FCC can do whatever they want. They can say that we are not there.","Having said that, so in terms of raising money, we don't need capital today for the phase one. Phase two, we clearly are going to need. We have estimated $10 billion. That can come in a lot of forms because obviously in terms of partnership we may have people contribute things that don't require cash for us but certainly realize that we are going to need to do some things there. Having said that, the story is -- the business's story is really, really good. And the business plan is getting better and better and better. And I think that ideally leave the overhand of the FCC behind us. And then we will be able to tell the story with that maybe some skepticism out there. And the people are a little bit more open minded about what we are doing, in the power of 5G and the power of standalone network and 5G. And what 5G really can do? Things aren't really obvious to people today that that's maybe more time for us and that may not be this year.","Doug Mitchelson","I appreciate all that.","Charlie Ergen","I don't know if we can stall the FCC overhang. So we build our network and meet our internal deadline that we have here and just execute.","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks for that. The follow-up is I think for the first time since you launched service you are going to have some leverage Disney with the upcoming FX and Nat Geo renewal. And given your willingness to drop HBO and Univision, I just wonder if there is horse trading that you there. Or, whether any thoughts on programming cost coming down little bit in the back half of the year following that renewal? And I guess [indiscernible] Sinclair and that might be an off-cycle deal as well, but any thoughts on programming cost in the second of the year given the unique renewal structure with Fox having merged with Disney?","Charlie Ergen","Well, I think the big picture is I think that contracts have to change in the linear business, right? You can't -- you have heard this from the AT&T CEO and the others. But you can't have double digit declines in viewership and have 6%, 7%, 8% increases in pricing when customers are watching less. That's just not sustainable. Some people are asking for more increases than that. So I think the Univision was very painful, but it was one the few contracts that we have where the incentives on both -- and the reason we ultimately came to an agreement that incentives for Univision and DISH are now very much aligned which is a bit unusual. And I think that's really way the contracts in the future should be done so that we are sharing each other's success. And to some degree so -- we have had good relationship with Disney.","Obviously, they have got now a direct consumer business. We don't understand where we fit in that strategy. We hope we understand where we fit in that strategy and to extent we fit in that strategy and we can do fair deal for our customers. That should be pretty easy because we had a -- we had such long term relationship with them to the extent that the Linear TV business is not part of their future, it might be difficult. So we just don't -- we don't know, and obviously with Sinclair, we're doing a lot of stuff with Sinclair particularly in ATS 3.0, so hopefully -- to a degree they are successful with the regional sport which could be really deal for them. And I am hopeful we can be productive and get aligned in an agreement that will be aligned for both us and that would be productive. So we are pretty easy to work with as along people look to do something that's fair and not try to take advantage of situation. I mean obviously AT&T that kind of tactic because they had the motivation. It appears their motivation really was to take our subs. So they didn't really try to present the deal that makes -- I mean they knew that we wouldn't do something utterly stupid and so they didn't put anything that must be for a reason, but they had a different motivation which was to take our subscribers.","Doug Mitchelson","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Now we will move to a question Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you. Just a couple, first is tell me from the FCC perspective just for our understanding, once you build out the network, is there a deadline for the FCC to approve or ask for changes or do anything with respect to the network, or there's no hard deadline and they can take their time and come in approving or rejecting the network? And secondly, just from a cash perspective, historically, I think you guys have always maintained $1.5 billion to $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Now the business is smaller, just wanted to understand what the minimum cash needs are just for the core business? Thanks.","Erik Carlson","Well, the minimum cash deals are dollar, right, so, we've maintained cash balances for something I mean, as we because we're always looking for opportunity out there and sometimes when you have cash you build and take advantage of an opportunity out there. Obviously, we believe the best opportunity for us is building a new state-of-the-art standalone 5G network, we think that's the best opportunity. That's what we'll use cash for, and obviously we have debt payments that we have coming up as well. So pretty clear probably where our cash balances are going to go, absent some change in the marketplace. Those are part of the questions.","Traditionally, companies just file their build out and that's accepted in short order and life goes on, we would expect that we would be treated the same as precedent has been in the past. But obviously, the FCC sometimes changes precedent. And that's always a possibility, no matter what you're doing, but again, I don't want to make it -- where the FCC wants to go is exactly where this company wants to go, right? Which is, this FCC to the credit, once this country to lead in 5G and I don't believe that it is possible to lead in 5G based on what I've seen around the world. I don't believe it's possible in 5G without somebody entering the marketplace with the new build 5G and all the 5G can do and the architecture this required to do that. Simple examples you know today you've heard about Milo antennas, most people's antennas aren't Milo antennas. ","Today you've heard about virtualized networks, right, nobody's got a virtualized network today, right? The SEC would like more broadband, particularly worldwide. That's a pretty interesting thing you could do when you're building a new network from scratch. That's economics so that gets to be pretty interesting, right? So Dish Network is on the fact that I'm going to digress to the question, but there's kind of three things that happened in this quarter, that are worthy of that one is AT&T is perfected licenses with the IoT network. So, the last two years, we've answered questions as to whether an IoT is acceptable network, I think that question is answered with by AT&T.","The second thing is that mid-band spectrum is now particularly around the world, 5G networks around the world are being built but mid-band spectrum, T-Mobile's building is going to do some 5G and 600-megahertz low band. And Verizon honestly looks to be at least initially a lone wolf in the world today at this the millimeter wave technology but where the puck is going, is people are starting to look more and more mid-band for 5G. That's not surprising to us, right? But we're we are well positioned in the mid-band spectrum and low-band spectrum to build a 5G network and that's becoming more evident that those people who really people who particularly people to maybe test they took the millimeter wave stuff on the short-term. That's not to say that millimeter wave is not going to get their long-term but millimeter waves going to have some challenges for a full 5G network for most consumers in the short-term.","The second and third thing is that people are, it's a very knowledgeable people now understand its architecture has to change. For a wireless network, the legacy of 30 years of wireless networks is unsustainable, and to do -- to unleash the power of 5G. So a company called Rocket 10 in Japan demonstrated, or not demonstrated, but talked about it Mobile World Congress, their architecture for fully virtualized network, they had small companies like Dell and like Intel and Cisco and other people supporting what they're doing on and some other names you probably haven't heard of, right? But that architecture is for people who now really understand it that's starting to gain credibility, right, and as we've been talking about architecture for a longtime making a difference. We're in a position to build a virtualized network from ground floor up it's not been a very, very different for legacy companies to get to in fact we'll take them a long period of time to do it.","And I think over the next quarters and maybe next year's that architecture people will start understanding the architecture is the technology change of 5G is important, but can be fully utilized in terms of change architecture which means you got it. It means, you got to go to every tower to everything down and build back up again. That's difficult to do when you got 100 million customers. In our case, we don't have any customers that we can build it, right in the first-half. Sorry for a long answer.","Kannan Venkateshwar","No problem. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now hear from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick","Hi guys, thanks. Two, if I can. First, Charlie to follow up on that, we've been hearing that the complexity of the Rakuten build is creating delays, how are you doing on building the architecture of your 5G network and how reliant, are you on their success. And then second, Eric, you mentioned talking to AT&T about HBO. Can you give us an idea of the impact of Game of Thrones in April. Should we expect churn to pick up again this quarter or do you think it's mostly through in the first quarter? Thanks.","Erik Carlson","So Phil, obviously we're not going to, we normally don't give guidance or not going to give guidance on kind of Q2 and what you see from a HBO perspective. But here's what I would tell you obviously, we talked a little bit about Q1 in my opening remarks there. There's really when we think about the HBO. There's really a few ways to, you know that our customers are able to access Game of Thrones and we've, been quarter in some of the trades and how we're helping folks to get that, but we kind of put it in three cohorts right, folks that are in linear TV today.","So, on the DISH TV platform that no can stream, they have the right broadband throughput to stream and they do stream right for could be Netflix via a variety of things those folks it's been, it's been fairly easy for us to help them understand where Game of Thrones is available and usually they have been able to sign up for a month or two to get the Season 8 Game of Thrones. You've got a second cohort, which are folks that have the ability to stream the right broadband throughput. But I haven't really streamed before. And so, we've been able to help a lot of those folks finding - find a device or a mechanism like Xbox or something maybe they have in their house, already an iPad and get them signed up to be able to consume the content -- the Game of Thrones content that they want for, the next month or two. And then you've got a group of customers and Charlie alluded to this a little bit earlier is which you know, they really can't stream and so they don't have a solution they rely on Satellite TV to get a premium service. And with removal of HBO from our service obviously, AT&T through DirecTV has been able to acquire those subscribers who are interested in it. And so, we're continuing to monitor the situation closely and try to provide the best experience we can in spite of our circumstances that we're in, in order to help get good folks Season 8 and kind of get through the next few weeks of Game of Thrones.","Charlie Ergen","Bill, it's Charlie. First of all, for continents, I'd say just where they started on - they started on architecture of August of last year. So they've been at it for whatever it is - and they -- for me it's unbelievable what they've been able to do an eight months in terms of design a new architecture. And bringing together the parties and the partners that they have, again some you've heard of and some you haven't. But they're all incredibly - they're incredibly talented companies. I mean like some of the best ever seen, take this on the smaller ones that are involved in right now.","So I don't have any inside information as if there are schedule or run into roadblocks. It's a complicated thing that they're doing. I would, my expectation was - that they will run into roadblocks as they go along, as will we, it's just whether you're tenacious enough to overcome and with the partners to roll in the same direction. And for all indications, they have a lot of that in the companies. We are somewhat dependent on them in the sense that, that we're very fortunate that their - that they are first because much of what they're doing - I don't know we would have had the skill set to assemble that powerful, that good team as they have, I don't know we had that skill set. I don't think we understood. I don't think August of last year we understood the power of the architecture but delay they did and so we're learning incredible amount and I think that, I don't think they have to, I don't think that would be a wild success but I think they do have to make breakthroughs in technology and software and I think that will happen and I think that will demand our benefit and it reminds me a lot of 1994 when we started [indiscernible] in 1992, we believe the digital compression was going to be there by 1995.","But we'd never built a digital compressed set-top box before and we'd never done. Some of the things that were necessary is very complex project. We're fortunate that that DirecTV and RCA did a lot of heavy lifting in terms of making a digital although not truly impact to they did do digital compression first and they did a lot of the heavy lifting and we were able to come in and take the lessons learned from them and some of the vendors that they used and make it true. The world's first really true impact to product that that we own, we had a better product. We did things like flat -- we are the first guys to do flash memory in the set-top box as an example, so we could download software without having to replace the equipment. So we were able to take and build upon what they were able to do and I think in this case, not just rocket science but a couple of the companies around the world as they go to virtualize network will be able to build on that because our networks not tomorrow. Our Phase 2 is still years out and we're now confident that enough people are focused on virtualization and network that we'll be able to build upon the team to help us.","Philip Cusick","Thanks. Charlie or Erik, if I can follow up, you see the data on your customers viewing on your set-top box was Game of Thrones a big part of your HBO viewing in the past?","Erik Carlson","Phil, I think that's probably just a level of detail that we're not going to share here but you are right. I mean we do have viewership on our customers, so we understand what content is watched, when, where and the trends.","Charlie Ergen","It's not just Game of Thrones for HBO, I mean HBO it is Game of Thrones, people would just drop HBO after it's over, so HBO is a powerful brand out there and it has a wide variety of following it. Having said that it's an interesting battle because customers, we're not just rated number one in in-home service. We've been number one in customer service for a while now and people like DISH and so their some of our customers saying, hey we'd love to have HBO but we're going to support you, we don't want higher fees. We don't want to pay money for it when it's available elsewhere or whether somebody else would give it away for free. We understand and we'd like you well enough, we're willing to stay with you. Some people are so, HBO is their life, is their whole lifeblood and they lead us. And I think in terms of the quarter to Erik and team with Univision down and HBO down, the results of churn are actually pretty incredible because if you take the churn of service is being down, it's pretty low. I don't know if it's a record low like you want to add.","Erik Carlson","It's definitely close to a record level, I mean we are definitely seeing very good, very good results. Based on the transition that we've been going through, and talking about for quite some time, which is really focusing on the right customer and the right geography and focusing on profitability and getting high value customers, so, obviously there's less impact but you're right, I mean Charlie in my opening I mentioned that a little bit less than half of our net sub loss could be attributed to channel removals in Q1.","Charlie Ergen","So my point is some of those customers going to our competition, so their numbers are artificially propped up, ours are artificially negative given that Univision is now back on the service, right. We're still going to have a headwind from HBO obviously but on the Univision side, there could be a slight headwind in Univision because now we raised our price, so some plus customers who don't watch Univision say, I'm going to leave you because I don't love to pay too much money because I didn't, I would add Univision off but I think the vast majority of our customers appreciate Univision with the right motivations between Univision and DISH, that's actually a place we can start to maybe start to grow the business with the help of Univision, we actually grow that business thing. So it's actually from my perspective, Erik and team did a pretty good job of going through the last few quarters with some pretty, I think customers like this and they will hang in there. They like the fact that we are the company that fights, we are one company that the TV business is not sustainable as some has got to change and we got lot of ideas on how to change and change it.","Philip Cusick","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike McCormack with Guggenheim Partners.","Mike McCormack","Hi guys, thanks. Charlie maybe just a quick comment on what you're seeing out there, you got a lot of these OTT offerings with price hikes either in the rearview mirror or pending, at the same time you guys are out there with Sling with a pretty aggressive promotion, so maybe just some thoughts around what you're seeing in there from a pricing standpoint and your strategy around Sling. And then just thinking about the maturities as we look out over the next couple of years, again put aside Phase 2 but on the 2021 maturity listing, it's not problematic but from a cash flow perspective probably not supportive. So what are the financing options as you approach 2021? Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","Well I don't -- I will take the first part and Warren will take -- I will take the second part and Warren will take the first part on Sling. I don't necessarily agree with premise but obviously we are cognizant of the fact that we have obligations to buy. And we obviously we understand what our maturities are. So it is something that we focus on and something that we develop plans internally to make sure we can address it. So I don't know what else to say on that, Warren you could add to that question there.","Warren Schlichting","Sure. So we expect to have, our strategy of Sling, Erik mentioned it earlier in terms of providing value and improving our user experience and always focused on stability but and profitability. So Sling's promotions have done well for us but we are focused on providing on attracting profitable customers. And it's a marathon not a sprint. So I think we like where we are, we like our position in the market with our competitors taking their prices out that's only improved ROI we think, and you'll see more of the same, I think in the second quarter from us.","Mike McCormack","Are you guys seeing rotation from your Linear product into the Sling product?","Warren Schlichting","I think we keep track of cord cutting on the Linear product and I think it's inevitable, we'll see some of that but we don't specify between Sling and other OTT providers.","Mike McCormack","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","We will now hear from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk","Thanks. Hey, Charlie. Six or seven years ago when you first started buying Spectrum, I think you framed \u2013- you talked about the challenges that Pay-TV was going to face and kind of frame Spectrum as a hedge and maybe something from a broadband standpoint but obviously 5G is kind of a new opportunity, IoT is a new opportunity. When you think about the Pay-TV business, is it necessary to hold on to that just because it generates free cash flow to fund some of this build out or given that 5G build out could be larger and requiring a partner. Are you willing to part with the Pay-TV business. And obviously if it's free cash flow as you got an attractive offer?","Charlie Ergen","Yes, let me start with actually we started buying Spectrum, I think 18 years ago, actually we about the first Spectrum auction I think which was the DVR spectrum or we entered that, we didn't buy, we entered the auction. So we've been in virtually every auction as actually said, bolt-on we don't get a lot because we don't have the money to do it. But we certainly saw six or seven years ago the kind of things that people are writing about now which is the Linear TV business as of the heavy advertising load and the disparity between the power of the content owner and the distributor that that was so that things we're going to have, where the price was going to go up more than the marketplace could allow.","So that that all happened. And instead of put money into a guy and we got penalized in Wall Street because our number we suddenly didn't grow as a company because we were taken, the capital we had and deploying that in a much longer term vision of Spectrum and Wireless. And the problem we had is that we wanted to do built we were in a position to build on LTE advanced network. But the H-block rules got changed on us. And so, we needed the H-block rules to stay the same for us to build that network, when it got changed, that still was down the spiral of going all down like in a bunch of other things that ultimately happened, which means we missed that paradigm shift window. That turns out maybe to be serendipitous, because how the 5G technologies is materially bigger breakthrough than the 4G, than the LTE advanced breakthrough.","And the architecture requires different, so had we built -- we're building it, we're building a traditional network today in IoT. We are able to build and we got a receiver in a base-band processing in all of the tower and all the archaic ways. That's what we're forced to do because the technology didn't exist till next year to do it the right way. And so, we're forced to build the network I -- when I go to one of our towers, I want to throw up. Because I'm -- we're building something that we know is technically is going to work, it's technically absolutely compared to taking -- I guess the way I would describe it is, when you go home tonight well, go look at a tower, and go get a cell tower. And when you look at the -- well, you'll see some antennas on top, but will be mindful antenna, so they can be replaced. And then you see radio and then you go down the bottom, you're probably going to see a shed about the size of a C-container. It's all got, it's got bass band process, and in it it's got power and it's got all kinds of wires, cables and get there.","We're taking that shed. We're going to take that shed, and we're going to put it in the cloud. And, and I'm oversimplifying a bit more complicated than that. But we're taking that big shed that everybody uses today for the most part, and we're going to put in the cloud. When we do that, right and when you virtualize it that means you can do something called network slicing, which means that we're not -- our business plan is not just about phones in fact phones maybe very small piece of what we're doing, we're able then to get into the power of 5G, which gets into robotics and smart cities and artificial intelligence and our fit and all the things that healthcare and climate change and agriculture, all the things that you can do, and with an API to industrial companies and verticals, right? Thomas vehicles, right? You can't do that with an existing network today. So that's why we're excited about what we're doing and look I'm not going to convince you but, in this call, I'm going to quit talking. Right, but this watch is over the next couple years and things\u2026","Walter Piecyk","But none of that has to do with the Pay-TV business. So if you can find the partner to fund it?","Charlie Ergen","And answer to your question, the Pay-TV business is still the biggest use of the network is probably going to be video. And so, there are a lot of reasons why video makes a lot of sense. You saw T-Mobile go out and spend a fair amount of money on a decent video company because they believe video is important. So we think video makes sense, right? Having said that, is it as important as maybe we thought two or three years ago, I'd say maybe not quite as important as we thought.","Walter Piecyk","So on a flip side, like why do you push it? Why do you push yourself? Rather than waiting for someone? Why don't you -- why don't you put that thing on the blocks and try and get what you can get because you're losing 10% of your subscriber base every year and you haven't been positive on it for six years.","Charlie Ergen","Well, here's a Tennessee recommendation. We take a look at everything because we find an Analyst like you are usually have some good ideas, right? So that's one thing but from a management perspective, at least the way I like to manage is we want to build value every day. And so, I don't believe -- I don't believe that Eric and team-built value and DISH last quarter. I don't believe that Warren and team-built value and Sling last quarter, but they are very close to being able to build value, right? And the challenge to them if they have enough tenacity and focus, I do believe we had a chance to build value in those. I know we build value marvelous. I know we built by in the last quarter, and if we can build value and video and we should proceed that we can build value, then we got to figure out a way to do it. But if we have to look, anytime in business, you can change your -- good management is changing things. We don't have to do the same thing we did yesterday, we can do something different here. Erik, you might as off the subject, but you might want to talk about in-Home Services, right? There's a place we can build value. So maybe we take a talk about what we're doing in Home Services.","Erik Carlson","And then just for a second, Walt, it's one of the things that the capability that we built over the years by having a service DISH TV customers and obviously today we use it a variety of different ways and are creating value through our Smart Home Services Group, whether it's taking care of DISH customers or Sling customers or you know, other brands that we may not sell or be affiliated with from an owner perspective, right. So helping Amazon or we've talked about KB Homes, we've talked about the things that we're doing with other big brands to help where the in-Home Services Group and I mentioned earlier, I mean, tough job and as more things get connected. I mean, there's just more complexity into the homeowner's environment and they need help and we're definitely a resource that can help and that's an opportunity and a capability that grows kind of from, old legacy, Pay-TV, so to speak. So, we're excited about a variety of things here.","Richard Greenfield","It's Richard Greenfield, just following up assuming you don't blow out of the Pay-TV businesses we all just suggested. But Bob Iger at Disney recently was on CNBC, and said, \"Consumers don't really want 150 or 200 channels for a significant price, just wondering as you think about kind of the future of the Pay-TV business.\" Do you have to start tearing certain channels, the RSN deal? Whether or not Sinclair buys it or not, I think your deal with those RSN ends up this summer. Philosophically, do RSN need to be tiered? I mean, do you have to start putting channels on tiers and make smaller packages, like you did with Sling, but do you need to start doing that across all of your business?","Charlie Ergen","Rich, it's Charlie, I think the linear flick, I think the linear business has to change, man the Linear TV providers will say, \"Hey, we got long-term contracts,\" let's just wide it out and make some money. And then some of them tried to play with the direct-to-consumer while they're making that change, right. So with all due respect to Disney, not everybody wants to pay for ESPN either. So, but they don't really give you a lot of choice about where you are accurate. So everybody's looking at their own self-interest, I believe it take a little bit different approach where with it and there's probably some things you can do on your TV business, that long-term will be better for Linear TV providers, but might not help them as much in the short-term as I'd like.","But long-term it will be better for them to extend the runway and having more competitive because in Linear TV, there's better content than there is a way better content across the board than you would see on a Netflix or Amazon or whatever or Hulu that people are paying for. There's way better content in general. But it's hard to get to. And there's a lot of commercials, right? So how would you make that look a little better? And how would you make that more -- where would you -- how would you make a better product thinking about consumers first and saying if I'm a consumer, here's what I want, because otherwise, you're just it'd be like, it'll continue the kind of the way it is, except in rural America, right and rural America skews a little older, skews a little bit more, read more newspapers, they just give us a little bit more for what we're doing. And we started to focus on rural America about three years ago. And I think that's going to pay dividends for us, so there's a longer-term life of what we're doing.","Richard Greenfield","Thank you very much.","Operator","Now, moving to a question from Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason Bazinet","I just had two basic questions. One of them maybe a little bit naive. If we get to this point where the 5G network is up and running, do you imagine it being a business-to-business relationship or wholesale or do you imagine serving consumers as well? And then second, I think you filed last year some comments against the sprint T-Mobile deal. Understanding everything that you filed in as public comments, are there any advantages if the government approves Sprint T-Mobile from business perspective? Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","The first part of question is that there's no question within the 5G network as we envisioned that today, that we will have a big part of business-to-business. In other words, every Fortune 500 company, in my opinion, and we spent the last three years talking to CEOs about what they want to see in a wireless network. That almost every Fortune 500 company would like to probably want -- that some part of their business would be an API that they could actually have a slice of our network, and it looks like their own network. So that's certainly a big part of it. We certainly are looking at what we would call a neutral wholesale side of the network. So that creativity that people have to be having reached on a network. So think of it as wireless AWS, in a funny sort of way. And the consumer and the network obviously, will work for consumers. But I wouldn't say that the incumbents do a pretty good job with consumers today. They're going to improve their networks in their version of 5G, not -- maybe not 5GE but the next version of 5G, they're going to improve their network for consumers. And that may be because when it commence that maybe a little tougher for us with perhaps some pretty big disruption factors, which may happen, but are not so we'll have to see.","As we architected and as we rollout the architecture of what it's become more evident of what our network will be and where the process will be and when we'll get our return on investment for that. But if we have our scheme [ph] announcement T-Mobile yes, we publicly have been against it. The harm that even their own economists have shown their prices will go up and they got it. So as presented right that we're against that merger because it of the harm that's going to create and unless they solve the four to three kind of issue that they have with concentration and inevitable price increases.","Jason Bazinet","And the advantages if it goes through?","Erik Carlson","Advantages for T-mobile and to Sprint and to their executives who get 100 million pay off.","Jason Bazinet","Understood, thank you.","Operator","And now I'll move to our next question. And that will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett","Hi, two if I could one, just on the satellite business for a minute. You brought this up a minute ago, Charlie, when you talked about rural. How much of your subscriber base is sufficiently rural that you think it is kind of really well insulated from the competition. Even from OTT competition to the extent that there are limitations with their broadband connections, but where it's kind of insulated from cable competition at least. And then on the, wireless business could you just take us into a little bit of the process with the FCC.","I think to some of us from the outside. It looks a little bit like a black box where you're kind of waiting to find out what the FCC says about what you're building. I suspect, that's probably not correct. And you've got an ongoing dialog with the FCC about what does and what doesn't satisfy the build out requirements. I am wondering if you could just comment on that a little bit and take us through how that process works?","Charlie Ergen","I mean, I think on the FCC you should do this homework, Craig if you not ready, but just read the terms of the license then look at the precedent that the FCC has. An FCC generally goes by precedent and we have what's called flexible use license. That license is eerily similar to what AT&T just did when they perfected - with their flexible use license they perfected spectrum with an IoT network. I think some of the confusion came we first talked about IoT which is probably 2.5 years ago or something.","That was a new term for a lot of people even people to FCC that was kind of a new thing and there was lot of skepticism on lot of people's part. That an IoT network wasn't a real network or wasn't something that was - that there wasn't really a business there. But in fact all the major players now have launched their own IoT networks. In fact that's kind of a detrimental to us right. We had hoped that they thought maybe that with all the skepticism around IoT we'd be the only guys doing IoT and we're pretty damn excited about that.","Now obviously we have not only competition in IoT but they have a head start on us. So it's going to be more difficult for us to be successful at least in Phase 1 then maybe we had anticipated a couple years ago. But I don't think that again, I think that when the FCC wrote a letter to us asking about our network and put that out publicly. It was an unusual move on their part and obviously created some skepticism on what we're doing that I think was probably necessary. All I can do is have confidence - my experience with the FCC over 30 years has been as hard working people that are focused on what's good for this country. And if that's the case then that has, I don't believe that's changed and this FCC works really hard. This FCC is working really hard on wireless. Then they're going to like they're going to like what we do. But they like what we do.","Craig Moffett","Just call for a dialog.","Charlie Ergen","I am pretty confident I don't see the risk maybe that other people see that because what we're doing is going to be really good for the country. And what we're doing is really impossible to strong a word, but very difficult in the short-term rather in complex to do. And we're focused maybe on some different parts of the network, than they are, that and we want to beat China or beat the other parts in 5G. I don't believe this country can do it without people like companies like DISH. Again that's been a lot of time travel around world looking at other people's wireless network. I'm excited about our opportunity to do this the good old fashion American way. We have great strength in software so why not build a network for software so we don't have hardware providers in the United States to come. And incumbent File 14 0.33 out there today it's got U.S. hardware radios that I know of. They are all born some from China and some form Europe.","Wow, what if could use get to American ingenuity and have a network that's more secure there's lot more software, more efficient, that would be good things and I think that's where the FCC wants to go. And so I think I am not expecting them cheer leader tomorrow but I'm expecting them they'll be very curious in what we're doing and we'll learn more about what we're doing and I think they'll be supported.","Craig Moffett","But you have an ongoing dialog about it, I mean is it something where they give you feedback when you talk to them regularly about here's what we're planning to do and that either does or doesn't satisfy the build-out requirements So that some this uncertainty gets kicked out of the bar [ph]?","Charlie Ergen","One thing about DISH is you have conversation with us and it goes in the fall and so as much as you might want that information we won't comment on that.","Erik Carlson","Yeah, I'm not empty for that it's much, much better to have private conversations and know that those conversations will stay that is a better way to do business and so you don't, as you know, you don't get a lot of leaks coming out of DISH.","Craig Moffett","Yeah, I'm just trying to understand, not on the substance. But on the process of just are those conversations frequent and ongoing core or is this really a sort of you do one thing and then wait for them to respond. I just. I'm just trying to understand the process?","Erik Carlson","Well, let me talk about the public process we annually filed reports on our progress, and those are public, right? And the FCC is particular case this time they did -- I will grant you, was unusual. They did ask us for follow-up questions, right, which we addressed publicly. So that's the process that the world knows about right. And so but any other process that was private. And by the way, it extends to next part take where there is something that - there is something that's that would be - there is expert rules. So to the extent that, that something that there is something that has to be disclosed, we do that as does the FCC from need to. So all that stuff, we just follow the rules but if there is private conversations between us and any company or any agency and that legally is not required to be disclosed. That's not something you're going to hear from us.","Craig Moffett","Fair enough, and on the rural\u2026","Erik Carlson"," Craig I will tell you, why would a company - the big picture stuff is we're investing -- we've invested $25 billion in spectrum because we think there is a bit - nobody gave us anything for free, we went to actions we paid for. Invested 25 years -- $25 billion I personally invested 38 years in communications but of which the last seven has been almost nonstop and wireless. And why would you do that, if you didn't think you could make a difference. And I was excited the first day we opened up our business in 1980, with a Big Dish. I was excited to sit in China and watching the satellite launch, and I'm excited about what I see in wireless from a 5G architecture perspective.","And it's fun to get up every day and build a team and work with the hardworking people here at DISH to see if we can do that. No guarantees, might fail. And some people out there are rooting against us. And some people see the glasses half full. And we think I see it -- where the decks in our favor, and we are out and we control. With the exception of regulatory we control our own destiny. And if we control our own destiny I think regulatory will be supportive, if can control our own destiny, let's see what we can do. That's what, that's what a good management is, that's was good about business. That's what makes it bond, and that makes you get out of bed every day because we have a purpose. And our - we have a purpose and our employees have a purpose, that makes it a fun company. I don't if I had answered your question. I will give you follow up.","Craig Moffett","Well I could ask a lot of follow ups I sort of beat dead horse because I'm still trying to get at, how much it's an ongoing dialog. But I'll let it go. I guess there is a rural question that I asked before. How much is rural, but then I would also love to know just as your perspective changed at all as you think about. It sounds like you're very excited about building a network, has your perspective about the calculus of ever selling this Spectrum versus building changed and has anything changed it over the last year or so, that makes you more inclined for one or the other?","Charlie Ergen","So first on rural, I'll make \u2013- I will say majority of our people are from rural, I grew up in rural America, we're a rural company at heart. We think we can make a difference in rural. We're excited about things we can do in 5G broadband. In rural America, we have already done satellite broadband in rural America. So that's a big focus of where we are, we think we're somewhat insulated to some of the things that are going on in Linear TV but not totally insulated. So it's still a declining business, right. So I don't want to sugarcoat it but we think we can build value there. I hope that Erik and team can build either. In terms you never heard me say we're going to sell Spectrum. I know a lot of analysts assume that's what we're doing. I certainly think people thought that that it seem kind of crazy that the company would go out and take on AT&T and Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile and then do something that seems kind of a crazy thing to do, it's kind of like when we launched satellite, seem like a crazy thing to take on Comcast and AT&T and General Motors. But we want to be disruptive. We think we can, we can do it. If we fail, if we're failing or the regulatory environment as such and we just can't do it, then fairness to our shareholders and people or boys really. Yes, we'd be forced into liquidation situation.","I would, I don't know that we'd lose money but I'd see it as a personal failure. I really believe this company can make a difference. I'm going to [indiscernible], climate change, we can make a difference in climate change, right and we can still have cows because when you go to agriculture with sensors in the 5G network built the right way, you're going to know how much the water or fertilizer.","And more importantly, you are going to have that year after year after year on what you're supposed to do during the drought or so forth and so on. So we can have sensors in weather monitoring and air monitoring, right. So that we can have that real knowledge about climate change instead of a debate between this side or that side, right.","So we can affect climate change, we can still expect healthcare particularly in rural America, right because now you can you're wearing a device, it tells you before you're going to have a heart attack, before you have a heart attack means you can do robotic surgery in rural America, so that people in rural America aren't penalized, when it comes to hospital care or medical care. We can affect education, right because that means we can eliminate or reduce the digital divide, that gets pretty exciting to the company, right. And we've got 15,000 boys in Brookside about and our job as management is to lead them despite the skeptics.","Craig Moffett","Thank you very much for that, Charlie. I appreciate it.","Charlie Ergen","Thanks.","Jason Kiser","So Operator, we are running little long. We need to get that pressed. I think we got one more analyst call it will take and then we'll head to the press.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our final question from the analyst community. [Operator Instructions] We will begin the media portion of this call following the answer to the final analyst question. And our final analyst question will come from Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research.","Marci Ryvicker","Thank you. I have two, we all have our own opinions on how Sling and Pay-TV are performing relative to our expectations. But Charlie, I'm curious how you would characterize Sling and Pay-TV relative to your expectations and very curious about Sling especially after this quarter and then a quick follow-up just from an accounting standpoint, this core CapEx line is that where wireless CapEx is being recorded?","Charlie Ergen","I will take that. Yes, if you're referring to the 10-Q, there's a general corporate CapEx and that's where wireless would be.","Erik Carlson","And answer to your first part of the question, Marci, I think I can't answer that question but I would say yes. I don't believe we build value in Sling. In fact, I don't think we gave guidance in Sling in the last year. And I think that's disappointing to me because every day I walk in, I try to manage by building value in what we're doing, maybe a long-term value because one of our principles was think long-term, right. And I think, but having said that Sling is perilously close to building that day. They just have to from a management perspective; they have to go do a few things. They know what those things are. They execute on those things. They're going to build real value, right. If they don't execute like anything else, we don't execute on those things, you don't build value. So yes, I think, I don't think we've built over the last quarters that value every day in Sling. And but I think we can, and I don't know if you want to comment on that, Warren?","Warren Schlichting","But you get that -- I'm going to say still publicly, but it gets a speech every day.","Erik Carlson","I never heard that before.","Warren Schlichting","Yes, look we've made progress on a lot of our internal KPIs. So I guess I would say I -- glass half full, we continue to march forward. We still believe we're the only profitable, gross margin basis OTT provider out there. And so, I see wins to Charlie's point. We need a lot of opportunity for improvement as well. Our user experience and the value we provide both have places where we can improve.","Marci Ryvicker","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take questions from the members of the media. [Operator Instructions] Our first media question will come from Scott Moritz with Bloomberg.","Scott Moritz","Great, thanks. Hey, Charlie. Speaking of obsolete 4G networks, the spec -- deal might face some challenges in that go through. Are you too far down the road on your new network to have an interest in Sprint at this point, is that window closed?","Charlie Ergen","Well, I don't think I can answer that question. But obviously, that I don't think it's public that six years ago we tried to buy Sprint. I think if you look at the Sprint T-Mobile merger that's for that they filed you'll see that several companies we're in discussions with Sprint. In addition to T-Mobile about their interest in Sprint, so I think Sprint, I don't think Sprint's going away whether they have $100 billion parent, right? So if the merger then goes, I think Sprint's going to have a lot of -- they could build their own network, they can improve their own network and they can, they don't have a lot of options. Let's put it that way. But I don't think, I think not having infrastructure today is an advantage because every, every wireless operator let's say they have 50,000 towers there, they are going to touch every one of those towers to get to a 5G network. They're also going to, it's hard because if you're if you're going to get too technical, but you're but you're but when you have this big BTS thing that you bought -- your flexibility is the lowest common denominator.","And so, your kind of stuck with incumbent things until you can break it apart. And what you do in a virtualized network, you break apart the physical layer's user plane, you break all that apart, and then you got to reassemble it. It's can't do that with vendors, you put it all in one place. I mean, you can I mean those vendors have to agree to do it, right? And they're on the path do that over time. But we get to start from square one and with it all broken apart to begin with, and so all we have to do is assemble it. So it's -- what I know about wireless today, it's taken me seven years. 365 days a year, seven years. So it is not all those bits and pieces aren't that well known. I don't know if I answered your question.","Scott Moritz","Thanks.","Operator","We'll now move for our next question, and that will come from Drew FitzGerald with The Wall Street Journal.","Drew FitzGerald","Yes. Hi, Charlie. Two questions if I could. First are you at the stage now where for the phase two build out of the wireless network where you can have discussions with potential partners, strategic interested parties? And if so, what -- what are they looking for? Or what do they seem interested in, out of the network? And then second, on the Sling TV front, where do you see, are the recent price increases overall in the market for virtual and DPDs as those runner course or do you see that continuing?","Charlie Ergen","So, Warren will take that\u2026","Warren Schlichting","So look, it's the Pay-TV businesses have price increases for longtime and I'm sure they'll continue to have price increases. I think Sling is proud of our ability to -- we introduced this skinny bundle and we've been proud of our ability to keep it skinny and keep a very unique structure of ad on tiers. So, never say never, but we have kept our price even in the face of those pricing hikes and we have benefited from that. And so, I think we'll continue to play that month and time as we grow. I mean\u2026","Charlie Ergen","So, the big picture is, yes, we've [indiscernible] to answer that, but I think the [indiscernible] the conversations that we typically have been having had been, what would you want to see in their network. So, looking for customer to make sure we design that network with potential users in mind. In terms of -- I'll make it up if they, not make it up, but there are certain things that people want to know. They want security, they want access to data, they want on demand pricing. It might be different in the middle of the night than it would be during the day. They want a nationwide, they want a private network for their factory, but they want to tie into a nationwide network. So, there are themes that people have that we have a pretty good feel for where we're taking the network.","And then, most of our conversations now are from -- I use the word, \"Partner,\" in a different way maybe than the analysts do but they can help us build that network with what skill sets that they have and they will and take some chances on us. In other words, who's going to write that software? Who's going to help us with edge computing? So, you're starting to hear both the access edge computing but what the heck does that mean and how -- what do we need to do there? There are people who already do some of that today and so, it seems that people who are already doing some of that or have plans to do that that would be better to partner with them than build that ourselves.","And then there maybe revenue opportunities that of DISH wireless for them that they have to look at. And so, we have conversations with those people to see whether they have an interest and what are their business plans. But most companies that are involved in communications are involved in communications, are developed in their own 5G strategies. And I'm not going to put words in their mouth, right, and I am not inside of their board meetings and their strategy meetings but when you develop a 5G strategy, you can't help but come to the conclusion that a standalone 5G network with mid band and low band spectrum is a pretty good place to start.","Drew FitzGerald","Got you. and are any of those potential partners -- would these be -- these would all be companies that would be looking to initially either supply expertise or be customers or would these also be potentially partners that could co-invest in the network?","Erik Carlson","I think we have equal discussions between people whose primary motivation is to supply us some products and services. In other words, they are looking for sales, right? And an equal number of conversations where people stand strategically listening to what you're doing that'd be important to us and to our business. And therefore, we're interested in what you are doing because it will help our business and not looking to be in this supply, right.","Drew FitzGerald","Right, thanks.","Erik Carlson","And some people are waiting for us to put it out, to pick the pieces up and everything in between.","Operator","All right. With that, that does conclude today's question and answer session. I'll turn the call back over to your host for any additional or closing remarks.","Erik Carlson","We don't really have any closing remarks.

Your line is open.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Maybe just a comment, if you will, on what you are seeing out there with respect to the Sling multi-stream. How much of an impact are you seeing as far as demand goes? And then I guess thoughts as we go into the fourth quarter with AT&T\/DIRECTV launching DIRECTV Now. Do you anticipate that to be a significant competitive threat? Any answers there would be great. Thanks.","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","Okay. This is Roger Lynch. The multi-stream service we launched in Q2 is in beta and then we took it out of beta at the end of the quarter in June. We saw pretty strong growth for it, and we're pleased with the launch, which is why we ended up taking it out of beta. It is a service that we also see some level of overlap with our single stream service where customers will take both services because the content offer is different and obviously towards the end of the quarter we had a lot more content in the multi-stream service with Viacom and NBC.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","All right.","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","So that was the reason we took it out, we saw demand for it, we expanded the content offer quite significantly, and we have pleased with the uptake of it so far. There is some migration that we see from one service to the other. So after the multi-stream came out, people for whom the multi-stream aspect of it or the content offer that was in that was more appealing to them than the single stream. We saw some migration from single stream service over the multi-stream service. And we expect that probably to continue. On DIRECTV Now, this is a \u2013 we obviously have always expected that we're going to see more competition. I've been a little surprised that it's taken this long for anyone to really launch. My expectation is that as new entrants enter this market, we're just going to see faster growth over the top. Obviously, it'll affect the market share that we have right now, but I don't expect that it's going to materially affect the growth of our business.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","If I can just add one more just on your thoughts on cannibalization. Anything you're seeing from your traditional satellite customers moving over to the new products?","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","We've never seen much at all migration from DISH Network over to Sling TV. Historically, it's been a different customer base that we attract for Sling versus the satellite business.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. Maybe you guys could just give us some more color on the broader video market. The losses were a little bit more than we expected in the quarter. So maybe first on the DBS side, did you see any impact from the \u2013 some of the programming dispute with Tribune or anything on the competitive side that was different this quarter? And then as relates to Sling, I know guys don't break them out. But maybe just qualitatively, was there any seasonality or something that in the quarter that potentially slowed the growth? I don't know, maybe like a hangover effect from March Madness, any color you could give there would be great. Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","This is Charlie. I'll take a stab at that and maybe Roger or Erik if you want to add a comment. Overall, on the \u2013 let's just take overall video marketplace. I mean, I think where we've gone strategically \u2013 we've been talking about it for a couple years \u2013 is that we think that the industry, the pay-TV industry, linear industry as we know it, we think it's a mature, declining business. It's clearly been a declining business for DISH for a while.","And we've really looked at that and said, we really over the last really six months, for sure, would look at every customer as kind of a P&L customer and say, do we think we could make profit to add a new customer during the lifecycle of that customer? Or if we have a current customer, do we think that they call in for upgrades or credits, and do we think that continued investment in that customer is going to be profitable?","So we know there's a high correlation example for credit scores. We know there's a high correlation for a profitable customer. There's a high correlation geographically where they live. We know there's a high correlation in terms of what equipment that they get from us. And so we take a lot of those factors, and I think we've just gone to a strategy that says it doesn't make sense for us to invest in a customer if we don't think we're going to get a return. That was never an issue 10 years ago, but that's an issue, as competition has come online, that wasn't there against DBS. OTT is certainly competition, but the cable industry is much stronger now because broadband now is a necessity for consumers, even in a way beyond where video is. So that's kind of it \u2013 it's the new normal, new reality where the marketplace is. It's been moving that direction. I think it's going to continue to move that direction.","Counter to that, the Sling OTT is kind of where the needle is going to move. It's \u2013 for us at DISH, it makes sense because we enter new markets that we can't get to today. Apartments, where you can't physically put a dish in the apartment or on the balcony, or you don't point south or in inner cities where you can't put a dish in downtown Manhattan, it opens up new places for us to go that we haven't been able to go in the past. So that's kind of how we look at it. Obviously, you'd prefer to have a robust subscriber growth, but we're not going to do that. We'd rather also make money, and it doesn't make sense to invest.","When you invest $1,000 \u2013 we realize the fact for our customer in the linear business is probably over $1,000, because we also count the programming discounts that you give people. And if that customer's going to have \u2013 you've got to look at the choices that that customer has today, and then you have to look at what choice is that customer going to have two years or three years from now before you get your payback. And as \u2013 one of the earlier questioners asked about, DIRECTV is going to launch \u2013 or AT&T is going to launch their own OTT service. Others will launch OTT services. So customers are going to have \u2013 they're not going to have two or three choices. They're going to have 10 or 15 choices for their video products. So we think it's just going to be a more competitive environment.","There is a seasonality, I think, we knew going in. And we're not shocked by it. But there is a seasonality to an OTT product that's not there in linear because it's one of the great advantages of an OTT product. It's very easy to sign on or sign off a month at a time. So as people go on vacation, as they become a \u2013 there's not a \u2013 until the Olympics start, there's probably not \u2013 and football season starts up, there's probably not compelling content on in the summer. So you do have a seasonality to it that's maybe more exaggerated than we would see in linear TV where it's kind of a hassle to turn on and off. It's more of a hassle to turn on and off. Although we have some of that for sure.","Roger, I don't know...","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","What we're seeing is a \u2013 certainly a secular growth in OTT marketplace for us. But overlaid against that is the seasonality that, as Charlie mentioned, can affect both top line and bottom line in terms of people turning service on and off. So it's similar to what we saw last summer against the backdrop of secular growth, though.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think I \u2013 and I forgot to answer part of your question, John. In terms of second quarter, I think that there are some contributing factors, maybe, that are a bit more abnormal from a growth perspective, or churn perspective I think in our case, which is, we did have a price increase. Because the market's more competitive and the consumer is starting to have more choices that those price increases, whereas before maybe people didn't look at it as much, they certainly look at price increases today in a way that they didn't before.","AT&T's acquisition of DIRECTV, they certainly have been very aggressive with AT&T customers who don't have DIRECTV. And they have a different mailing list, a different credit profile, of those customers that we wouldn't have access to, because they've got 100 million wireless customers. Not all those people have DIRECTV. So some of that that goes on. And then we do have although not as big an impact as you might think this quarter, but certainly Tribune and even NFL Network are two channels that are down currently on DISH in dispute. So those things all contribute to some abnormality that aren't normally there present the rest of the year.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi, Charlie, and maybe a question for Roger. Roger, I wonder if you could reflect on the operational characteristics of Sling for a second. We always see reports of issues associated with jitter and pixilation and freezing that come along with a live service. And I'm guessing that your internal data turns up all different kinds of explanations for where those problems occur in the network, whether it's congestion for backhaul into a particular neighborhood or what have you. Can you just talk about what you've learned about the technological challenges of a service like Sling? And how ready the infrastructure is to really support a very large-scale growth of a service like that?","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","Sure. Sure, Craig. First thing I'd say is, what we're seeing overall is significant improvements in performance. And that is across the ecosystem that we have to work in. So part of it is our internal systems, but also our network partners and content delivery network partners.","I think I've said on previous calls, if you were going to architect a network to deliver video, you wouldn't architect the Internet the way it was architected. It wasn't architected for synchronous video delivery. And so a lot of effort goes into designing systems to counteract the way the Internet was designed with its random discard of packets and things like that that happen in routers.","And so what we've found is the content delivery networks that we work with, they largely had architected their services around delivering files. And as our business has grown, and we put more pressure on them to always improve performance, they're figuring out ways to work with us to improve performance for a live video streaming service like this. So we certainly see quarter-over-quarter improvements in the performance of our service. But I think we're going to be chasing that for years trying to always improve it because it's a new service and it's new technologies that we're having to deploy to stream at high quantities of data and high peak in current usage.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Are the biggest bottlenecks for your response in the content delivery networks? Or are they elsewhere?","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","No, I think it's how we architect systems to work with content delivery networks to deliver video in a seamless way. So I wouldn't say it's all in there \u2013 in the way they're architected or all in the way. It's all just about optimization so that we can knock out increasingly corner cases. Like I think when we first launched, we had issues that I would call more systemic. I'm sure you wrote about them and others that when big events came up.","We don't tend to have those issues anymore. We don't have the systemic ones. They're more corner cases that we have to knock out where we find, in certain situations, a customer is having some problem, and what's the root cause of that and how can we architect our systems or have our CDN partners optimize their systems to knock out more corner cases. So much of what we do now is more whack-a-mole on what I call more corner cases rather than big systemic issues.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks, Roger.","Jason Kiser - Treasurer","Emily, do we have any more questions in queue?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Two, if I could. First of all, on fact. Could you just talk about how scalable that is to, I presume, we're looking at declining DBS gross adds in particular? And if there is any really meaningful portion of that cost associated with Sling? And secondly, broadband subs tailed down a little bit this quarter. Can you talk about that business in general and what the opportunities you see there to be? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, James, I didn't understand the first part of the question. What was \u2013 something about something being scalable?","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So how do we think about SAC and expense in terms of what's really linearly or close linearly fixed to DBS gross adds versus what's really sort of a fixed cost of the business as a whole? And so now how do we think about how SAC extending trends over time, assuming that DBS gross adds may be an ongoing decline?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, okay. I got it. Yeah, the one \u2013 this is Charlie. The one big cost that we have to watch pretty closely when it comes to the linear side of the business is the advertising budget, right? And to the extent that you're spending the same amount of advertising and getting less gross adds, obviously, your SAC could go up, right? So that's the piece that we'd kind of focus on.","The rest of it is probably not material at this point, but that particular one is. And again, we count the programming discounts in there as well, so that's a place that we think that \u2013 the industry has gotten a little bit more mature, a little bit better on that. I can remember last year we are all sitting around talking about $19.99, and even our team was, \"we got to be $19.99, because the industry is $19.99.\" And there's not a profitable customer coming in at $19.99 for anybody, so \u2013 in the linear business. So the world has changed to be \u2013 there's more discipline in the marketplace today, and you're normally starting customers in the industry today certainly well over $50 or $60. So your SAC actually can go down. If you look at it the way we do with programming discounts and all that in it, then your SAC actually can go down even though you may not be as efficient on your advertising side.","On the broadband side, that is a \u2013 satellite broadband, that's a business that's not mature yet. That's a business where there's will demand out there, but the satellites that we use in the high-demand markets, the beams for the most part are full. So all we're doing is treading water until EchoStar launches a new high-throughput satellite in December, and I think the first quarter of ViaSat launches their new high-throughput satellites.","So we should have a lot of new capacity coming online the first and second quarters of next year from EchoStar and ViaSat. And we think that reinvigorates that business in two ways. One is it opens up additional capacity for new customers, but it also allows us to give a better product to customers and give them more \u2013 give an existing customer more capacity for the same amount of money. And that should lead to the reduction in churn. So we're still optimistic about that side of the business, even though we know that there's not really much we can do between now and the launch of new satellites to grow that business.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi, S&P Global Market. Your line is open.","Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. My first question is on addressable advertising. I know that you guys had rolled it out recently to more Spanish-language networks. So now that you've expanded it, I was wondering if you can provide some color of your efforts there, how you see the monetization opportunities going forward and I think a few years ago, you guys and DIRECTV also were collaborating on addressable. I think that was specific to the political campaign. But I don't know if you've expanded that effort during this election cycle post the DIRECTV\/AT&T merger. So overall, I would appreciate some additional perspective on all of your efforts in that area.","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","Hi, Tuna. This is Tom. Yeah, we formed a JV, if you will, with AT&T to address \u2013 sorry to use the term \u2013 address the political market in using the addressable technology, and it was quite successful for us. We're seeing similar demand this year, and we're still collaborating with them jointly, and obviously we're right in the heart of the political season. So we're encouraged by where we are on that front.","In terms of DISH addressable, we have expanded the number of markets over the last couple of years, very encouraged by both the CPM growth as well as the possibility to expand to additional markets. So the technology is now mature. Yet we are in a sales cooperative there with others in the industry, and I would expect that you'll see more of our inventory moved into addressable and away from the spot market based on the positive developments that we've experienced so far.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And this is Charlie. I think the bigger picture is that there are things \u2013 obviously the biggest synergy is you could merge the two satellite platforms together, but short of that, there's still quite a bit of synergy where neither company would \u2013 neither AT&T nor DISH would have a marketing edge against the other company. And certainly combining advertising resources and utilizing the number of DVRs and addressable technology is certainly a place that could be growth for both companies. And the other big thing is the backhaul. We all backhaul from \u2013 we're the only two companies that really have connected to all the broadcasters in the United States. And that's a redundant network for both of us, and obviously that could be shared particularly since AT&T has a lot of backhaul resources themselves.","So there's probably a fair amount of synergy in that with no competitive advantage to either company. In fact, it'd improved customer service for both our companies to look at those kinds of things and those kinds of things can be looked at external to the \u2013 while we're in a quiet period, there are other parts of both our companies that can talk during the quiet period on those kinds of things, and I would expect that that's something that at least internally we've looked at and think it makes a lot of sense. I won't speak for AT&T.","Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC","Okay. I know you've come a long way in terms of your technology, but do you still see any major technological hurdles at this point? And also related to that, where are you booking those revenues now? I realize it's still relatively small, but I'm trying to get a sense of if you can give us some color to quantify or \u2013 where you're booking them in other revenues?","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","No, we book the addressable advertising or advertising of revenues in general, in the subscriber-related revenue line.","Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC","So it's in ARPU?","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","It is in the ARPU, right. And it is a small driver of incremental ARPU year-over-year.","Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then last question. Charlie, just a little more color on your comment about the Tribune and NFL Network dispute. Is it something that you expect to linger for a while? And can you provide some perspective of how we should think about the second half subscriber impact that this might have?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Well, I don't think this \u2013 first of all, subscriber impact of any kind of takedown of popular channels is never positive. So, although the marketplace is getting a bit more fragmented, and of course networks are continuing to lose market share, so it's not as impactful as it maybe has been in the past. But it certainly can have a negative impact.","The two \u2013 two really different contract negotiations. One is, within NFL, it's a bit more, in a funny sort of way, positive in the sense that we're spending a lot of time trying to think of how we can do things together on a broader picture and a bigger picture way. And it's not as much about dollars and cents. It's a bit more strategic, I would say.","I think with Tribune, it's an honest disagreement on pricing. And it's \u2013 we do hundreds of retrans deals, so we know where the marketplace is. And we think that they're out of line on where they're trying to go. And they're complicated, because they're a tweener. And by that, I mean, if you just have networks for retrans, if you just have the Big Four networks, that's kind of one set of contracts. And there's another set of contracts where you can have those and others that have (26:15) \u2013 not only do they have the networks, but they have other channels like NBC has USA Network. And so it gets tied up in a bigger negotiation.","Tribune is kind of in the middle. And they have WGN America where they've strategically tried to launch, to take that channel from a superstation and tried to make that into a popular entertainment channel. And they've invested to do that. But it's not a super popular channel for DISH customers and we certainly wouldn't see the same value in that channel. Our customers wouldn't see the same value in that channel as they would. And so it would be a little bit easier if we were just talking about network channels. Or if we were just talking about WGN America that it would be a lot easier to get to more common ground there. But I think when you put those two things together, you end up with a wide gap and disparity in terms of where both companies see the values. So that takes a bit more art of compromise to figure that out. And that sometimes takes time.","Tuna Amobi - Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from Walter Piecyk, BTIG. Your line is open.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Just generally on the use of cash going forward. Any view on \u2013 all things considered, obviously, you have this auction going on. You have your leverage where it is. Whether you would consider additional secondary market purchases of spectrum with obviously LightSquared being one of the larger ones, larger possibilities that are out there.","And then I guess more in the intermediate term, if you are able to sell assets and have a much different cash position, does that cash come to the shareholders, or is the debt leverage on a gross level something you maintain with your existing pay-TV business, and then basically just give that cash to the shareholders instead of paying back some of this debt that you used to purchase some of these assets in the first place?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","This is Charlie, Walt. I guess I'm going to have to answer the question a little bit fairly broadly. But I think, A, there's a number of opportunities out there we see in the marketplace. And we think \u2013 and we look at mostly opportunities that would fit into something that would be \u2013 something that we, A, have an expertise in; and, B, would be synergistic to what we do today. We kind of see ourselves as a connectivity company, or transitioning to a connectivity company. So anything in that realm, and that's a lot of stuff, is interesting to us. And obviously, when we look at those things, we look at certain things strategically long-term. But some things you might look at might be accretive day one, some might be dilutive day one. But we'd look at it long-term and say is that a good business that we should get into?","And we're one of the few companies that really is able to think long term and execute long term. I mean, it took us almost four years to design and build satellites to get in the DBS business, and we didn't have much going on for those four years. The big DISH business was \u2013 we weren't putting new money into the big DISH business even though it was a very robust business two years before the launch of DBS.","It was still a robust business, but we knew that the industry was going to change. And we put our money into where we thought the future was going, and I think that's really what we're doing. And obviously spectrum has been a piece of that. Sling is a piece of that and there's other things that we think makes sense in that realm. And our \u2013 today you probably wouldn't be buying back debt because for the most part, that's gotten over par, and as long as we have use for the money, we think we can get better return than what we pay on the interest, that's more likely where we'd go.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","So one of the uses could obviously be giving it back to shareholders as well rather than just paying it back?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we always look at that. I think as management we'd say, if we have a dollar to spend, what's the most efficient way for us to \u2013 can we invest that dollar and make more money then returning it to shareholders or can we not? And each day might be different. The board might come to a different conclusion, but heretofore for the most part, right, we have decided to reinvest that as management. I think we've \u2013 over the last 20 years, we've paid dividends three times or four times where we thought at least based on where we were at that point in time that was the right thing to do.","Sometimes it was tax motivated because the tax law was going to change, and sometimes it was \u2013 we had more than enough capital to do anything we could see on the horizon. So our first priority is, can we deploy the capital at a greater return to our shareholders than by paying a dividend or buying back stock? If not, those become serious considerations, and we've bought back stock and paid dividends in the past.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Got it. And it doesn't sound like you're ruling out LightSquared. Obviously, they've made some progress with the GPS community. Your view on that spectrum was very different a year or so ago. So now I guess is this a change that maybe you won't necessarily definitely pursuing it, but something you won't rule out if you could get it at the right price?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think \u2013 LightSquared is \u2013 we're fairly knowledgeable about LightSquared, obviously, and I've got the cuts and bruises and stitches to prove it. But it's obviously spectrum. It obviously has some value. They obviously have challenges with interference that they're working to overcome. It's something we look at. I think it's maybe more likely that one of the incumbent players would be more interested in that, but \u2013 than we would, but it's certainly an asset that's in the connectivity space.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Got it. I think Rich wants to ask something on Trib. Rich, you on?","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Yeah. I just wanted to follow up on Tribune because, Charlie, you've talked before that when you drop something, you don't look back any more, that it's purely an economic equation and there is no going back. Is this different in some way that you would look back and you are still actively interested in adding Tribune stations and WGN back to DISH? And I guess in the context of this is it would seem like most of the sub losses that you experienced from a drop happen pretty quickly. Just looking, listening to Jerry Kent and what happened at Suddenlink, at what point is it not even worth negotiating anymore because the subs that you've lost are lost?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, you're right in the sense that if we ever get into a takedown situation, we have to be prepared that we will never put that channel back up again. So obviously, we were so far apart with Tribune that, that was the situation that we were in. It's a little bit \u2013 and I would say for WGN America, it's probably in that realm of anybody who wanted WGN America has probably left us. We don't think that's a big number, but they've probably left us. And so the value of putting WGN America back up is declining by the day, right?","And on the \u2013 but on Fox and NBC and ABC channels at Tribune, or CBS channels that Tribune owns, that's probably not \u2013 it's probably going to approach the point of no return as football season comes online, but because it's during the summer, it's \u2013 Fox and CNN News is getting more covered, people watching today than the network. So it's not as big an impact, and so there's probably still time to piece something together. But we're certainly prepared to live without Tribune and WGN America as a company. We know we'd lose some subscribers as a result of that. We'd save a lot of money in terms of fees, and we're certainly prepared for that.","If there's a deal that can be done that's in the market \u2013 that's market price and takes into consideration the expenses that we've had up to now. For example, we've shipped out an awful lot of offer antennas, so a lot of our customers today don't need satellite to get the Tribune channels. Then maybe you can piece something back together again. It's never good for, this is like a strike, right? Nobody \u2013 once you go on strike, nobody ever gets back to where they could've been if they could've resolved it beforehand. But when you have honest disagreements between where people think the market is, for whatever reason, somebody's dad is wrong or somebody's dad is different, then disputes happen.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","But in terms of this being one of the largest interruptions of broadcast television in history \u2013 I mean, this has gone on for five plus weeks, it sounds like the losses to date have been pretty minimal on your business.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, I think you have two kinds of losses. One is churn and one is the inability to attract new customers. You look at both and you look at the impact on your customers. But you also look at the fact that maybe you don't have to raise price for your customers, and that has a longer-term impact on your customers. So you've got to balance those things out. And it'd be easy if we were a penny apart. It'd be easy, right? But when you're tens of millions of dollars apart \u2013 we know, this isn't our first rodeo. We know when a deal makes sense. We know when a deal doesn't make sense.","So at this point, we believe long-term, right, based on what we've been offered, the long-term proper answer is to live without them and take care of our customers that we can with an offer antenna, and then perhaps to replace the WGNA product with other product that there's a serious amount of interest in other programmers to replace that product. And we would have higher ratings and lower cost than WGN America. So that's what we'll look at.","Having said that, Tribune's been a good partner for a long time. And we use data from the company, we've been with that company a long, long time. We don't walk out the door easily. But if they kick us out the door, then the door shuts, then so be it. But we go the extra mile with partners that we've been with a long time. I mean, we're probably stupid \u2013 we're probably stupid to do that. But we've spent an inordinate amount of time talking to people who helped us build our business, and Tribune's one of those.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Thanks so much, Charlie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. So over the course of this call, we've heard you talk about how your linear business is in a mature market and how your streaming business is in a fragmented market. And typically when we see those conditions, industries consolidate. And so I'm curious, do you think one or both of these industries that you participate in should be or need to pursue consolidation? And if so, what would be your goals if you proactively sought it? And I guess as a subset of that, do you think regulators would even allow any of this?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","This is Charlie. (38:19) Tom, if you want to jump in. I would say that there probably will be consolidation within the video business, because I think there's just some synergies between OTT and linear, and even linear and linear. So I think there will be consolidation. And I think that regulatory issues will probably be less of an issue in a mature market than it would be in a growing business, particularly if consumers have multiple choices that they didn't have in the past.","So I think there will be consolidation. And there probably will be \u2013 I think there will be a lot of people who started an OTT business and there'll be consolidation of that business between players. But some people will get it right and some people won't. Roger and his team have spent a lot of time on the technical side. They still have work to do, but it's not easy. It's not easy to work on \u2013 to have live TV on multiple devices that all have different operating systems and different coding requirements. And it's not easy to insert advertising on the fly. And it's not easy to respond to consumers who sometimes have their broadband connection go out or sometimes have conflicts \u2013 appears that your channel has that issue and it may or may not be outside your control. So there's a lot of things that do that. There's blackouts for sporting events that consumers don't understand, and if you make one mistake, it's on the Internet.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So these customers are on broadband. I think they have their Twitter button ready to go, and as soon as they have a buffering, they're hitting it, which is good for Roger's team to have to be at a different standard. But it is a much, much higher standard for OTT than it is for linear television. I mean, we all remember every time it rains, there's a hurricane, your cable goes out or your satellite goes out or somebody cuts the fiber connection or the cable and it goes out. Sling doesn't go out very often for multiple tenants.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Would you ever consider separating your video businesses if that facilitated consolidation? Or do you think and inevitably these businesses feed on each other and they're better off together?","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","Brett, this is Tom. I think, as you know, we're going to do what's best for shareholders in the long run and assess opportunities as they present themselves.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks for taking...","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","The assets were built to go together, but as the world changes, sometimes one asset is more valuable to somebody else and it's less valuable to you. Then you can do some things differently. I think we're confident and our board is confident to look at all those opportunities.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you for taking those questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick, JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Just to go back to the DBS business a little bit, Charlie, you've talked quite a bit over the last couple of years about how when you came back you thought that the business had gone too far out on the credit curve, gotten too aggressive, and it seems like for the last year you've been sort of backing off. I wonder if this quarter is an indication that you decided that we needed to be even more careful with credit, spend even less acquiring a customer. And so is this sort of a new normal level? Or is this a bit of a blip given price increase, increased competition, et cetera? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I would say on the credit side, I think we made those changes in a pretty timely manner. I think on the retention side I think there was discipline that was a bit out of control in terms of the amount of credit you would give. In other words, we were making pretty good choices in terms of bringing new customers in, but we weren't making as good of choices in terms of upgrading customers or giving credits.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So if you gave a credit to your customer where you suddenly were not even covering your variable cost, right, it should be no surprise to you that when you give a customer credit, when the credit's over, they call you up and ask for another credit. So strategically, that was a bit out of control. But I think it's more the other factors I talked about, which is price increase and very competitive. The AT&T\/DIRECTV consolidation, some of the things they were doing along with cable having advantage with broadband, I think all those things still continue to be headwinds kind of where we're going. And I think strategically one of the things that we've done differently is rather than give credits to people, it's really more about rightsizing that customer into the programming that they actually watch. And in that regard, we made great progress in the sense that we're rolling \u2013 we are rolling out now at least on the retention side packages where we can right size the customer that we had kind of resisted that that's probably my fault in terms of resisting that, really trying to work with the content guys not to go in that direction, but we just didn't get enough support from the content guys to allow us to do it. And it makes sense for us to give a credit and pay all the costs to the content guys. At some point we had to reduce the content for consumers.","An example would be somebody who doesn't have children maybe doesn't necessarily want to pay for children's programming or somebody who's in a retirement home and doesn't watch sports, why they pay for sports? So I think we've done a pretty good job on the retention side now of giving \u2013 of having alternatives for customers that fit their budget and give them more flexibility in the choice of what they're doing.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. And then a little more strategically, you've talked in the past about interest from foreign or technology players to get involved in wireless. Have you seen any increase or falloff in that interest in the last few months?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Phil, I think because of the anti-collusion period, we're going to steer clear of post-auction industry structure opportunities as directed by the anti-collusion rules.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. If I look at the last two quarters, and we just assumed that we're sort of in a new norm, so churn would stay elevated, subscriber-related expenses would be more or less steady as a percent of revenue. Am I correct in just thinking about DISH as a positive low-single digit or mid-single digit EBITDA growth company? I mean, Charlie, is this your strategy? And I have another follow-up.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, our strategy is not to be a low-growth EBITDA company, right? Our strategy really is to be a high-growth EBITDA company, but over the long term, Marci. So I think you would say that that it \u2013 we can grow EBITDA in the linear business, but it would come at the expense of cash flow, so given those choices, we would tend to go more towards cash flow.","And second, Roger and his team have work to do to be successful, but we do see that as a growth opportunity. And once you have the finished product, that business is going to grow quite rapidly, and a lot of things have happened. But the content owners fought that technology for a long time. Now Roger has more people who want to get on the platform that he has room for. The technology side's still not where it needs to be. There's still the RS-DVR technology which Roger and his team have not rolled out. They still have standards they have to set for dynamic ad insertion, which is another revenue opportunity for our content partners and for Sling. And they still have to prove they can take a big event and get millions of people watching without significant service interruptions.","So it's still not going to be a finished product for a while, and we're educating ourselves and we're educating content providers because they all do it different. We get the advertising from multiple sources and different formats, and that doesn't work very well when you try to go into multiple devices and try to insert an ads when you don't know when the timeout's going to be.","So everybody does blackouts differently. So at some point, there has to be some compromise to get stuff on more standardized platforms and as new people come in like Sony and DIRECTV and maybe Hulu, you'll start to see that standardization because everybody's going to have that same problem and then everybody's going to figure out we really do need to solve the problem. So a lot of work to be done there, but it's got a bright future. OTT has a bright future, and Roger and his team will have a bright future if they execute.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess they disconnected, I think, the market believes that your EBITDA is actually going to go down, and so it sounds to me like even as you're going through this growth stage or transition stage, we should assume that your EBITDA is actually going to be up?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think our EBITDA is going to be up in the long run. That's the only thing I can say. I mean, that's what we focus on as management. I don't worry about quarter to quarter, but I think we have to put the things in place that we're prepared for where things are going and take advantage of it. And when you do, and you go the right place and you get your company in the right place, things happen in a positive way pretty dramatically.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And my second question is unrelated. The designated entity lawsuit. Do you have any update there? Any sense of timing? I feel like a lot of the wireless companies are getting ready to bid for the AWS free licenses, and I would assume if you lose and they go up for auction, something like that would happen after the incentive auctions? So we'd be in another quiet period?","R. Stanton Dodge - Secretary, Executive VP & General Counsel","So, this is Stanton, Marci. There's really no update other than all the briefs have been filed on the appeal, but we don't have a date set for oral argument yet.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","R. Stanton Dodge - Secretary, Executive VP & General Counsel","So it's TBD at this point.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Jason Kiser - Treasurer","Operator, I think we have time for one more from the analyst community.","Operator","We will now take our final question from the analyst community. And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Your line is open.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Great. Since I'm the last question, two quick ones, if I may. Charlie, if you sort of failed to do anything else with your spectrum by the time the last build-out requirements loomed, how long would it take you to meet those build-out requirements with some sort of a safe build in order to hang on to it? And in looking at the \u2013 what LightSquared was able to do with the CCI spectrum, it looks like they managed to a safe build for about $34 million. I'm wondering if it \u2013 what it would cost you to do that. And then the second question is, is there value in \u2013 once LightSquared's spectrum has gone through its various processes to incorporate that into Band 70 to make a bigger band, would it be worth going back through a 3GPP process in order to increase the size of that band? Or is Band 70 basically done?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So the build-out, I think \u2013 I guess there's the half-empty people out there, but the build-out is still a long way away, and obviously, as you correctly point out, people do things to save their build-out requirements relatively inexpensive. That is not where we're head \u2013 we hope we're headed, doesn't mean that that's not a possibility. But we think that with 5G coming and the timelines being about right period of time that there's a lot that can be done there. Part of the build-out \u2013 the best way to build out is to build out with somebody else who's also building out so you get some synergy in the build-out. And that's \u2013 once the quiet period's over, that's a bit more logical way of looking at it. But you can rest assured that we're not going to risk tens of billions of dollars of spectrum value without making sure that we meet every obligation that we have.","In terms of Band 70 is set, but obviously to the extent that there's a strategic reason to go to a new band that might \u2013 in other words, might include Band 70 and other spectrum in a new band at 3GPP, that's not something \u2013 I mean, that's something we'd certainly look at. I mean, I think it's one of the things that's been so positive in the last quarter where Band 66 was approved, and 70 by 90 with \u2013 our AWS-3 and AWS-4 downlink spectrum should be \u2013 right, we have an expectation that that will be in the vast majority of radios and handsets long before we launch the service. And that's big because the day you launch the service, it means you can get revenue as opposed to having to seed the market for years to get your spectrum in the handsets.","And then the finalization of Band 70, which is our other AWS-4 spectrum, is positive. So we're making a lot of progress on the things that we can, and it's a bit unfortunate that the incentive option has a quiet period. And it's a little bit unfortunate that we've been in the quiet period for the vast majority of the last two years or three years. But we expect there'll be a little bit of a break and \u2013 think there'll be a little bit of a break in that.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","We will now take questions from members of the media. Our first media question comes from the line of Scott Moritz from Bloomberg. Your line is open.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Thank you. Hi, Charlie, guys. Appreciate this chance to ask a question. I'm curious as you folks try to improve the quality of your customers, what you think of Comcast's announcement today about wanting to get into a prepaid cable and Internet offering through Boost Mobile?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","This is Charlie. I haven't seen the announcement, but I think if you're going to go to a less credit-worthy customer, prepaid is a good way to do it. We do some of that today at DISH. Again, there are profitable customers in the prepaid world, and certainly in the wireless world. And I wouldn't \u2013 I would think that that is something that would make sense for Comcast to look at. I guess I could add you're probably not dealing with the $1,000 SAC to get that customer. So I think you have to balance your SAC versus your churn rate versus your ARPU and margins, right? It's a different customer.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And your next media question comes from the line of Malathi Nayak from Reuters. Your line is open.","Malathi Nayak - Reuters","Hi. This is Malathi from Reuters. Thanks so much for taking my question. My first question is for Charlie in relation to the 27 build-out requirements. What is your thinking ahead of that? Have you begun any preparation? As we sort of get closer to that deadline, what are you guys doing and thinking? Second question is for Roger. I was curious to get your thoughts. You talked about the seasonality that you're seeing with Sling TV. What should they be doing? We saw with Netflix, they're really struggling to bring new customers on board. I was wondering if you guys are taking any specific steps in terms of churn and how to tackle the seasonality. Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure I'd \u2013 I think you were asking about 2017 build-out? Yeah, I think it's kind of misunderstood, I think, by a lot of people. But we have \u2013 there's usually multiple interim \u2013 there's only one build-out deadline for us. And that's essentially...","Malathi Nayak - Reuters","2020...","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","2021 is the first one that we have. But there is an interim step that you can build out, and if you do, then your deadline is, for the final build-out, is 2021. If you don't build out an interim build-out, as you referred to in 2017, then your 2021 build-out, for some of our spectrum, would be 2020. So because of the advent of 5G and the just-recent 3GPP approval of our spectrum, so it's not in handsets today. It is not logical, I think, that we would build out in 2017 for an interim deadline. And it's more logical to assume that at least for some of our spectrum, our AWS-4 spectrum, we will have a 2020 build-out requirement.","But we will have no effect on that. I mean, there's no effect on us if we don't build out in interim in 2017. So I think the proper way to look at it is, is that our first build-out requirement is 2020.","Malathi Nayak - Reuters","But even in terms of 2020, I'm trying to get a sense of what, sort of, your thinking is, as you sort of prepare for even the 2020 deadline.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, again, I think I answered the question earlier. But we're not going to risk tens of billions of dollars of spectrum because of a build-out. But there we certainly will \u2013 we believe that we'll build out into a business that's good and we think we potentially will do that with others, right? But there are many options available to us. And there's always a failsafe option of building out a network that meets the FCC qualifications at a much, much, much, much reduced price, if you didn't have anything else that happened which we don't think is going to happen.","But I guess for the people who are always looking for clouds and the worriers, I guess you always look at the worst case scenario in that respect. And I think if that's the way you want to look at it, it's a \u2013 that the earlier questioner summed it up where he said LightSquared met a build-out requirement for something like $34 million, right? So there's lots of options available. I don't think build-out schedule should be something that would be a big worry today to investors. Roger?","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","Yeah, so on your question about seasonality for OTT, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing secular growth really in that industry. But we are \u2013 we know that we're subject to some seasonality, in particular, because of sports. So when we launched Sling, it was primarily a sports offering. Very strong sports content with ESPN and all the March Madness basketball that we carried. Over time, we're migrating to more general entertainment content.","You see, just in the last several months, we launched Fox, we launched NBC, we launched Viacom. And I think that will help over time smooth out some of the seasonality. But I do think that, as Charlie mentioned earlier, the fact that the great thing from a consumer standpoint about OTT services is you can turn it on and off whenever you want. From our standpoint, there's really very little cost of a customer turning on and off. It's not like on our linear business where we have set-top boxes and installers involved. It's all just down to the Internet in managing your account. So I think we'll always see some of that seasonality, because it's the nature of this business. I do think over time, as our content offer gets a little broader, it probably helps smooth that out somewhat.","Malathi Nayak - Reuters","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","And your next media question comes from the line of Mike Farrell from Multichannel News. Your line is open.","Mike Farrell - Multichannel News","Hi, guys. I just had a quick question. Comcast just recently formed the Comcast Mobile for its \u2013 I guess, initially for its MVNO agreement with Verizon, but eventually for its mobile plans. Just wondering if that creates a sense of urgency on your part as to what you do with your spectrum, or does it, I guess, create another potential buyer for it?","Thomas A. Cullen - Executive Vice President-Corporate Development","Hey, Mike, this is Tom. Similar question was asked earlier. Obviously, Comcast is also a registered participant in the auction. So because of the anti-collusion rules, we can't really comment on opportunities or post-auction industry structure.","Mike Farrell - Multichannel News","Okay. Thanks.","Jason Kiser - Treasurer","Yeah. Operator, we have time for one more from the press.","Operator","And your last media question comes from the line of Jeff Williams from Satellite Business News. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Williams - Satellite Business News, Inc.","Charlie, thanks. Can you give us a reaction on what you thought of the FCC deciding not to make any changes to the retransmission consent rules? And also, one other thing. Can you talk about what the decision \u2013 or why the decision to not break out the Sling TV numbers compared to the DBS numbers?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Jeff, you finally got through on the question. Congratulations.","Jeffrey Williams - Satellite Business News, Inc.","Yeah.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","We don't break out the Sling numbers because we see the customers as being comparable \u2013 the SAC is less, the ARPU's less, but they're comparable from a balance sheet perspective. On the \u2013 what was it?","Jason Kiser - Treasurer","Retransmission.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Oh, on the retransmit. I think it's \u2013 I don't know what the thinking was. Some of the thinking was that I think they came to the conclusion that they had the totality of the circumstances. They have really all the ability they need to look at that \u2013 both parties have an obligation of good faith. And so I think they may feel like they have what they need to properly look at it. It could be that the broadcasters put enough pressure on that the FCC's got other things on their plate that that's not the place they want to go with all the other things they got going on with priority perspective.","So we don't really know. I mean, obviously, there's something in front of the FCC with Tribune today, and it'll be interesting to see what conclusions they come from that. But this is a consumer FCC, and they've talked about consumer almost from day one. And obviously this is \u2013 at least from a video perspective, probably the number one issue facing consumers today because \u2013 and I don't see it getting any better. So we would encourage \u2013 you know, look, the best thing is for companies to talk to each other and reach deals, right, and not have government involvement. That's the best thing.","But short of that, there should be a mechanism to resolve disputes. And we've been very vocal about the fact that baseball arbitration is a good way to do it. And by baseball arbitration, I mean each side picks a number of what they think they should be paying, and the arbitrator has to pick one of those two numbers. And when you do that, people get pretty close before you ever go to arbitration, and nine times out of ten, they resolve the issue without that. It's just a stimulus to get to a deal that makes sense in the first place without \u2013 and the consumer never loses their channel. Now we've done \u2013 the baseball arbitration is something that Comcast signed in the consent decree. Regional Sports have had it in the past. It's worked very well in the marketplace. Broadcasters typically haven't wanted to go there, and Tribune didn't want to go there. But that to us seems like a more reasonable approach to solving the problem.","Jeffrey Williams - Satellite Business News, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, everybody.","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Operator, that concludes the call.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call.

As most of you are aware, in early March, DISH signed a long-term programming contract with the Disney company. This agreement gives DISH the carriage rights of the soon-to-be launched Southeastern Conference Network and the Texas Longhorn Network. When combined with our nationwide availability of the Pac-12 Sports and the Big Ten Networks, DISH is the favorite destination for college sports fans everywhere.","This fall, we will offer more football games, both NFL and college, than any other pay-TV provider.

All will be included at no extra charge for new qualifying DISH customers this fall.","As an added bonus, to help celebrate the launch of the Southeastern Conference Network, new DISH qualifying customers will also receive an SEC school flag of their choice, like Kentucky, Tennessee or any other of the Southeastern Conference schools, absolutely free.","Now we're making the same consumer offer for the Pac-12 and the Texas Longhorn Networks as well. Our national multi-sports promotion will be supported by national, regional and local television, national and local radio, billboards and print ads. Yes, DISH is ready for the fall in a big way when it comes to sports.","So now let's move on to the second quarter. We faced aggressive promotions, a weak economy and merger mania in the second quarter. Of course, this is traditionally a soft sales period for the industry. In pay-TV, we lost 44,000 customers, which was 34,000 less than we lost in the second quarter of 2013.","In spite of this general industry sales slowdown, we were pleased with our churn results of 1.66%, slightly better than our second quarter churn of last year. So we stayed the course, growing our base of high-value customers and increasing the percentage of customer activations with HD, DVR and IP connections.","Also in the second quarter, we continued to experience broadband growth in both dishNET satellite and wireline businesses, which somewhat offsets the softness in our core pay-TV business. We added 36,000 broadband subscribers, growing our customer base to 525,000.","Now this is somewhat lower than previous quarters. However, it is a direct result of normal seasonality kicking in and the sales success in certain geographical markets that are now filling up the satellite beams, thus limiting supply. Now we expect these capacity issues will be addressed when both Hughes and ViaSat launch their next-generation high-powered satellites in late 2015 or early 2016.","Now given some of the demand restrictions, we've tightened credit qualifications and scaled back promotional discounts. Now while all of these are prudent moves, it will moderate our sales in the short term.","So with a mature market and a seasonally slow quarter, we still realized efficiencies, lowered churn and improved service call rates. We still have a lot more work ahead of us, but we are on track.","Now to provide you all with additional details on our second quarter performance, here's our CFO, Robert Olson.","Robert E. Olson","Thank you. As Joe noted, second quarter is traditionally a tougher quarter for the pay-TV industry. While we lost 44,000 net pay-TV subscribers in the quarter, this represented an improvement of 34,000 versus last year. The improvement was driven largely by increased new activations. Pay-TV churn was slightly better year-over-year, but up sequentially due to normal seasonality. Our broadband business continued to experience solid growth. We ended the quarter with 525,000 broadband subscribers, up 36,000 net subscribers versus last quarter. We saw higher broadband churn this quarter, partly due to the same seasonality we experienced in the pay-TV business.","Revenue increased $202 million or 5.8% in the second quarter compared to last year. This growth was largely driven by pay-TV ARPU, which was up $3.34 or 4.1% year-over-year. Our broadband business also contributed to the subscriber-related revenue growth, accounting for $45 million of the year-over-year revenue increase.","Subscriber-related expenses increased by 9.4% in the second quarter versus last year. This increase was largely due to higher pay-TV programming expense, but higher broadband subscriber-related expenses contributed roughly 1.3 points of the year-over-year increase. The higher programming costs were primarily driven by increases in our contractual rates. The increased broadband expenses were driven by higher average subscriber levels.","Our pay-TV SAC per activation for the quarter was $846, which was roughly in line with our recent run rate. The year-over-year decrease of $37 was driven by a reduction in manufacturing cost of the Hopper with Sling receiver and a higher percentage of activations with remanufactured receivers.","Satellite and transmission expense was up $31 million sequentially and $45 million year-over-year. These increases were primarily driven by the satellite and tracking stock transaction with EchoStar, which was effective on March 1.","Administrative expenses were down $13 million year-over-year in the second quarter, largely due to spectrum M&A expense we incurred last year. We expect G&A expense to be relatively flat compared to 2013 for the rest of the year.","Depreciation expense decreased $33 million year-over-year as we incurred $53 million of accelerated depreciation last year associated with the TerreStar MSS business.","Both operating income and net income improved significantly year-over-year as a result of the impairment we took on our AWS-4 satellites in the second quarter of 2013. Excluding this charge, both metrics were roughly flat year-over-year.","Net income increased by $37 million sequentially, partially driven by a full quarter impact of our February price increase and by capitalized interest associated with our recently purchased H-Block spectrum licenses.","We generated $168 million of adjusted free cash flow in the second quarter, which was slightly below net income. As I discussed last quarter, there's normal seasonality to free cash flow, with first quarter typically higher and second quarter typically lower due to the timing of tax payments. We expect that free cash flow will be roughly in the same ballpark as net income for the full year 2014.","Relative to our year-end 2013 balance sheet, we saw reductions of slightly over $800 million in cash and marketable securities, driven by our purchase of the H-Block licenses, partially offset by cash generated this year.","Let me now turn it back to Joe before we go to Q&A.","Joseph P. Clayton","Thanks, Robert. In summary, we are focused on continuing to strengthen our best-in-class video experience, to grow incremental revenue streams and to maximize our core pay-TV business, while making strategic investments for future growth.","Thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. Now we'll open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions for Charlie. The first is, Charlie, is there a scenario, any scenario, where you would sell your spectrum holdings and keep the pay-TV business? That's the first question. And then the second question is now that Sprint has walked away from T-Mo, do you have any interest in either pursuing a business partnership or an acquisition with either one of them?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I think nothing's really changed strategically from what we've always talked about, right? And the goalpost of what we might do as a company is we could build out our network by ourselves. Then one unlikely scenario, on the far end of the spectrum, a less likely scenario is we'd sell spectrum, just raw spectrum by itself. And in between, there's a number of partnerships and things we could do that would not only enhance our spectrum and make that -- and use that to our long-term advantage but also enhance what we do in our core business, which obviously is a mature business today. So the answer is -- short answer is yes, it's possible we would sell spectrum by itself. That is not our preference, and that -- I would consider that a personal failure if that's what we end up doing. But we're not suicidal, and the spectrum is very valuable. And if we can't -- if for whatever reason, we can't enter the business and be competitive and make our business better, we know we have a core value floor that has continued to go up and I think will continue to go up. Obviously, on the more M&A side, a lot has happened in the last 24 hours, and we really haven't had a chance to sit down and discuss that internally, but we remain interested in working to enhance our overall business, and that could include looking at the number of companies out there. Obviously, the AT&T-DIRECTV deal have probably lessened some optionality that we had. The Sprint announcement last night probably increased some optionality we have.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","There was some confusion. Have you -- did you look to buy T-Mo in the past?","Charles W. Ergen","I don't think I can comment on that. I mean, I think what I'd say is, it's a relatively small industry. You can assume that everybody talks to everybody. And I think there hasn't been a public disclosure of M&A where DISH probably wasn't A, B, C or D company. But to go beyond that, probably not appropriate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess the first question is for Tom in terms of wireless. You talked about different strategies. But could you see doing anything between now and the AWS auction? Or is it still most important to nail down your spectrum position in AWS before you go anywhere?","Thomas A. Cullen","As Charlie said, the news cycle the last day has been pretty intense, so we haven't really had much of a chance to digest the changes nor, I think, has the market had the chance to digest it. That being said, as you're probably aware, the anti-collusion rules associated with the AWS 3 auction kick in on September 12. So there's really only about 5 weeks between now and then. But in the meantime, we'll, of course, consider our options, as we always do.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then a little more operational for, I guess, for Robert. But last year, we talked about how falling costs on Hopper manufacturing, and certainly to get returns on those, would give you some decisions to make, whether you let SAC costs come down or try and reaccelerate the business. How are you thinking about that today?","Robert E. Olson","Phil, this is Robert. I think SAC will come down, and we've talked about the fact that we get cost efficiencies in our agreement with EchoStar as time goes on, so that helps us out. And then also, we have increased percentages of remanufactured receivers. So I think SAC is a place where we think it will maintain that level for quite a while.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","I guess the first question, just a quick one on the annual meeting. Is there a reason one hasn't been scheduled?","R. Stanton Dodge","It has been scheduled now, and I believe it's reported in the 10-Q. October 31st or 30th? I think it's the 30th.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the...","R. Stanton Dodge","October 30.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then on the strategic partnership front, as far as if you look at the different options that you have, do any of those partnerships do you think require you to bring in a partner, a third-party for capital or expertise in running a business?","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. I mean, look, there's always people that are going to help us and we're willing to take a lot people's help. But obviously, you can look at our balance sheet, we have a fair amount of capital. We are not experts in the wireless business today. I mean, we're not even experts in the video business, and we've been in it for over 30 years. So I think we always are learning stuff. And if people are going to help us and if a business deal makes sense, then that's something we'd consider. I mean, I think what we have to do is go back and read all the analyst reports that come out in the next couple of days, like yours, and then that will give us a path to what we should do. We don't really have a corporate development team here. We just take the analyst reports and summarize them and then whichever one sounds good is kind of what we do. And we just haven't had the chance to summarize those yet.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Well, I'm obviously sure that's not the case. Things -- your tone has changed a little bit as far as the spectrum is concerned. I don't think you were as willing, I don't know, 6 months or a year ago, to maybe sell the spectrum outright. And obviously, that would create a significant taxable gain, given where the implied value is there. So is there a reason there's been that type of tone change as far as the spectrum is concerned?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I think I started to answer the question. There's 2 ends of the goal post, which is how we look at things. One is to kind of go it alone and one would be to sell the raw spectrum. Both of those are relatively unlikely, and certainly, wouldn't be our preferred route. But if you can imagine that you got to a situation where there was no realistic business transaction you could do that can enhance your core business and help you compete in the marketplace, which is what we want to do, and we don't think -- and we didn't think we can make a difference to the consumer, right, we would be -- we wouldn't be hesitant at that point to look at a spectrum sale. And we think that that's not a likely scenario. That's certainly not number one, two or three on what we're focused on. But we have an auction coming up, and Tom may want to comment on this. This'll be a bit longer answer, but the auction is going to tell us kind of where we stand on a baseline value as a company, right? And this auction is the first auction of meaningful spectrum in the mid-band, high-capacity since 2008. And so a lot has changed since 2008. There's going to be a reset of values for this mid-band spectrum. And the reason is because, obviously, we now have the advent of smartphones, we now have the advent of tremendous capacity demands on the network, particularly because of video, and that demand is almost all on the downlink side. And spectrum is typically auctioned off paired, uplink and downlink. In the meantime, DISH has got the option to go all downlink with its spectrum. So we actually have about twice -- we have twice as much downlink spectrum, mid-band spectrum, as is going to be auctioned off in this auction. And as a result of that, it's not going to take a lot of really -- it's not going to take a real mathematician to figure out the value of this when this auction happens, and look at that paired spectrum and pretty much say whatever that value goes for, in general, DISH has probably got twice as much value on its balance sheet. And I think that where people think that auction is going to go is somewhat -- I think, analysts have started to kind of increase where they think that price might be in the value of spectrum. But I think they're still low, and the reason I think they're still low is a variety of reasons, but of course, one is AT&T's acquisition of DIRECTV is a big acquisition for them, but they got no spectrum in that. So their only path to spectrum in the short term for high-capacity spectrum is in this auction. Verizon, I think, has publicly stated that they need more capacity. And T-Mobile now today knows they're probably going alone for the foreseeable future, and the auction's kind of tailor-made for them. They're the ones who really fought hard for this auction, for this particular band, because it fits pretty nicely into where they are. So you can imagine that there's at least 3 players that need spectrum. And of course, DISH looks at every option where there's an opportunity to enhance our position. So I think that, that's going to happen. And the reason our spectrum is probably worth say twice as much as the spectrum auction is because the uplink in this auction is impaired for 3 to 10 years, all right? So it's not going to be usable for a long period of time. The downlink is pretty clean. And the world has changed toward LTE. The most efficient way to do a network is 20 megahertz chunks, and DISH has 2 independent downlink 20 megahertz chunks potentially. And then we have virgin spectrum, so you can build out our spectrum where you need it. You don't have to build at places where you just don't have demand for it. So obviously, the bigger cities is where people are congested today. So there's a lot of good things coming in, so I think strategically, I think we talked about this in the last call, is we don't know what the value of our spectrum is, nobody really does, but I think we're going to know at least in our minds where that spectrum value is going to be by sometime early next year, when this auction takes place. And most of the things that we see -- I think the FCC has done a pretty good job of setting this auction up to be a pretty robust auction. And I think that it's funny, people will be able to play in the auction, almost do an arbitrage of DISH stock because as the value goes up, you'll see it every day and you'll see the closing price every day and you'll get a feel for kind of the value that we have. But I just think that it's underestimated by most analysts. I think -- could be wrong, and we're wrong a lot, but we're pretty confident that we have -- that the value that we have, core value we have, probably exceeds what people think.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And I think Greenfield also wants to hop on with a quick question about the actual business as opposed to the asset value of things.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","When you look at the Sunday Ticket, Charlie, the contract with DIRECTV is ending. The AT&T deal seems contingent upon them renewing it, and while they're in some form of exclusive negotiating period now, just wondering, is there any good reason why the NFL wouldn't wait to see whether you have interest? And is there any reason why you wouldn't have interest? Not only is it a significant number of subscribers, but it also seems so integral to DIRECTV's marketing and this whole transaction with AT&T, why not take a shot at acquiring some of the world's best content?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, again, obviously, we are interested in NFL Season Ticket. We would certainly be interested, if NFL open that up for bidding, we certainly would be a bidder. I think the NFL's dilemma now is that -- I don't think they want to be in a position to sell an NFL ticket where I think AT&T has some 5 million subscribers, and if DIRECTV were to get NFL Ticket on their past plans, they get those 5 million for free. That's number one. So I think NFL has got to take a look at that in terms of perhaps another increase on top of the increase because of the added potential customers to get it. And second, obviously, there are broadband rights and so forth that are more meaningful and more valuable in an AT&T-DIRECTV deal. So the NFL has got to look at that. But they also have contractual contracts in the past, and those contracts sometimes address renewal, and there are sometimes formulas in those. I know there are on the network deals. And so the NFL may have -- while they know that -- they know they're in a very, very strong position to get a material increase in the season ticket price...","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Do you think you get a shot to bid?","Charles W. Ergen","If we do, we will. But there are times, based on contracts, based on renewals, where you don't really get a chance to bid, if somebody meets a certain price. And so we just don't know how that will shake out. But I think DIRECTV, given the fact their merger depends on it, would probably have to be pretty confident that they're in the driver's seat there. It may be contractual. Because you would think the NFL wouldn't -- the NFL probably wouldn't leave -- historically, has not left billions of dollars on the table. And obviously, the NFL Season Tickets is worth billions of dollars more than it was before the DIRECTV merger with AT&T was announced, right? I mean, that suddenly added billions of dollars because you got more customers to go after in broadband, right? So you wouldn't think NFL would leave $3 billion on the table. The players wouldn't like it and the owners wouldn't like it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have 2 questions. I wanted to ask on the auction. Charlie, you have helped us understand that the auction will help us figure out what your stock is worth. I'm wondering what you think the decision tree looks like for you if you end up coming out of the auction with spectrum, a meaningful amount of spectrum or not, since there seems to be a ton of demand, as you pointed out. So there's a potential where the per MHz-POP is huge, but DISH is outbid. And so what's your -- how does that impact your thought process? And then I have a follow-up just on the TSS stuff.","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I would just say if the auction goes for a low price, we'll probably end up with a lot of spectrum. If the auction goes for a high price, we probably won't end up with very much. I mean -- but if it goes for a high price, I think it probably enhances our balance sheet, not detrimental to it. So we feel confident in auctions, we're going to participate. We anticipate participating in the incentive auction, when that happens. We're pretty educated to auction process. We participate, I think, in every major auction that the FCC's had. We normally don't win much, but from time to time, we do. And there's an incentive for us to participate in this auction. So I think it's just the -- I think we have to wait and see, but I think it will be -- it's going to be very interesting because the world's changed since 2008. And this is the first time -- I think AT&T has got to participate in a big way because they have no path to more capacity and you just can't put 100 million -- they only have about 50 megahertz of downlink spectrum. It's really hard to put 100 million people on 50 megahertz. And I think Verizon has got about 50 megahertz of downlink spectrum. They got 117 million people. That's really tough to have a network and you start -- I mean, T-Mo has the highest speeds today. I think that's probably realistic. And I think that Sprint, particularly with the management changes they're making and with the leadership of SoftBank is -- and with their spectrum position, is going to be really, really a fast network, particularly in the big cities. So there's going to be a lot pressure. And the other thing, you got to look at spectrum, which I think one analyst is taking a shot at, but the other way that you can get capacity is you can densify your network. So the big players could go out and build more towers, spend the CapEx and the OpEx to do that, right? And you have to balance, say, getting 10 megahertz of spectrum versus what it would cost you to densify your network to get a comparable 10 megahertz of spectrum. And when you run that math, and again we are not experts in this, but when you run that math, you can pay a lot of money at auction to save that CapEx and OpEx over time. And of course, you buy the spectrum so it probably doesn't go down, so it's shaping up as a pretty -- the FCC just, I think, is going to be pleasantly surprised. I think they've done a good job on this particular auction.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe to rephrase, does the outcome of this auction push you in one direction? You think that those 2 goalposts you laid out; go alone or sell effectively. Does it push you in either direction depending on the outcome of this auction?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I think our dream would be to compete in the marketplace, bring a better product to consumers, be disruptive, be innovative and enhance the video business that we have today. It looks like AT&T paid about 7.5x for DIRECTV's maybe $1,500 a sub, right? So you kind of get a valuation, at least in an acquisition mode, of what video's worth. I think AT&T is smart to think that video is strategically important to a wireless network operator. I think they're going to use that to their advantage. I think that's going to put pressure on people who don't have video assets in the wireless world. I think those 2 things go together pretty nicely because most of the data on wireless networks in the future will be, in fact, video. Let's just take one simple example. 20 years ago, when you were in your house, you -- 20 years ago, when you made a phone call, you only made it one of two ways. You made it in your house on a landline or you put $0.10 or $0.20 or $0.25 in a coin machine and made a pay call. That's the only way you made phone calls. Today, primarily, you only watch TV on the TV set in your house. But 20 years from now, and it's not going to take 20 years, by the way, you're probably going to be watching most of your TV not on the big screen in your house, just as you don't make most of your phone calls -- in fact, you may make none of your phone calls on a pay phone and you may make none of your phone calls on a landline today. So TV is going to follow the phone business, not quite to the degree because you're still going to want to sit in front of the big TV sometimes. But for the most part, the majority of your viewing is going to be on a screen other than the way you watch it today. And that opens up a lot of opportunity for DISH and for our content providers. And so one of the reasons that we're focused on OTT and Joe and his team are focused on OTT is that's a way where DISH and its content providers can start a new service that hopefully is incremental to the business today, hopefully has a different advertising model than the way we do it today with DVRs, and hopefully, it leads to a mobile business or wireless business that's incremental revenue to our content partners. That's the first thing that I've seen that's in the business that's more of a win-win situation with content partners rather than always the zero-sum game you get into when you have a negotiation, where they want $0.01 more, you want to pay $0.01 less. Now we're in a situation where there can be an ecosystem where both the content provider and DISH can both make a $0.01 more based on the way the ecosystem works. So that's the dream for us. We have a vision of that. It hasn't changed in probably 6 or 7 or 8 years. I think we've been talking about it. We don't see anything -- everything we see says that's the right way to go. We don't see anything changing that. But we're a small company compared to these telecommunication giants, and whether we can compete on that remains to be seen.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just on that video front, the A&E deal announced this week seemed to move you guys into a multi-stream product position. I just wondered if you'd comment if that was a step forward beyond the Disney deal. And then what's the timing on launch? I think last call, Charlie, you said, by the end of the year. I just wanted to see if there's an update there.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, so launch, still by the end of the year. The A&E deal and other deals we look at -- every deal is a little bit different for OTT, but Disney remains the core of our OTT deals, and to some degree, I'd say we'll be at the lowest common denominator. And I think one of the things that we'd like to do with our content providers -- we think OTT's a good smart move. We think it's incremental value to both us and the content provider, but we're not absolutely positive. And we know that we're going to be -- we could be disruptive to the current ecosystem. And so we're going pretty cautiously about it with our content partners and the Disney -- what we've talked strategically with Disney is the core strategy of where we're going about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","I'm wondering if I can pick your brain on the regulatory front. If you hold your spectrum, do you think that you would face any regulatory hurdles if you tried selling to a larger player in the U.S.? And I guess would you still rule out AT&T in purchasing your spectrum? And then just stepping back and thinking about AT&T and DTV, it looks like you walked away from DTV. Was that more strategic or something a little bit more on the regulatory front? Just thoughts on that.","Charles W. Ergen","I don't know if Tom wants to jump in. But on DTV, it wasn't a regulatory issue. It was really a valuation issue. The problem we had is the way -- it was really, unfortunately, a timing issue for us because the way we were valued and the way DTV was valued, there was probably a $15 billion gap, $10 billion or $15 billion gap, and we were confident that our value was certainly at least equivalent to DIRECTV, based on the fact that we had a future combining spectrum and wireless and video together, and they were a bit more of a one-man band, right? And so anything that we could've done with DIRECTV, their shareholders would've got 100% of the synergies. And the synergies would have been huge. So -- but their shareholders would have got 90% to 100% of it. So we just didn't think, in fairness, we could ever do a deal where their shareholders got all the synergy and our shareholders didn't get much because the market's a little bit behind on our valuation, or a little ahead on their valuation. And then to their credit, I think Mike White did a fabulous job of timing, and -- which is very traditional, running a great operation, buying back your stock and selling probably perhaps at the peak of -- almost the peak of their business. So to somebody who strategically could use you, right, whereas absent a big acquisition, DIRECTV didn't have a long-term future as a standalone company. So I think they did a fabulous job, and shareholders should be kind of erecting a statue to Mike White and Chase Carey before him, and Eddy Hartenstein. Those guys just built a great business. From a regulatory point of view, I think the regulation that would probably trip up any sale of spectrum, again, that's not where we're headed, but is probably the spectrum cap. And Tom, I don't know if you...","Thomas A. Cullen","Yes, let me dovetail off of that. First of all, I'd remind everyone that the 2 mergers that are being discussed are proposed mergers. And there are very important policies and regulatory issues yet to be resolved associated with both of those proposed transactions. It would be premature for us to think about, down the road, if we were to be in a spectrum sale, what the regulatory outcome would be. Because as we can see in the last year, the industry structure is changing in front of our eyes. And so I think at this point, it'd be speculative to say what might occur in 2015, '16 or '17. But it's -- certainly between now and when we have build out requirements associated with the spectrum, there are many things changing on the landscape.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Charlie, I just want to make sure I understand your vision a little bit better. You've talked a lot about OTT and the interaction of OTT, video and wireless, and you were just talking about it a couple of minutes ago. Is it your vision that the wireless business is a bundling opportunity, that it allows you to be more competitive with a bundle? Or is it a vision that says I need to be vertically integrated into content delivery over my own proprietary network? So unlike Netflix that is network-agnostic, for example, that you'd be building something that is truly network-specific over wireless. Is that latter description your vision for what you want to do with video?","Charles W. Ergen","It could be both. It could be both of your scenarios. But certainly, if you could -- if you had your own wireless network that you could control, that you could give a quality of service to customers that was consistent, that took their home experience and made it exactly the same on all their devices no matter where they are, right, and at the same time, from an advertising point of view, took that mobile content, right -- and your mobile content will be 2 ways: one will be broadcast and one will be peer-to-peer, right? And you might advertise differently on both of those. But when you get into the mobile world, you're on smart devices. And those smart devices, they know who you are, they know where you are through GPS. They know -- they have your credit card information, it's your wallet, it's interactive, so you can actually purchase something. That changes the dynamics for the ecosystem in terms of what amount of money both DISH and the content providers can get, because suddenly, we're in the mobile business, right? And I've said this before, but I think Facebook was, 2 years ago, 0% of their revenue was in mobile. And last quarter, it was 62%. 2 years went from 0 to 62%. Very little of our content providers' revenue today is in the mobile side of the business. And so once we have enough bandwidth and an efficient enough network, particularly enough downlink, then you can offer a great experience on the mobile side, and that's where most of the data is going to be. Data is not going to be in a voice call or a text. So that's the way people built their networks, but that's not the way we build our network. So that's why virgin spectrum in 20 megahertz chunks is so valuable. And it gets more complicated than that, but we think it will be important to pay for a subscription to TV, get pay-TV, get it wherever you are, get it on all your devices and get ads streamed to you that are meaningful to you. You aren't -- 5 years from now, you're just not going to see an ad of an airplane flying with some music saying -- a branding ad that says, fly the friendly skies. Nobody's going to say that. The ad's going to say, book a ticket, push the button and book a ticket, right? That's going to be a better ad, right? You're not going to have a Starbucks ad with somebody sitting behind, talking about we brew coffee. You're going to just push the button to say what size cappuccino do you want. So advertising is going to change, and the difference in advertising revenue is dramatic compared to the linear television experience we have. And I think that advertising model is going to change. And so I think you have to be part of that. And the wireless network is not just what I said about video. The other thing about wireless networks is the number of devices, the number of things that will be connected to the network is going to grow by 10x what it is today. Every car, every pet, every child, every refrigerator, every camera, every security system, every watch, every machine is going to be connected wirelessly to a network, right? And so today, you're seeing growth in wireless on tablets, right? That's where most of the growth is coming from. But in the future, it's going to be all those other devices. Let me take a big step back. What you really have, what you really have going forward, in our vision, is in the palm of your hand, you're going to have all the information of -- all the information in the world in the palm of your hand no matter where you are, right? It's a computer. It's not a phone anymore, it's a computer, right? And it fits in the palm of your hand, and it's getting faster and smarter and better every day. And you're going to have all the world's information. You sit with your -- I sit with my kids and somebody's debating something, who won the 1956 election and somebody says Eisenhower, somebody says somebody else, and somebody just punches it and they'd say, well, it's Eisenhower, right? So I mean, every piece of information, every piece of video is going to be available, that you're going to have access to. And it's going to be great for productivity. Your heart's going to be monitored so we can reduce health care costs. Just everything is going to be connected in a wireless fashion. And most people look at the world as it is today, and they say, right, but I look at it as everything is going to be connected and no matter -- in my lifetime, the only way you get connected is through wireless spectrum. Someday, there'll be some other way to do it. They'll be using photons, there'll be some other way to do it. But in my lifetime, it's going to be wireless, and you're going to want to be connected and you're going to be happy to pay for it. And right now, in the United States, there's 4 companies that can do it.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","That's very helpful. If I could just ask one follow-up though, as it relates to that. So you talked a lot about spectrum comps, which I guess are an appropriate valuation methodology if you're going to be selling your spectrum. But I'm trying to reconcile how you think about the value of the spectrum as a commodity versus the present value of what you do with it if you put it to work. Because it sounds like what you're describing is putting it to work rather than in a transaction.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, you've asked the fundamental question, Craig. You asked it the way, I think, the way we look at it. We look at the fundamental value. The floor value's what you could sell it for, right? So we're going to have an auction, whatever that auction goes for, multiplied by 2, that's the floor value, right? Then we look at it as businesspeople, and Joe and his team and we look at that and say, unless we can build a business that's more valuable than the core value, we're a seller. But if we can build a business long term that's actually more valuable than the core value, then we're going to go do that, right? So we bid for a satellite spectrum auction back in 1998 or something, the first one, right? We believed that the value of the business we could build with that spectrum was more than the $670 million that, that actually went for, right? We would look at it -- I'll make it up. If you said our spectrum is worth $50 billion, right, and we could sell it for $50 billion, we look at that on the one hand. And on the other hand, we'd say, can we take that 50 -- can we take that spectrum and build a business that's more than $50 billion. And if we could, then we wouldn't sell it, right? And if we couldn't, selfishly, selfishly as a shareholder, we'd sell it, right? And so we don't -- we believe today, based on where we see wireless going, right, that we can build -- we certainly believe we can build a business today more than the value that we get in the marketplace for spectrum today, right, based on whatever -- even if you put 100% of our value on spectrum, it's about, what's that, $30 billion? That's $1 -- $2 a megahertz downlink spectrum, less than that. We think we can build a business more valuable than that. That's our -- we may be wrong, we may be na\u00efve, we may be arrogant, but we're pretty sure we can build -- for those shareholders who want to stay in the long term, we'll build a business more valuable than that. If the spectrum is worth $50 billion, could we build a $50 billion business? We think we can. But we're less confident of that than we are at $30 billion, right? Does that make sense to you? I mean, you balance those 2 things. And our Board of Directors and our management team looks at that and says, what's the best long-term value to our shareholders, right? I mean, I hate to say it, we're just -- we're economic, rational businesspeople. It hasn't changed in 30-something years for those of you guys who have followed the company. We're long-term players, right? We're not a great stock for -- if you want somebody to flip some spectrum, make a quick buck, go buy somebody else. If you want to stick the stock in your drawer, we've done a pretty good job over the last 15 years. And I think our best days are ahead of us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Another one for Mr. Ergen. When we get to the point where you have some sort of service that's available for consumers to purchase, do you anticipate positioning your wireless product as a landline substitute? Or is it more of a complement to your core video business as sort of an out-of-home video product?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, if you're talking about landline for voice, I mean, I think the markets are already...","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, not wireline.","Charles W. Ergen","Are you talking about a cable?","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes.","Charles W. Ergen","I think that they're -- I'm going to throw this back to Tom, but we are experimenting with both Sprint -- one of the great things I love about Sprint is their spectrum is tailor-made, I believe, for many homes to be a substitute for a fixed line to the house for broadband. And we're experimenting both with nTelos and Sprint. I think that Sprint's got a real key asset there. And I think that you can do that for some homes. And then some homes are so densely populated, right, that at least in the foreseeable future, probably running the cable or fiber is probably a better way to do that. Unless you're a low data user, and then I think wireless can be. So for some people who are mostly Internet and not streaming a lot of video, it could be a substitute. But Tom, maybe you want to talk about the trials.","Thomas A. Cullen","Yes, Jason. As you know, we've announced trials with both nTelos and Sprint. We had been waiting on band 41 radios. I'd remind everyone that we're doing these trials on 2.5 spectrum, not our 2.0. But -- so we launched in the nTelos territories. July 15 was the actual first date for customers to sign up. So we're just -- we're adding customers now and installing new ones every day. The primary objective of these trials is to test the business model, i.e. how many customers can you adequately support in how much spectrum depth. Will the model work at 20 megahertz, or does it require 40, or does it require 60? As we've discussed in the past, the demand on spectrum is going to be different, obviously, for mobility in urban areas versus where you may have more spectrum depth in rural areas, you may have excess capacity that you could dedicate to fixed broadband. Again, the primary objective is to test that model. But we think with outdoor antennas on the rooftop, you're going to get better cell radius, the ability to provide more customer coverage off of a single tower, and those are the things that we hope to learn and better define in terms of consumer consumption patterns over the next 3 to 6 months. The Sprint trial has not yet launched, but it's expected to within a month.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich.","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Maybe I'm not understanding something, but as an adjunct to Craig's second question, let's pretend AT&T buys a lot of AWS spectrum, and that's worth what it's worth to AT&T by virtue of having capacity limitation, having 100 million customers already. You're possibly removing a buyer from the market from a regulatory perspective, and you don't have free transferability. It's not a particularly smooth market. Isn't it a little tricky to say that, that spectrum shift that you own should be priced at that level when there might not even be another permissible buyer in the market? Because that is really a matter of you having had a very robust greenfield approach yourself or obviously, much more likely, finding a partner.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, I think you're probably missing how the marketplace probably works. But let's say AT&T buys -- there's 25 megahertz of spectrum, downlink spectrum available, right? So let's say, they get 15 of it, right? And they pay $2 a MHz-POP, right? Then I would say that our spectrum is more valuable than that. One, are they going to get nationwide spectrum, right? Maybe. Not likely. Are they going to get -- if they get 50 megahertz, how much does that leave for Verizon? How much does that leave for T-Mobile, right? 5 for each of those guys? Is that enough in today's world when you have 117 million customers that are using twice as much bandwidth and data every year, right? And then you have to balance that versus how much you have to densify your network and the cost of that. So there's just not enough spectrum in the next auction to probably feed everybody. It probably kicks the can down the road for them for a year. If they get 10 megahertz of downlink spectrum, it probably kicks the can down the road for a year. But 50 megahertz of downlink spectrum could make you a dominant provider. And the second thing is we're 20 megahertz blocks. So you're not -- I'd say it's highly unlikely that somebody in this auction will get a 20 megahertz nationwide block. And LTE, that's the most efficient, that's the fastest speeds you're going to get, that's the most efficient way to build your phone, that's the most efficient way to build your network, right, instead of being Swiss cheese with all different frequencies, where you got to have duplexers and different frequencies in your phones, and all kind of stuff, right? And then it's virgin spectrum too, which this auction will be, but it's virgin spectrum, so you can build it as you need it, right? As you go to -- one thing that analysts haven't picked up on enough is every time you go to another generation in wireless, it's not backward-compatible. So 4G is not backward-compatible to 3G. 5G is not going to be backward-compatible to 4G, which means you have to re-farm your spectrum. It means you have to take down spectrum and re-farm it to the new technology. When you have virgin spectrum, you can just start in the new technology. And trust me, having gone through a transition from MPEG-2 to MPEG-4, and having gone through a transition from SD to HD, it is painful and it is costly. And when you factor in those costs, virgin spectrum starts to look pretty good to you, right? And so -- I don't know, I probably didn't answer your question. But the bottom line is there's just not enough spectrum in the auction to feed everybody. And by the way, if somebody bids $2 and wins, they probably bid somebody -- they outbid somebody who bid $1.95 or $1.98. So somebody wanted it at $1.98 and didn't get it, right? So does that mean your spectrum is worth $1.95? I don't think so. It's worth $1.98 [ph].","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","I really think the values would be radically different to different buyers. But obviously, you know a lot more about this than I do, so I'll defer to you.","Charles W. Ergen","No, I mean, I think that the value will be different to different buyers. The value will be different to different buyers. But I mean, somebody will say they need spectrum in New York because their network is clogged and they don't need spectrum in Grand Junction, Colorado, right? And somebody needs spectrum in Grand Junction, Colorado and not in New York. So the spectrum will be different, but I'm talking in generalization across the whole -- I wouldn't want to go -- I wouldn't want to participate in the auction for the first time, that would be difficult. But I think we've done it enough that we think it's -- and the money's going to public safety, which is a good thing. But we're a small player. We're a small player. My gut feel is the big guys are going to get the vast majority of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Group.","James M. Ratcliffe - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Two, if I could. First of all, I don't know if it's for Charlie or Robert, when you think about capital structure, I mean, clearly, you're sitting on a lot of cash for flexibility at this point. But if the point comes where you don't see a need for a lot of cash and flexibility for wireless and the like, what do you think the right capital structure for the actual underlying DBS and satellite broadband business is in terms of what the right leverage structure for that would look like? And secondly, Charlie, when you think about opportunities and when you think about M&A broadly, how important is it to you to retain the level of control you currently have at DISH in any sort of outcome entity?","Robert E. Olson","So James, this is Robert. I'll start off. We've run the DBS pay-TV business with around $1 billion of cash. Obviously, you can look at our balance sheet, we're up close to $10 billion right now. And Charlie's talked about this before, that absent -- we think we have opportunities to invest, invest in the wireless business. Absent opportunities to invest, there's different things we could look at. We could look at returning money to shareholders. We have a steady stream of debt maturities over the next 5, 10 years, we can look at that. There's a lot of different options, but the preference is always if there's good investment opportunities to invest.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, and this is Charlie. I mean, the level of control -- I mean, obviously, there's a control premium if somebody wants to do something different. But I don't think that we would ever let that control issue stand in the way of a good deal for our shareholders, right? And there's been times in the past, I think -- we had a failed merger with DIRECTV, where that wasn't an issue. So -- but we're going to do the right thing for shareholders, long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisors.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","If I could ask a previous question in a different way. Charlie, I was hoping you might share with us your scenario analysis of the new OTT offerings. So for example, what are you thinking about might be the high and low share expected from the young adult market? And then I have a follow-up.","Charles W. Ergen","I don't know if anyone wants to jump in on that. We don't know. I think our strategic vision is to try to get incremental customers who aren't pay-TV subscribers today. We'd like to get them at a younger age. I'm sitting here looking at some of our interns that are listening -- that are in our -- here, looking at them because they're young. So they probably didn't pay for TV in college except maybe for Netflix, right? We'd like to get them to pay for ESPN and get them started on pay-TV. And then as they move to a house with 3 or 4 TVs, they are already a pay-TV subscriber, they already have channels that they love, and they continue on. And my concern is that today, we're missing that whole generation. And so they come home, they go on the Internet and they watch something for free and maybe they subscribe to Netflix and a smaller percentage subscribe to Hulu or Amazon Prime. The core industry is missing them, so I think we have to do something to try to get them. I think the risk is, of course, you could get people turning off -- people in the ecosystem today downsizing, and we'll have to balance that and kind of see how that plays out. And that's why I think you'll see us go relatively slow at it and kind of see how it goes, but we know that the OTT model is a better advertising model too. So we know there's added revenue from an advertising perspective and we think we can get net incremental subscribers. I think the industry looks like it's relatively negative this quarter. Is that fair? I mean, I assume it is for the pay-TV industry. That's not good, right? And we can do nothing, right, and watch that go into that mature decline cycle or we can come up with new products and see if we can get incremental, that's what we're trying to do.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Right. And then separately, with recent viewing technologies of yours, DISH has not long been really considered ad-friendly. So what conversations have you actually had with advertisers?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, I think the perception is we're not ad-friendly, and I think that's because we haven't been able to get anybody to share our vision that ads can be -- we haven't been in the past, I think that's changed. But I think in the past, we haven't been able to get people to share our vision that we can stream an individual ad to people and not the same thing to everybody. I just don't think that some -- I think some advertising is offensive to people, and I think some advertising just doesn't work as well when you have to advertise to the whole population that's very diverse today, right? So if you -- and so you've got a -- we think technology exists to stream an ad that's meaningful to you that we can probably do -- probably as an industry, we can do fewer ads and we can do more meaningful ads, and net-net, the money could be significantly more. But we've got to add mobile to the equation, we've got to add OTT to the equation.","Operator","We will now take our final question from the analyst community. [Operator Instructions] Our final analyst question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just had another wireless question. You basically said that you'll only get into the business if you have a partner. So what would the ideal partner bring to the table, to the partnership?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, our ideal partner would have a network, our ideal partner would have great management, our ideal partner would have a good capital structure, our ideal partner would have 100% market share. But I think there's a number of people that are potentially good partners, and I think that -- there's a lot of interesting ways that we can get into the marketplace. And I think it's just -- it may not be evident, even to us, until we kind of see how it all shakes out. I mean, obviously, we have to relook at things based on what happened yesterday, the last 24 hours, and I think the auction will be a reset. And then I think we'll have a clear path. And then the incentive auction could be another interesting opportunity, if that happens, right?","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Do you need to get access...","Charles W. Ergen","I think you have to -- I think -- I'll say it this way. I think as an entrepreneurial company, you end up gaining a fair degree of confidence that you can manage your way through this ever-changing landscape. And in fact, the more things change, the more you kind of like it because you're a little bit more nimble, you can move a little bit quicker. We didn't start thinking about wireless yesterday. It's been a long-term -- you go back 6 years and listen to an analyst call, it's been a long-term piece of what we've thought about. I would say that very little has happened in the marketplace that we didn't at least anticipate as a possibility and try to get ourselves in a position that if that happened, we'd be in a good position. I don't think it's a surprise that Sprint's walking away from T-Mo, right? I mean, sometimes the best deals you do are the ones you walk away from. And it takes a lot of guts to do it, but you don't want to get yourself tied up in 12 to 18 months of regulatory only to fail at the end. So that seems to me to be a smart move, but I think it could have been anticipated. I think it probably should've been anticipated because the government -- regulatory officials sent clear messages. So that shouldn't be a surprise to people today, right? And the auction and where the auction goes and how the dynamics of that auction -- shouldn't be a surprise to people when that happens. I don't know what's going to happen, but -- there's a range of things that could happen, but it shouldn't be a surprise. And so I think -- and the way the wireless technology evolves and the way that people use wireless technology, you're not using Google Glass without wireless. You're not having a smart car without wireless. The way wireless evolves and the value of that spectrum that enables you to do it shouldn't be a surprise to people 5 years from now. I don't know how else to say it.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Do you feel that you have to have access to low-frequency spectrum in order to get into the business? Is that a requirement from your standpoint?","Charles W. Ergen","I think ideally, if you're building a traditional network, that you need a balance between low and -- you need coverage capacity, which is low band, and you need mid band to high band for capacity. So the answer to that, I think, is, ideally, yes. Your road is much harder without low-band spectrum. I think the FCC recognizes that in the incentive auction. That's why they partitioned a piece of that for smaller companies or new entrants. But I think it is one piece of strategy that's important. By the way, we have 6 megahertz of low-band spectrum, right, in all but 5 cities. So we're not totally in the dark there.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Is that going to be usable? Didn't the power requirements go down on that?","Charles W. Ergen","We did, we agreed to turn the power limits down to standard wireless power. So we basically had broadcast power. Tom, you might explain that better than I can.","Thomas A. Cullen","No, it's just like Charlie said, we brought them down but to a level that's usable as any other wireless spectrum would be used for traditional wireless services. We just happened to have a very high power limit previously, which would look more like broadcast.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, we're at the same power level as Verizon and AT&T low-band spectrum.","Operator","We will now take questions from members of the media. [Operator Instructions] Our first media question comes from Alex Sherman with Bloomberg.","Alex Sherman","Charlie, just a straightforward question for you. Does it make sense for DISH to make an offer to buy T-Mobile?","Charles W. Ergen","Maybe. We got to read the analyst report to know. Maybe we'll even read the media. And look, I think we've talked about this. Certainly, to the extent that Sprint either dropped out or wasn't interested or the government wouldn't allow it or T-Mobile wasn't, then T-Mobile is something that we'd have an interest in.","Alex Sherman","Does it make more sense for DISH to make an offer to buy T-Mobile than partner with Sprint?","Charles W. Ergen","Don't know. I think Sprint's -- there's a lot of things I like about Sprint. I think they're really entrepreneurial, they've got a -- they've just got a new CEO who's probably the right guy for the competitive nature -- wireless is going to get very competitive, right? It's going to get -- just I'd almost say you aren\u2019t seen nothing yet, right? I mean I think you have to have a lot of respect for what T-Mobile's done and John Legere and his team have done. But I think Sprint is capable of much, much more, right? They have a better spectrum position, more spectrum. And Dan Hesse did a great job in terms of transitioning that company and basically saving that company and he did a great job in selling that company. But now, they've got the right guy for a war, right? And so I like what Sprint's doing -- or I like what I think Sprint's going to do. I don't actually know -- I'm not on the inside there, but I just think that they've got some pretty good weapons.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Liana Baker with Reuters.","Liana Baker","Charlie, I was just wondering how far you'd be willing to go to achieve your wireless plans? You laid out a vision of everything being in the palm of your hand. Would you ever be prepared to separate the traditional pay-TV business that you built from the wireless business?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, I mean, I think we tried to answer that. If we get to a point where we can't enter the wireless business, and there's just not another good option for us, then we'd separate those 2. That is at the far end of the goalpost of what we think we would do. We would fight like crazy and work as innovative as we could not to do that, but if that was our only option, I mean, then -- we're not suicidal, right? I mean, we have a responsibility to our shareholders. We're ultimately going to do the right thing in the long term for our shareholders. But at least, at this point, based on where we're valued today, we think that we can make a difference in the wireless business and enhance the wireless business with our video assets and enhance our video. Our video is worth a lot more money when you can distribute it everywhere than it is if -- today, we're valued because we can distribute our video in the home. But imagine when we can distribute that video to every handset, every tablet in a consistent, quality-controlled manner in a way, with our programming content partners, that the advertising is interactive and unique to each individual. You start looking at -- hey, just go look at the money that Facebook makes from ad insertions and Google and -- I can't even make it up. I don't know how big the number is. It's just a lot bigger than it is today. And so I think that...","Liana Baker","And just on that note, can you elaborate more on that core value floor that you mentioned? You kind of got into that, but is there a current value floor or what is that valued at?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I think I don't know where the -- I think people probably value our spectrum at half of the network -- half of the equity value of the company, something like that, maybe a little more than that, right? When we go to auction, we'll see whether that number goes up or down. But I'd say it this way. If you're in the oil business, we have the largest reserve of oil in the industry right now. We've the largest untapped reserves in the oil industry, right? So unless the price of oil goes down, we have a floor, which is the oil reserves we have. And you have to spend a little money to drill for oil, you have to spend a little money to use our network. But the price of using our network is coming down, right? In other words, the cost of radios on towers and the way you would do a core today in your network and now you can do a smart core and a little dumber radios, the cost of doing that is coming down. So I don't have -- we have an oil -- we have essentially an oil reserve that has a value, unless people quit using oil. And I think people are going to -- in our case, people are going to use more and more wireless spectrum for the foreseeable future. And I don't know if it's going to double every year, but it's going to go up in terms of usage.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Fuller [ph] with CMS [ph].","Unknown Attendee","I was hoping to follow up on the OTT, the Web TV product. Can you talk at all about whether it is a per-person service or a per-household service? There have been questions about that because of the A&E announcement versus the Disney announcement. And we heard Jeff Bewkes earlier today say that the Disney approach was directionally the right philosophical approach. Can you say, by the end of the year, when it launches, what it will be?","Charles W. Ergen","It's basically a per home, but it's -- it's basically per home, but it's really for everybody watching the same channel in the home, right? And it's kind of how -- really how we started out 1980 in the big dish business. We put a dish in. Everybody in the home watched the same channel. And we call that single stream. That's basically the approach, right? I think that we probably should look at -- that's the way we should certainly start. We should look at the experimentation of that at some point in time. I have a concern that you might be watching ESPN on one -- I came from the South, right? And we have mixed marriages in the South in the sense that somebody went to Auburn and somebody went to Alabama and they're married, right? And you can imagine a case where on ESPN, somebody's watching Alabama and on ESPN2, Auburn's on, right? And so you're going to have a divorce, right, if you can only watch one of those games, because if somebody's going to want to watch one game on ESPN and somebody's going to want to watch the other game on ESPN2. So I think those are the things we have to work through, but that's not where we're starting.","Unknown Attendee","But the notion of each person in the family pays for their own services is not where you'll start at the end of this year?","Charles W. Ergen","We haven't made all the final decisions, and obviously, we're talking to our content partners, but I think you would pay by the house and anybody in the house could watch that service -- to watch that...","Unknown Attendee","So in other words, the way you would buy...","Charles W. Ergen","You wouldn't have to buy 1 service, one for the bedroom and one for the living room, but you got to watch the same channel, right? If you want to watch different channels you'd have to -- actually, I don't think we ever thought about that. We just don't -- we haven't thought about actually giving you the ability to buy 2 subscriptions.","Unknown Attendee","It would be revolutionary to have one person-one service as opposed to one household-one service.","Charles W. Ergen","I don't think we've actually -- yes, I don't think we've actually -- that's an interesting question. We haven't thought of it exactly that way. We have really just thought about the household. What we're thinking is -- look, it's college kids in the dorm, it's people in an apartment, it's young people who don't live the same place all the time, they travel around. It's a variety of people who aren't paying for TV today, and we know that's growing by 3 million, 4 million people a year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Farrell with Multichannel News.","Mike Farrell","I just had a quick question about regional sports networks. You see DIRECTV and a couple of other guys have implemented monthly surcharges to offset the cost. I'm just wondering if that's something that you guys are either thinking about doing or have done. And I have a quick follow-up, too.","Charles W. Ergen","Joe, you'd take that?","Joseph P. Clayton","I'll take that. We've watched other pay-TV providers. We have no plans at this point in time to have a separate surcharge, but we're always evaluating changes in the marketplace. But at this time, we have no plans to do that.","Mike Farrell","Okay. I was wondering, too, I mean, in the past, kind of your strategy when there have been networks that you thought were too pricey, you basically just didn't carry them. And there's some talk that you're planning on doing something like that with one of the Comcast RSNs? Is that true? Have you guys just dropped one of those networks?","Joseph P. Clayton","Well, the bottom line is if people want to watch it and they're willing to pay for it, we're going to carry it. We are under some negotiations now with several of the regional sports networks. And I'm not going to go into any of the details of the negotiations, but we're not going to offer something that we can't get a return on. And there's been certain regional networks that we have elected not to provide. The LA Dodgers is probably the best example. It's too pricey and it's too limited, and we're not the only providers, pay-TV providers, not carrying that service.","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. I mean, I think where you'd like to see the regional sports, that -- as a consumer, where you like to see that go is that regional sports would be an a la carte item that you pay a premium for if you're interested in sports. It's really hard to take a fairly narrow set of sports rights, right? It might be just one NBA team, it might be just one baseball team, it might just be one hockey team, and allocate several dollars a month to all your customer base when only a minority of your -- a very small minority watch that particular channel. So we've seen cases, right, we've seen cases where viewership might drop 50%, and they want a 50% rate increase. That just doesn't make any sense. And I think the Dodgers, rather than make every customer pay for the Dodgers even if you're not a baseball fan, it's not just very consumer-friendly. I think the right answer is to have the Dodgers available for maybe just $10 a month, right? But you have the Dodgers available for those people who want to watch. That's a fair way to do it. And if you don't do it that way, people are just going to go to the Internet and watch it anyway. Or they're going to go to their neighbor's house or they're going to go to a bar or a restaurant and watch it. It's just getting too expensive to -- the day of always ever-increasing prices for sports may be coming to an end. Do you have a follow-up?","Mike Farrell","Yes, just a quick one. Just it looks like you guys have done a lot of deals with the college networks, and the ones that you have decided not to carry are the pro ones. Are college networks -- do you see them as being more popular, more desirable with your customer base? And are you kind of trying to position yourself as kind of the college sports place to be?","Joseph P. Clayton","Yes, based upon our consumer profile, our existing customer base, it is in a lot of the nonmetro markets that would be more conducive for college sports, just look at this Southeastern Conference, for example. The majority of that area doesn't have a lot of pros teams. So we are trying to make our programming offerings for our consumers, for our potential customers, as the destination for college sports. And we're the only provider today that has SEC and the Pac-12 and the Big Ten and the Texas Longhorn Networks, all of the above. Other providers have pieces, but not the whole enchilada.","Operator","And our last media question comes from Greg Avery with Denver Business Journal.","Greg Avery","Charlie, given the deadline coming up with the -- for anti-collusion and the auction and the events of yesterday, is there -- how likely do you think there's any deal-making, for either T-Mo or Sprint, will go on before the auction? And what would be your strategic priority, would it be the auction or would it be a partnership?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I think the odds on any big deals prior to the auction are not great, right, unless people really want to do a deal. And most of the time, in deals, people jockey for position for a long period of time. You saw that with Sprint and T-Mobile for a long period of time. And so 5 or 6 weeks is probably not enough time for people to do that kind of thing. If people really want to do a deal, you can do a deal -- I've done a deal on a weekend. So it just depends on the people. But our focus as a company is on the things that we can control, and we can control our participation in the auction. And we think it's something that we will participate in. Again, like I say, we don't normally win very much in an auction. We're just too small. But we will participate -- I think we'll participate.","Jason Kiser","Okay. Thank you, all, for joining us.","Charles W. Ergen","Good bye, thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jason Kiser. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Kiser - DISH Network Corp.","Thanks, Lisa. Thanks for joining us, everybody. Joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman; Tom Cullen, who runs Corporate Development; Erik Carlson, our Chief Executive Officer; we've got Brian Neylon, the President of DISH; Warren Schlichting, the President of Sling; Paul Orban, our Chief Accounting Officer; and Tim Messner, our General Counsel.","Before we get into Erik's prepared remarks, I think Tim has to do the Safe Harbor disclosures.","Timothy A. Messner - DISH Network Corp.","I do. Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. All right. We ask that media representatives not identify participants or the firms in your reports. We also do not allow audiotaping of this call and we ask that you respect that.

Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Well, thank you, Tim. If you tuned into our earnings calls during Joe Clayton's years as CEO, you know he had his own special way of greeting participants, and as you may have read, we lost Joe last Saturday. Far too early. He was a giant in our industry, a passionate leader who left an indelible mark on our company, and so in honor of Joe, I'm going to open with, good afternoon to our East Coast participants, and good morning to those of you on the West Coast. Thanks for the memories, Joe.","I've got a few remarks on our three primary lines. DISH TV, our legacy business, Sling TV and of course our Wireless business, our future business. So, let me start with Wireless first. As you may have seen the news in the last 24 hours, we've announced that Ericsson is serving as a key partner for us in our NB-IoT build-out. Ericsson's assignment is to deliver radio access and core network, and has delivered our national RF plan. Charlie and Tom are both here to take any questions you may have on that front.","Turning to DISH, over the past several quarters I've had the opportunity to highlight recognition our company has earned for its excellent customer service. And once again, I can congratulate our team.","Late in the third quarter, DISH earned J.D. Power's top award in our industry. Number 1 in overall customer satisfaction among national TV providers. The award really recognizes our focus on delivering a top quality customer experience as a premium TV brand. This is an ongoing theme at DISH and its disciplined effort to identify and address our weaknesses, while we continue to build upon our strengths.","Service most certainly is one of those many strengths. So I'd like to congratulate everyone who has worked so hard for that honor, especially our front-line team. Now while we have enjoyed positive churn trends over the past several quarters, churn is a bit more complex this quarter.","Our overall churn rate was 2.11% for the third quarter compared to 1.46% last quarter, and 1.83% in a year ago quarter. While service fundamentals remain in place, we can point to the Univision situation as having contributed to roughly half of the net sub loss in the quarter. Now loss attribution is not a perfect science, and lots of factors go into that data. But that will put you in the ballpark as you work to understand our trending.","Also last week, AT&T pulled HBO from DISH for the first time in HBO's more than 40-year history. First let me apologize to our customers for that inconvenience. I want to be clear on what's behind this. It's not a disagreement over rate for an la carte premium service. This is about HBO requiring DISH to sign up for a guaranteed number of subscribers, and that's really regardless of whether another DISH customer ever chooses HBO. We don't think that's the right deal for our customers, it's definitely not the right deal for us, nor is it likely good for the industry, and we welcome any questions on that situation.","I'd like to conclude with Sling. Sling continues to maintain its leadership position in live, over the top, Internet delivered Pay-TV. The power of live continues to prove itself on Sling as customers increasingly embrace it for sports, including college and pro football, and we remain dedicated to continuous improvement in reliability and streaming performance. We long ago learned how crucial performance is in live TV.","We continue to focus on delivering our uniquely-flexible relationship-based style experience regardless of what side of the pay wall a customer happens to be on in any given moment. We're offering great content, great experiences regardless of the subscriber status. And Sling users, including former subscribers and those we call occasionals, are welcoming the extra reasons to choose to engage with Sling.","Another reason to choose Sling will be the arrival of Discovery's content on the performance later this month. That content will come without any impact on price and Discovery has been an excellent partner for us. So, we think Sling customers will love having Discovery on the service. Now we're still finalizing our launch plans, so look forward to more news from us on that launch.","With that, many of you will recognize Paul Orban's name. As our Chief Accounting Officer, he's been with us for every customer we serve, both at Sling and DISH. With Steve's departure in August, Paul now serves as our Principal Financial Officer. Paul is going to make a few brief remarks on the quarter before we open up to Q&A.","Paul, take it away.","Paul W. Orban - DISH Network Corp.","Thank you, Erik. First off, I appreciate the opportunity to share with you the highlights of our third quarter performance. As someone who was here for the launch of DISH Network, I've seen us transform an industry before and I'm excited for the next part of our journey.","In reviewing some of the highlights for the third quarter, both operating income and EBITDA were up from the prior year. Operating income was $563 million, $114 million or 25% increase over the prior year. EBITDA was $743 million, a $62 million or 9% increase.","As we have done in prior quarters, it's important to note the positive impact of the new revenue recognition standard, which was implemented back on January 1. This had a $41 million positive impact to both operating income and EBITDA. The benefit from this new standard will decrease over time as the deferred cost began to build up.","With respect to operating revenue and expense, revenue was down 5.3%. This is largely due to a lower subscriber base and the decrease in Pay-TV ARPU. Our operating expenses decreased 9.6%, primarily due to a lower subscriber base, lower subscriber acquisition costs, operational efficiencies and decreased programming costs related to Univision.","As Erik mentioned, while the Univision situation is having a negative impact on our churn rate, it's having a positive impact on our subscriber-related expenses. The lower subscriber acquisition costs were partially helped by the adoption of the new revenue standard.","Continue to keep in mind, while we are building our wireless network, we capitalize nearly all of our interest expense. Also, our effective tax rate is lower in 2018 due to the Federal Tax Reform Act.","And looking at our metrics, Pay-TV ARPU is down due to a higher percentage of Sling subscribers in the Pay-TV subscriber base and a decrease in revenue related to pay-per-view boxing events. This decrease was partially offset by DISH TV programming price increases in February and increases in revenue per subscriber related to Sling TV.","The Sling increase was mainly driven by the mix of customers taking higher price packages and add-on revenue, such as ad sales and cloud DVRs. In addition, the impact of the $5 increase on our Orange package began this quarter and will be fully realized starting in the fourth quarter.","Our DISH TV churn rate increased due to Univision and our DISH TV SAC was lower largely due to lower advertising expense per activation. Free-cash-flow generation continues to be strong with $968 million in free cash flow during the first nine months.","With that, I'll turn it over for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We'll take our first question from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Charlie or Tom, can you talk about how you expect CapEx to ramp as far as the NB-IoT? Now, you have these things signed with Ericsson and I think SBAC also talked about you signing leases. Haven't really seen much in the CapEx line. How much does it go up in Q4? And how do we expect that to ramp throughout 2019?","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Hey, Walt. This is Tom. Yeah, you saw the Ericsson press release. We're bringing up towers now as we speak, and that will continue through the fourth quarter. It's more than just SBA. We have signed lease agreements, master lease agreements with all the major tower companies as well as a bunch of regional ones. We also have site acquisition and construction firms under contract throughout the country. So things are beginning to ramp. The CapEx guidance hasn't changed since what we've given previously, which is we expect the total wireless spend between now and the end of 2020 to be between $500 million and $1 billion.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Got it. So you don't \u2013 so as far as the cadence of that, it sounds like it's not really going to hit that hard in the fourth quarter. It's probably more of a 2019 event. I mean, are you actually going to be hanging antennas on towers in 2018?","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","We are. We're doing that right now. But to your point, I think the bulk of the activity will be in 2019, but we've got a pretty good backlog scheduled for the next 60 days.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Got it. And the maturity that's for next year on the debt, I think it's the 7 7\/8%, is the plan just to pay that with the cash that you will obviously have available on the balance sheet or are you looking to do some type of additional debt issuance to keep cash at a higher level?","Jason Kiser - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, Walt, this is Jason. Right now, the plan is to pay it off.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Got it.","Jason Kiser - DISH Network Corp.","Walt, are you on the line? Do you want to ask...","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","I am. And I just got a \u2013 I have a couple of quick follow ups. I just want to make sure, conceptually, based on the subscriber numbers that you talked about for Univision, it looks like you're probably losing at your average margin, you're losing $45 million a year of EBITDA from the subscribers that you lost, and you're picking up $150 million. Even if Univision only wanted $1 a month, and I'm sure they want more than $1 a month, you're picking up multiples of that in EBITDA. So it looks like a fantastic trade in terms of dropping Univision and only losing that many subscribers as a result. I just want to make sure I'm not doing anything wrong in the math there.","And then as the follow up, more of a conceptual question for Charlie. You're dropping Univision and it looks like it's never coming back, but yet you're taking a channel like Discovery and actually expanding its distribution to Sling. Maybe just walk us through, like what's the difference between a Univision? Is it that they're available direct to consumer and that there is no way to get something like Discovery without being part of a cable bundle? Just wondering how you're thinking about some of these broadcast channels versus some of the cable networks because I think people generally didn't think you would need a channel like Discovery longer term. And so just trying to understand how you think about the puts and takes of those negotiations going forward.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, this is Charlie. I'll try to \u2013 I'll start maybe conceptually. We would love to do business deals with anybody and everybody as long as those business deals make sense for us, and we try to make sure in any business deal that we also try to make sense for our partner because if business deals don't make sense for both parties, then there is frustration on one side or the other. So Discovery is a point where we were able to actually extend our contract and do a new contract with them before it was even up because we were able to sit down and work as teams that where we found new places we could work together that might be beneficial to both companies, might not. We might not be successful, but we're working together to try to improve the linear TV model as it is today and to expand on the streaming model. So it works when parties are engaged in that regard.","With Univision, a little bit of bad luck, and that this is not \u2013 in the sense that there's a management change in Univision at the time that our contract was up and there was probably \u2013 and the way we've always dealt with Univision is we're the leader in \u2013 we've always been the leader in Latino programming in this industry, so we've always been structured a little bit differently. It took a little bit of time for Univision management to really come to understand that and what the puts and takes were.","We had long voiced our frustration of their most valuable product of soccer being available on Facebook to our customers for free, even though we don't believe that was allowed per our contract. We \u2013 didn't make sense for us if they were selling the product for $7.99 to pay something materially north of that for our customers. We had real data on their ratings, and while they were saying they were the number one Hispanic channel, we knew that that wasn't true with our customers. We knew that the number one channel distribution was actually Netflix, right? And Telemundo had previously usurped and passed Univision in many of the day and night times.","And then so all those things, when you put all those things together, I think there was an unrealistic expectation. In fact, the previous management, it was kind of like, well, why do you want that number, it doesn't make any sense. And it was like, that's the number we need for budget purposes. So that's not a real strong argument. You might need it for budget purposes, but consumers won't pay that. So we have to fight for our customers. The customers expect us to fight for them. We expect that our customers are not telling us that they want more programming; they're telling us that they're not seeing the value in linear TV today. And it's up to our industry to try to make it more value.","So Univision, it's a good company, with good product. It's a valuable product, but \u2013 and if both sides knew what they knew today four months ago, that probably would have been an easier task. But and so now we're in a weird position where because we've given our customers discounts and many of our customers have gone to get Univision for free with an off-air antenna or perhaps from one of the streaming services online that's free, or perhaps from Univision directly, or perhaps from one of our competitors. We actually would face backlash if we put Univision back up again. So the problem is compounded. So that's \u2013 it's not that both management teams haven't tried to figure something out. They just haven't been successful at it.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","But it looks like a phenomenal financial trade for you at this point.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, it's not. In the short term, the answer to that is yes. The problem is that, and I think our challenge to Erik and his management team is to continue that. But what happens it's not that you \u2013 you continue to lose customers, all right, over a period of time. So it eventually tails out, right. And, obviously, the worst pain is the first four months. But secondly, for new customers, if you don't have the product, you get less new customers, right. So the challenge, which I think we can meet here, is so it's not quite as profitable as maybe you laid out, but it's certainly, at least initially, more profitable than doing a bad deal. The key is...","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","No. And the flip side of that is like you look at this, Discovery will help you get customers on Sling. So that's the other side of this.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, no, the real thing, the challenge for us is we believe we can actually increase our market share next year in Latino because we're going to be able to go out to customers and give them Univision. Just a simple example, but with an off-air antenna to give them Univision product without them having to pay for it, and our competitors are charging for that. So we're going to be more competitive with those people who are willing to get Univision another way. And even if that's directly from Univision, it will be cheaper than what we would have to charge them. So we actually become more competitive for in the bell curve the 40% of the people who are willing to get Univision with an off-air antenna for free. Right?","And so we actually will be stronger in that category as opposed to being strong against the whole category where we're all charging for it. So there's a different dynamic there. It's a long-term play. If you take it half a step backward by taking Univision down, we'll take a step forward in 2019.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thank you very much.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","So that's the gist of it. But it's maybe not quite as rosy as \u2013 I know you've given me a soft ball question there. It's not quite as rosy as you say.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks. One for Charlie. Can you talk about where you are in building an ecosystem of customers for the NB-IoT system? I know you need a certain number of customers in every market in a year and a half. And then for Erik, you said that Univision was about half of the losses. That helps a lot. How should we think about these losses coming in through the third quarter and then tailing in through the fourth? Thanks.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, so, Phil, that's correct. As I indicated up front, it's not a perfect science. But our best data tells us that Univision, that situation accounted for about half of our net subscriber loss that we had for the third quarter. Obviously, as that continues to increase in tenure, right, so we're in month four \u2013 actually, month five right now, the losses will continue to tail off. Although we will continue to have losses in the fourth quarter.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, and for us, it's how do you turn \u2013 how do you make lemonade out of lemons? And we believe we have plans to do that. We believe there is a \u2013 we know \u2013 we now have been able to track our customers that leave with Univision, and we've discovered a new market for ourselves that we previously \u2013 we prefer not to play in it. We prefer to keep everything in the ecosystem. We prefer that our customers pay for Univision. But to the extent that we can't they don't want to have a contract with us, we're going to find \u2013 we're going to be able to put an off-air antenna for our customers to get it for free. And we know that in the urban markets where most of our customer, Latino customers are, that is a very attractive alternative for our customers. And we've ramped that capability up and we'll continue to ramp that up.","As far as the IoT, we're building, basically, a neutral-host IoT network, a narrowband IoT network. We obviously have to get it built before we can get customers. So it's one thing to talk about what you're doing. It's another thing to actually show them and let people get on your network. So we don't have lots of customers to talk about today, and I don't think we'll have lots of customers to talk about until we get our network built. But it's something that we think \u2013 it will be a very functional narrowband IoT network that will work. We'll have lots of competition, and when we first announced it 20 months ago, there was nobody else that had announced narrowband IoT programs. But obviously today, the major carriers all have narrowband IoT programs in place, including T-Mobile on a nationwide basis. So we'll have a lot more competition than we anticipated. But we like competition, and we'll do the best we can.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Erik, if I can follow up, how should we think about the remaining base of customers split between urban homes, where you compete with cable, versus rural, where it's just satellite?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I mean on the DBS side and we've talked about this in the past as, I mean, obviously we have traditionally been focused on rural. That's where, obviously, the business grew from and our distribution grew. And on the DISH TV side, we continue to be focused on identifying profitable subscribers that can be with us long-term, and that points us to a less connected house and points us more towards a rural profile. And since our distribution is there, that's where the majority of our customers are coming from today.","And then on the Sling side, obviously it needs broadband to work. So obviously, from a Sling perspective, we're focused more on an urban customer, somebody who has high-speed broadband. And the nice thing about that is you don't see a lot of cannibalization, and it allows us to focus on, really, if we execute at the highest level, providing a Pay-TV service to 100% of the customers who want Pay-TV.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And so just, whereas our Latino \u2013 this is Charlie \u2013 but our Latino customers are mainly \u2013 are a paradox of that. They're mostly in urban areas, which allows an off-air antenna to work for them. Our normal DBS customers, that's not the case. They live mostly in rural. And obviously, most our local channels are delivered via satellite there as long as we can get a retransmission consent deal with somebody, which we historically have been able to get.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. A question on wireless and then one on Sling. So in terms of wireless, I think we get the $500 million to $1 billion build for Phase 1. When do we need to start worrying about the $10 million for Phase 2? Does that come right away, like in 2021?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","This is Charlie. Yes, it will come in 2020 and 2021 and 2022. And it will \u2013 we will certainly be a lot more open about how we're going to do that as we get farther along in that business plan. For us, we have to focus \u2013 fortunately or unfortunately, obviously, we're focused on the initial build-out because we have to get that done to get to Phase 2. And so we have the capital to do Phase 1. We don't have all the capital we need to do Phase 2. But that capital could come in many shapes and forms. And like anything else, when you have a really good business plan, you can find partnerships and\/or capital to make those things happen. If you don't have a good business plan, you can't do that. So when we launched DBS, we had a much bigger issue. We weren't proven \u2013 we had never done something of that magnitude and scale before.","But we had a good business plan, and we were able to find partnerships. For what would have normally cost us capital didn't cost us capital because people partnered with us and then we raised capital to use for things like a launch or something like that that we actually \u2013 or a satellite that we actually had to pay for. So, I think you'll probably see some kind of combinations like that.","But we've got to get the \u2013 look, the elephant in the room is obviously we have to get to \u2013 there's certainly skepticism in the marketplace that we somehow don't meet our \u2013 or don't qualify for the build-out schedule in Phase 1, and again we're confident that our narrowband IoT with our flexible \u2013 meets the terms of our licenses and we're working really hard to make sure we make the March deadline.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. And then my question on Sling, I don't think anyone is surprised by the sub numbers. I mean, they are lower than what we had seen. Is it more an issue of a gross add or a churn? And if people are churning off, do you know where they're going?","Warren Schlichting - DISH Network Corp.","So, hey, Marci. It's Warren. So, it's a good question. We continue to march forward with our focus on the customer experience. We do see folks that come and go. And so, I think as we've talked in the past, we're embracing that behavior with no contract and this easy low switching cost. We see a lot of people returning to Sling.","And so, where we're focused is how do we give folks just an awesome customer experience, so that this new behavior that we're seeing is rewarded when the customers actually come back to us. And that's \u2013 a lot of that has to do with just the way our \u2013 we've got this unique structure. But just \u2013 we like to think we're pretty good at video, and we've focused on the basics and folks seem to be coming back.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","This is Charlie. I mean, I think one of the phenomenons you're seeing is I don't think that OTT business is slowing down. I think it's probably accelerating. But you're seeing a lot more players in the marketplace than just DISH and Sony, now with DIRECTV NOW and now with YouTube and others and Hulu.","You're seeing major players that are all gaining subscribers, and everybody has a little different offering, a little bit different slew of channels, a little bit different interface.","Obviously, Disney has talked about going direct to the consumer. So, you're going to see an awful lot of people in the category, and at some point there will be too many, and at some point there will be a consolidation.","But so, it's probably more that the category is growing, and the competition is just tougher, and most people probably aren't making money in the business today based on their programming cost. And so, at some point, somebody is going to get profitable and kind of lead the pack. And so \u2013 and we think that Sling we can be \u2013 we think we have a lot of advantages and some really, really technology, and we think we can be a long-term player there.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wolfe Research LLC","Are you profitable now, Charlie, in Sling?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","It depends on how you look at it. But under Charlie Ergen's definition of profitability, I think I'd like to make a little bit more money than we're making today.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Charlie, you've spoken a couple of times about partnerships for your wireless plan and you've mentioned this in the past as well. And some of the cable companies are starting to talk about potentially using third-party spectrum to reduce their MVNO cost. If you could just share your thoughts on what kind of partners you're looking at and whether some of the opportunities on the cable side might look interesting in the future. So that's the first one. And secondly, on the virtual MVPD side, is there an opportunity for Sling to essentially sell itself on a wholesale basis instead of a retail basis? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I would contend that we already sell Sling on a wholesale basis to the consumer given the low cost and their cost of programming there, but let's talk with the partnership kind of question. So, the broad answer is we don't talk about individual conversations we're having with people, but we will say that we certainly have a lot of interest in what we're doing.","The thing that's different about what we're doing is we're building a 5G network with a completely clean sheet of paper from the ground floor up without the legacy of the incumbent networks, which were built \u2013 which have 2G and 3G and were built for voice. And we're transforming to \u2013 and this isn't 5G marketing, this is real 5G. And what I mean by that is we're transforming what's happening \u2013 instead of building a network primarily for voice, we're building a network primarily for digitizing the physical world. And I'll give you just a simple example of that because this will blow your brains out if you try to really totally understand it. But Uber is a good example of transforming digitization to the physical world. When you pull your phone out and push the Uber button, five miles away a car starts turning immediately towards you, right? So you transform something in the physical world.","The future is going to be that not only are you going to \u2013 not only is that car going to move towards you, there's not going to be a driver, right? And so there is no network today in the United States that can do that at the level that you need to do it. They don't have the latency, they don't have the throughput and so forth and so on.","So anybody that's in \u2013 so the kind of people that are interested in what we're doing in terms of \u2013 and by the way, China is doing the same thing. So if we want to lead in 5G, I will guarantee you you're going to have to have a stand-alone network because that's the only way you're going to compete with other people in the world who are doing stand-alone networks.","So car companies are going to be real interested in what we do. People like Uber are going to be very interested in what we do. If you're in robotics and manufacturing and you have to synchronize all your sensors and now your robotics are on cables and you want to make those things wireless so that the robots can move, you're going to like what we're doing. If you're in health care and you want to operate on somebody in a rural part of the country with a trained surgeon, you're going to be able to do that with our network, right? So if you want to do virtual reality and you want to have a headset on that's wireless with tons of capacity, you're going to like what we do in our network.","So you not only have to have really efficient use of spectrum in terms of how you architect your network, you also have to virtualize your network. And by that I just mean you're taking a lot of hardware that's in the marketplace today and you're going to turn it into software which is going to lower your OpEx, CapEx but it's going to make your network more flexible so that you can change your network at a moment's notice.","And so cable companies, to your point, would they want to start \u2013 would cable companies want to start with the old technology or do they want to move to the new so that they can leapfrog what the incumbents do? If I was the CEO of a cable company, I'd want to leapfrog, right?","So because our network is fundamentally a neutral host, it means that any of the people we talked about could be part of our network. Think of us as wireless AWS, right? With AWS you can just add more capacity to AWS. You get to use your own data. It's secure and it scales and it's a very \u2013 think about that in a wireless space. That starts to make some sense to an awful lot of people that are looking at it. So not the analyst and not the \u2013 maybe even the FCC hasn't caught up with what we're trying to do because maybe we haven't articulated it well yet. But we're going to be a big factor in where this country goes and we're really pleased to see the executive order where 5G is a national priority. We will be part of that, and if it's a national priority, you have to have a ground floor up network because the legacy is \u2013 it just eliminates a lot of the things you can do in 5G.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Can I just follow up? I mean, I think in the filing with the FCC objecting to the T-Mobile-Sprint deal, I think there was a suggestion, if I'm not wrong, of potentially partnering with T-Mobile and Sprint or somehow participating in that network. Is that a way to accelerate some of your build-out? Is that something that you would consider?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I think our objections to T-Mobile-Sprint are just really fundamental on a competitive nature that consumer prices are going to go and there's too much concentration in the network. Maybe on point to your question, in other countries where four has gone to three, as part of those deals, the two incumbents going to three had to \u2013 part of their conditions were to facilitate a fourth provider. And that could have been in build-out or spectrum or MVNO deals or things like that.","So I think there is some historical precedent in other countries for that kind of thing, but I don't know that that was material part of our opposition.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Jayant with Evercore.","James Ratcliffe - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. It's James Ratcliffe for Vijay. Two if I could. First of all, in the Q, you mentioned there's a new long-term incentive plan with 4.5 million options or so that vest based on performance metrics. Can you talk about what those are and what metrics you're using to judge the performance of the business and if any are related to wireless? And secondly, on the HBO front, I know you mentioned earlier that the key issue here is the minimum subscriber level. Did the prior deal have a level? And if so, what is it about the new proposal that isn't acceptable? Is it that it's higher or the term? Any more color would be helpful. Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I'll take the second part of your question, and Erik will probably take the first part of the question. On HBO, the key point is that they would require us to have a minimum number of customers that we pay on. The problem with that is that that wouldn't be maybe unusual in an environment 20 years ago, but the environment today is you could \u2013 if you run the math on that, you could be in a situation where your competition, AT&T DIRECTV, which owns HBO now, right, and they're already doing this, they're giving HBO away free for life. So why would a customer pay DISH when they can get it from DIRECTV free for life, right, or from AT&T free for life.","So, therefore, you're paying on customers that you don't have, and they're giving it away for free but they're still getting paid on customers, right. So that would be \u2013 there's no \u2013 that would be malpractice. There's no company that would sign up to a deal like that. And then additionally, HBO sells direct to consumers, right? And you don't know what price they're going to have, I mean, what they're going to sell it at, and unless you contractual guarantees and things like that, that, of course, we haven't been offered. So it makes sense if you're AT&T, what they're doing makes sense, right. In other words, they will lose some money from DISH in terms of the subscribers who are paying on, but they will get subscribers from DISH, particularly in rural America, because they're the only other alternative for the customer.","So this is purely an anticompetitive play that we tried to warn about. They said they weren't going to do it at trial. They said they were never going to take HBO to \u2013 it had never been done before. We've always been able to reach agreement with HBO. First time in 40 years. The only difference is AT&T and DIRECTV now own it. You guys are smart guys. You guys are analysts. You guys can figure it out. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what's going on here. But we can't sign a deal that we would lose, that we would actually pay for their customers. That doesn't \u2013 then that's what it would be. So that's the gist of that. And, Erik, you want to take the incentive?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, sure. So I think one of the things that we pride ourselves at DISH about, and we have for quite some time, is that we take a long-term approach to the business. And so we have long-term incentives as management from time to time. The incentives should really help us focus on things that cannot only impact the business today, but help prepare us for the future. And generally speaking, I mean, we're focused, obviously, on growing customer relationships and our capabilities. Definitely improving the customer experience. Having a good balance between acquiring profitable customers and having cash on the balance sheet. And then really focused on fielding the best team we can. So our incentives generally are focused in on those four areas.","James Ratcliffe - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just a quick follow up on the HBO question. It does appear as a blackout. Can you give us any color into maybe what fundamental impacts we could see in the fourth quarter, and whether it's churn or financial? And then a second question on spectrum. Can you give us an update on the conversations between SNR and Northstar with the FCC regarding their status as designated entities? And then if we just assume that your argument prevails and the R&D as designated entities, what would you expect happens then? Do you anticipate that the spectrum would be returned? Or are there other things in play at that point in time? Thanks.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, I'll take the second part of that first. I guess it's one of the frustrating things in terms of the DE structure with the two DEs. Obviously, according to the courts who are the third-party arbitrator, that we didn't qualify as a DE, but we weren't given the chance to cure. And we still \u2013 and so now, we've been given a chance to cure, but it wasn't the normal chance. Usually, we'd go in and talk about things and I've always found when you talk about things you probably can come to more common ground about it than if you're just filing paper. But we're in a situation where the process, at least so far, has just been to file paper.","So, that's been complete. I think in late October, all those filings were in. So, the FCC has all the information they need now to make a decision. And at the core of it is the discounts of about $2.5 billion on the spectrum. And there's other side issues with the return spectrum and penalties and other things, but the core issue is this build-out, there were 30 \u2013 I think, there were 36 things that the FCC found lacking in our application, so we took that seriously.","And we said if that's the case, we're going to make it right. And with the DEs, we've gone in and changed all 36 things. And I think people that have objectively spent time and read those filings and looked at it, I think objectively most of the things I've read I think 100% of them have come to conclusion that we have in fact cured. But, obviously, FCC is the one that needs to make that decision.","So, it would be helpful. It would be helpful to get a decision, whatever that decision might be, so that we have certainty and we can move on with some of our planning, because we would love to have more meaningful conversations about how we can utilize that spectrum. And most of the time today has been spent on \u2013 management time on our side has been kind of in litigation, which is not productive.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just to be clear, it is fair to say that if you have a favorable outcome, what you ultimately would want is you'd want to have those licenses return to the affiliates?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, I mean, I think, obviously, to the extent \u2013 look. I think to the extent that \u2013 I mean, I believe this was probably in the papers that were filed, so nothing nonpublic here. But I think to the extent that had the DEs been given the opportunity to cure as every other DE has throughout history, that there never would have been a return to spectrum. There wouldn't have been a need to return spectrum. They would have been able to figure out a way to qualify as DEs and there wouldn't have been a return to spectrum.","And so, the policy has been that you go back to the point \u2013 that when that happens, you go back to the point in time as to when you had the dispute which would be that they weren't allowed to have a conversation.","They still haven't been allowed to have a conversation. It's all been through paper. So that's a bit unusual. I mean, it feels like we're in the dog house, right. And, again, I think that we'd like to be out of the dog house, and we'd like to do whatever it takes to get out of the dog house, but that's kind of where it is.","And then, on HBO, I forget the question now.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Any financial impact or fundamental impacts so far.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Oh, well, yes. Yeah, so \u2013 it's essential programming and we'll lose customers. But we \u2013 given what contraction they wanted us to do, we won't \u2013 it will be interesting to see if we lose money or not because how much money we lose because we'll lose customers. But the actual cost of HBO we won't take a loss on that as we might have under the contract, but we'll lose customers that, obviously, and particularly rural America we know those customers. The only alternative for them is to go to DIRECTV. So, it will have a negative impact. We just don't know how much yet, but it will be a negative impact for sure.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Hodulik with UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Maybe for Charlie, just a quick follow up to that question. It looks like you're seeking arbitration under the rules AT&T agreed to as part of the Time Warner deal. What does that process look like? And what's the timing of it? And does HBO come back up during it? And then maybe a second one for Warren. Anything you can tell us about the cadence of the sub growth on Sling? Some reports that you may have reestablished some momentum towards the end of the quarter. And do you expect to continue to grow that business even through this sort of aggressively-competitive phase? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, on the HBO arbitration, unfortunately, in the trial that AT&T did not ever consent to HBO arbitration. So, obviously, you can see why, because they're able to use it as a weapon against people like DISH. That's why you could take what they say and you can take what I say and you can take all of it with a grain of salt. The way to cure the issue is to go through \u2013 is we will go through arbitration. We voluntarily would go to arbitration. It would look like baseball arbitration, which means that they would issue a contract, they can include a guarantee and everything that they want to have in it. We would say here is what we will pay. And an arbitrator has to pick one of those two contracts, right?","And then you have to live with that contract. And that would be the fair way to handle this particular dispute. Consumers are not harmed at all, and whoever has the best economic argument wins the day. And that's the way it should be. And so they're not required to go to arbitration because they want a trial.","Turner Broadcasting does have to go through arbitration but not HBO. So you can see why AT&T would have the position that they have because they can use it as an economic weapon, and they can gain market share. Just like they \u2013 look, they gained market share with Univision. I mean, they got some of our customers in the third quarter for Univision, so. But I will say, some people say we've been in a lot of disputes.","First of all, we've done a lot of deals without being in disputes. And we've done massively more, and two other people are going to be in disputes because people just, when the financial guy started looking at deals, when they started realizing that the more customers they get the more they lose or in some cases if you do lose customers you lose more, even more money. It's not going to be business as usual, and you're going to see a lot of disputes in this industry. And we probably have fewer than most people when people really start looking at the math. Because linear TV is going to be challenged and the model's changing and our industry is not doing enough to keep up with it and working together enough to stave off the other new entrants.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","And then just on the cadence of the sub growth, the cadence is more or less the Pay-TV cadence and just think, at least in these early days \u2013 and it is very early in this business \u2013 the volatility is higher, so you see larger swings. Then with respect to growing, we absolutely expect to continue to grow, even in the face of competition. Our bet is, obviously, that rationality returns at some stage. I think we've seen a little bit more fiscal conservatism from DIRECTV NOW; probably a couple more that could afford to get financial religion there. So, yes, we expect to continue to grow, and we think we're in this for the long haul. And we're hopeful that rationality returns to some of our competitors.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks. Charlie, a question for you on the FCC request for information on the specifics of the IoT network, are you expecting a response from them from that and if so, in what sort of timeframe? And if they don't respond in a reasonable timeframe, is that tacit approval that the network plans that you've submitted meet the requirements under the rules, under the build-out rules?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I'd say a couple of things. One is we filed our plans 20 months ago. So we're past the point of no return. We've ordered all the equipment and entered into leases and we're down the road with our network. So there's not an opportunity for us to change it today. We're happy to have whatever dialogue with the FCC and the staff in terms of what our plans are. And we probably should do more of that so that they understand what it is to do. But the terms of our build-out were set four or five years ago with our license. And it's the license that \u2013 you just have to read the license. Again, you've got read \u2013 but it's a license that has what's called flexible use, which means you basically have to have a service. And, look, we'd love to have a more robust service with full broadband but with only 5 megahertz of uplink spectrum, that is not a practical thing you can do.","So rather than \u2013 again, this is another tough concept for you guys. But when we build a network that's 10 times more efficient than the current networks, that means we're going to use spectrum more efficiently. That means we're \u2013 that's the opposite of hoarding. That's using spectrum more efficiently. When you're virtualized, you can use your network 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at a much better capacity than current. That's less hoarding.","The fact that we went to more downlink than uplink, we all know on this call that consumers \u2013 that people use more downlink spectrum than uplink spectrum, but most people's networks are synchronous, they're same amount of uplink as downlink. So, that means people are hoarding uplink spectrum.","We took a long-term view of it and said let's do more downlink spectrum because that will be a more efficient use and so forth. We know that, as an example, T-Mobile, if they're successful with their acquisition of Sprint, has said they're going to decommission Sprint, which means that spectrum is not going to be used while they're decommissioned, which means they'll be hoarding spectrum.","So, we've never missed a final build-out deadline, and we're not going to miss this one, and we have competitors who would love to have our spectrum. We know that people in this business know the power of a standalone 5G network and that obviously competitors would prefer to see that that doesn't happen. And one of the ways you do that is you try to pass laws, you try to attack, and you try to use regulation to stop that, right?","And so, don't be sidetracked by that. We're going to stay focused on making sure we meet the terms of our license. And as we sit here several years from now, we'll be talking about why our network is different than everybody else.","And, look, we're hopefully going to make the FCC proud. We're going to make the Administration proud and the Congress proud of what we're going to do. We did it with direct satellite, where the paradigm shift was analog to digital, right? And people were just as skeptical back then of us at the point in time. I will say that the FCC was very skeptical of us, but they were a bit more of a cheerleader than the FCC is today. So, we wish we had a little bit more cheerleading going on. But if we have to be our own cheerleaders, we'll be our own cheerleaders.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks, Charlie.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Okay. Operator, I think we have time for one more from the analysts.","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now take our final question from the analyst community. Our final analyst question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. So one of the cable companies during their earnings season made an oblique reference to low-band spectrum that's available, not being used within their footprint this quarter without mentioning DISH by name. And I think you mentioned cable, I think, for the first time on this call. Would you consider that one of the options in your panoply of options to operationalize your spectrum, to essentially partner with your erstwhile enemy, the cable firms?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, specifically on low-band spectrum, it's not cleared on a nationwide basis today. So, much of our 600 \u2013 our low-band spectrum, of course, is in big cities, and it's not cleared. And it's not \u2013 statutorily, it doesn't have to be cleared until I think the summer of 2020. So, I'm not really in a position to \u2013 nor would anybody \u2013 nor would they be able to build that.","T-Mobile has been able to build out some segments of theirs, but they built that out in a 4G way. And since we want to build out on a national basis and we don't have a customer base, it makes more sense to wait for the 5G spec and for that spectrum to be cleared. So, that doesn't mean that we don't \u2013 look, if you look at the list of people that are interested in what we're doing, is cable as a gross generalization interested? Yes, they are.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","We will now take questions from members of the media. Our first question comes from Scott Moritz with Bloomberg.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg LP","Hey, guys. Can you hear me?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg LP","Great. Charlie, maybe you can speak to the OTT industry at this stage. It seems you guys are 3.5 years in. Growth kind of took off for a while, but now it seems to be sputtering, not just for you guys, but for others. You see customers coming in and out on their contracts or lack of contracts, but you also see a lot of people still going to Netflix. Is OTT \u2013 has it reached a post-peak in terms of growth trajectory or is it something that will be around in a niche form for the time being? How do you see this playing out?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, it depends on how we as an industry back it. I don't think it's sputtered as much as many people are writing, because I think that \u2013 I don't know that everybody releases their numbers. So, there may be some growth that we're not seeing with some of the other players. But OTT has a lot of potential, but you've got to give customers what they want, and so we've got a couple of problems.","One is, as an example, it's much more prone to piracy. So, a lot of the programmers think they put it on and they don't realize that once they get there that a lot of people under the age of 40 know how to pirate stuff and never paid for TV in their life, and they've made it really pretty easy for them to do it. And so, it can be as simple as sharing passwords, but there are certainly other ways to do it that people can do it, and we're one of the few companies that actually has a full-time staff to attack piracy.","People don't like commercials, and they like bench viewing, but yet no OTT provider is really able to do that in an efficient manner today, because contractually we're not really allowed to. So, you end up with a product that people continue to watch less of the traditional linear programming including broadcasting. Those numbers continue to go down and things like Netflix and things continue to go up. So, there has to be a fundamental shift on the thinking of the linear programmers, and I'm hopeful that that process has started and some people are thinking about it a different way.","Certainly, Disney is thinking about it a different way, and I think their product will look probably different than their linear product. And, hopefully, some other people will try that as well. If not, then, yeah, it will sputter out and not be a huge impact. But if done correctly, OTT will be a big factor. It will be as big a factor as cable or satellite have been to the business. It just has to \u2013 we have to go through some evolutionary changes to do it. And our philosophy has been to the extent that content owners want to work to try to achieve some of those things, we're willing to work with them.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg LP","Great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Dano with FierceWireless.","Mike Dano - FierceMarkets, Inc.","Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I appreciate it. And I just wanted to ask about the timeline for the Phase 2 build-out considering that there's a so-called race to 5G with China and other operators are moving ahead with their 5G build-outs. What is the sort of timeline that DISH would give in terms of building out a standalone 5G network?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Well, thanks, Mike, for the question. Everything kind of comes together for us in 2020. Our spectrum \u2013 our low-band spectrum will be cleared and hopefully the DE situation will be cleared up one way or the other by then. We will obviously have built out our first network in nationwide on the narrowband IoT network.","And the 5G spec, the 5G spec Release 16, which allows you to really do what unleashes the power of 5G with ultra-broadband, ultra-connectivity and ultra-low latency. Those three things combined with the software and virtualization all come together in 2020. And so, that's when we'll \u2013 that's when you'll start seeing DISH 5G. I don't know how long it will take to build the entire nation out yet, but obviously the more that we can plan between now and then, the faster we'll be able to get that done, so...","And then, you'll see \u2013 I think you'll see kind of legacy networks that will do some of the things we can do. They won't do all the things that we can do, and they'll be a little bit \u2013 they'll efficient in certain things and not efficient in other things. And their primary focus is going to be consumers, and our primary focus is going to be digitizing the physical space. That's a big concept and it's maybe hard for you to understand, but you'll hear more and more about what I just said. You'll hear a lot of people talking about that, because that has way bigger impacts than the phone in your pocket.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sheila Dang with Reuters.","Sheila Dang - Thomson Reuters Corp.","Hi. Thanks for taking our question. You mentioned with the Univision situation that there were ways that you can still go after Hispanic viewers, such as providing antennas. And while HBO is dark, I was wondering if there's anything similar that you can do to stem losses from that HBO blackout.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, not really. Some of our customers that have broadband connections may be able to go directly to HBO, but that's a different situation. You can't put an antenna up and provide HBO. So that's why it's so anticompetitive, because AT&T knows full well that for many of our customers the only place they can go is to DIRECTV, and they own HBO and they own DIRECTV.

I know that there continues to be a lot of interest in our spectrum plans, so Charlie and Tom Cullen are also here to take your questions on wireless a little later.","Today, I'm going to focus the majority of my remarks on our core pay-TV and broadband businesses. As you all know, we rolled out our all new Hopper with Sling product in January with great fanfare. This second-generation Hopper, winner of the 2013 CES Best of Show award, and more recently recognized with PC Magazine's 5 Star rating and Editor's Choice award, was engineered with today's customer in mind, with such consumer friendly and DISH-exclusive features as PrimeTime Anytime, AutoHop, a 2 terabyte hard drive for storing up to 2,000 hours of storage, a remote control finder, SiriusXM commercial-free music and DISH Anywhere, Hopper Transfers and DISH Explorer. It is DISH's goal to provide the consumer with the best possible video experience. And with the Hopper with Sling, he or she can upgrade their viewing experience in the home [ph], not at home [ph] at their time [ph]. At [ph] last count, Hopper has received 17 national awards. Hopper is simply the best as voted by the consumer electronics' industry pundits. Other companies simply cannot [ph] understand that no other provider can match the experience that is now available for our Hopper experience [ph]. Apple clearly believes that the combination of the Hopper with Sling and the iPad creates a superior customer experience. And as you all know, Apple chooses its partners very carefully and extends its brand name only to the best of the best in its marketing efforts. In May, we launched an exciting promotion with the Apple iPad. When qualifying DISH customers purchase a Hopper with Sling, they have the option of receiving an Apple iPad instead of traditional programming discounts. It is without a question the ultimate consumer bundle.","The Hopper gives customers the ability to transform their tablets into second TVs. These features, communicated through targeted marketing and our innovative bundled product promotion, have resonated with our high-value customers. In fact, the success of the Hopper with Sling has been confirmed by the increased Hopper attachment rate in the quarter, which drove higher SAC investment. So in some ways, we're a victim of our own success. But we'll make that bet every single time in order to attract high-value customers that generate better ARPU and NPV. And also as a by-product, we're also seeing a higher referral rate from our Hopper subscribers. Now Robert will give you all the additional SAC details in a few minutes. But thinking long term, we believe Hopper subscribers, especially those with tablets, are the right high-value customer targets for DISH.","Now as you all know, certain broadcasters will not run our Hopper television commercials, given our position of standing with the American consumer in regards to their right to skip commercials. Obviously, we've already won this battle in the court of public opinion. We've now also won in the court of law. Three weeks ago, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the California federal court's denial of FOX's motion for a preliminary injunction against DISH's AutoHop and PrimeTime Anytime features. So the battle over consumers' rights for choice and control wages on. Stay tuned, as they say in the TV broadcasting business.","So we refocused our marketing efforts on cable TV, print, billboards, radio, online and social media. Also, to further expand our Hopper message of a superior consumer experience, we partnered with another American iconic brand that epitomizes excellent customer service: Southwest Airlines. Southwest also provides us with a direct traveler linkage to our Hopper with Sling product. Again, these are ideal high-value potential consumers: affluent, frequent travelers and a great likelihood to own a mobile device. Now when you fly Southwest, DISH will provide WiFi-enabled video service absolutely free. Normally, it's a $5 charge. The Southwest customer will view our national TV spots featuring the iPad offer and instructions on how he or she can purchase DISH's Hopper. They also receive Southwest's frequent flyer points when they sign up for DISH. Our DISH message appears on the flyer's confirmation document, boarding pass and monthly frequent flier statement. We also have high brand visibility in airports and in Southwest's own in-flight magazine. And of course, the energetic Southwest flight attendants deliver the DISH offer announcement on the plane. The promotion started July 1.","Now in addition to the Hopper, our dishNET launch continues to be a success. Quick recap, in October of last year, we introduced a new broadband satellite service, which makes faster speeds, greater capacity and lower cost available to a market of more than 15 million unserved or underserved American homes. In the second quarter, we continued to experience solid broadband satellite growth. And because most of our broadband satellite customers are bundled with pay-TV, DISH's strategy to leverage its operational scale is succeeding.","Now let's move on to the second quarter numbers. We faced fierce competitive pricing pressures, aggressive promotions, a weak economy and new video providers in the second quarter. Of course, this is traditionally a soft sales period for the industry. In pay-TV, we lost 78,000 customers, which was partially offset by adding 61,000 dishNET broadband subscribers. We stayed the course of growing our base of high-value customers, and we continued to increase the percentage of customer activations with HD, DVR and IP connections. And given our first quarter price increase, our first hike in 2 years, we were pleased with our churn results at 1.67%.","Now to provide you all with additional details on our financial performance, here's our CFO, Robert Olson.","Robert E. Olson","Thank you, Joe. Clearly, there were a number of onetime items impacting the second quarter, the largest of which was the $438 million impairment charge we took on 2 of our AWS-4 satellites, T2 and D1. Based on the FCC's recently issued rules on our AWS-4 authorizations and our analysis this quarter of likely potential commercial uses, we concluded that these satellites represented excess capacity. We evaluated potential market values for selling these satellites or components of these satellites, and as a result, have written down the net book value. While we have no requirement to use a satellite component, we are currently planning to use our remaining AWS-4 satellite, T1, in the commercialization of our spectrum. If you pull out these impairment charges, our second quarter operating income was roughly flat year-over-year.","As Joe noted, subscriber growth is typically challenging in the second quarter for most pay-TV providers, and we were no exception. Our pay-TV business was down 78,000 subscribers, which was weaker than last year, but better than second quarter 2011. The shortfall was largely driven by weaker gross activations as our churn of 1.67%, up 7 basis points year-over-year, was about where we expected given the impact of the price increase this year.","Our broadband business continues to experience solid growth. Gross activations of 79,000 in the quarter were significantly higher than the 21,000 activations we achieved in second quarter last year and roughly on par with the 83,000 activations we recorded in first quarter. We ended the quarter with 310,000 broadband subscribers.","Subscriber-related revenue was up $161 million or 4.9% in the second quarter compared to last year. This growth was largely driven by pay-TV ARPU, which is up $3.31 or 4.3% year-over-year. We saw the entire benefit of our price increase in this quarter, but this impact was partially offset by weaker pay-per-view revenue year-over-year. We expect pay-per-view revenue to rebound to more normal levels in the third quarter. In addition to the pay-TV ARPU growth, subscriber-related revenue was up $25 million due to year-over-year growth in our broadband business.","Subscriber-related expenses increased by 5.5% in the second quarter versus last year. This increase was largely due to higher programming expense. The year-over-year increase was less than recent trend, largely driven by the lower pay-per-view activity. Our SAC for the quarter was $882, which was flat with first quarter, but up $82 year-over-year. Increased brand advertising associated with the launch of the Hopper with Sling accounted for $12 of the increase. Increased capital expenditures drove $49 of the increase, the majority of which was due to higher offer take rate. Our Hopper take rate was up sequentially and year-over-year. Of course, increasing our Hopper take rate is a positive, as we will have more of our customers with the best technology in the industry. Also, as the Hopper mix in our base gradually increases, ARPU will also gradually increase given the price differential versus our older HD technology.","Our Blockbuster business had an operating loss of $5 million in the quarter. Second and third quarter typically have weaker results due to lower product sales revenue. We ended the second quarter with approximately 450 domestic stores. We are currently planning to close roughly 100 underperforming stores by the end of October.","Administrative expenses were down $51 million year-over-year in the second quarter. This reduction was a result of fewer Blockbuster domestic stores and the de-consolidation of the Blockbuster U.K. business. The reduction in Blockbuster expense was partially offset by $18 million of legal and financial advisory fees in the quarter related to the proposed Sprint merger.","While depreciation expenses were relatively flat year-over-year, we incurred elevated depreciation both this year and second quarter last year. The accelerated depreciation this year was associated with $53 million of certain ground facilities supporting the TerreStar MSS business. This business had less than 2,000 customers, and we decided to cease operations in the second quarter.","Interest income was up $24 million year-over-year, driven by the higher balances of cash and marketable securities. Interest expense is up $106 million year-over-year, largely due to the issuance of new debt during 2012 and 2013. We incurred $30 million of onetime interest expense in the quarter due to premiums, interest and financing cost associated with the $2.6 billion in debt we raised and then redeemed within the quarter tied specifically to the Sprint deal. Other income increased year-over-year, largely due to the $76 million of unrealized gains on the Sprint derivatives which we marked to market. We generated $263 million of free cash flow in the quarter and $638 million through the first 6 months despite the increase in Hopper demand.","There were a few major changes in the balance sheet compared to first quarter. We issued $2.3 billion of debt on April 5. That debt, coupled with the cash flow we generated in the quarter, helped to drive up cash by $1.2 billion and marketable securities by $1.3 billion.","Let me now turn it back to Joe before we start Q&A.","Joseph P. Clayton","Thanks, Robert. Our plan, our direction remains the same: to grow high-value customers and to increase revenue, while making the strategic investments for our future. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. Now we are going to open it up to your alls questions. We'll start with questions from the financial analysts. And when we're finished with those, we'll open the line up for questions from the media.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, Charlie and Tom, if we can start out on the LightSquared effort, can you talk about how that would fit into the existing spectrum that you have? And then second, for Charlie, does the excess cash on the balance sheet create any urgency for you to do something in addition to LightSquared? Or is that sort of -- you look at that as a cost of your optionality?","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. Second part, obviously, we have a lot of cash and we're just -- we're not going to do something just to do something. So we have some negative arbitrage there, but it's good to be in that position, and it does -- so I think that if there's opportunities out there, we'll take advantage of them. And as far as LightSquared, it's kind of a unique property with a lot of problems. They've been well documented over the years. The reason, we think, it's interesting to us is because the spectrum potentially could fit with the existing spectrum that we have in long term. And realize that the LightSquared is very similar to what DBSD and TerreStar were like in the sense they were essentially satellite companies' MSS spectrum, but the real value was terrestrial so. And all of them kind of failed as satellite operators only. So putting all that spectrum together, at the same time maintaining the ability to use the satellite for voice and data makes a lot of sense. And so we're -- because of our history as a satellite company, we understand that part of it a little bit better, and we think that fits together pretty well with what we're doing. So that's why we're interested in that. It's obviously a long-term play. It's obviously something that has a lot of hoops to jump through in terms of from a regulatory point of view and in terms of a technical point of view on the spectrum. So it's challenged, and if you could take a long view with that particular spectrum in my opinion.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Kraft from Evercore.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Charlie, I just want to ask you -- I mean, since you've abandoned the Sprint pursuit, how do you view the attractiveness of the mobile wireless business today, given the increasing competitive intensity? How would you compare now the attractiveness of network sharing versus acquiring an operator? And if you think about the inherent attractiveness of Sprint versus T-Mobile, how would you contrast those 2 potential opportunities?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I don't think anything has really changed. I think that obviously, in the pursuit of Sprint and Clearwire, obviously, we learned a lot, and we continue to learn more about the industry. We certainly learned a lot about those 2 companies. So strategically, we still think everything that we really talked about in the last few months, in the last few years is still -- this is important today as it was then, which is, how do you kind of put communications inside the home and outside? How do you put those together into one national company? And wireless is a big part of that. So we're still very bullish on the wireless side of the business. It is becoming a more cost-competitive industry. Certainly, I think the recent transactions of Leap to AT&T and SoftBank's success with Sprint and Clearwire will make both those companies more formidable in terms of going forward and so forth. Obviously, when you put networks together, to the extent that you can do that with an existing operator, or do that in a network sharing way, that's probably a preferred way to do it. And so I think there's going to be some opportunities for us when we look at that, and we're just going to make good rational decisions. And again, I think you can make good rational decisions when you have full knowledge. And we spent the last 5 years gaining an awful lot of knowledge, and I think that ultimately that will pay us dividends as we decide strategically how we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up to one of the earlier questions. You have about $9.5 billion of cash and securities on hand, I think another $500 million-plus coming in the third quarter post the sale of Sprint derivatives. So at what point would you consider buying in some of your float maybe via a share buyback? That's the first question. And then the second question is the latest retrans fight between CBS and Time Warner Cable seems to highlight a change in the definition of television or pay-TV to now include digital. So do you agree with the statement? And then secondly, if you do, do you think the change to the definition of pay-TV is material enough whereby it could help ease the regulatory environment should DISH and DTV look at some opportunity to merge?","Charles W. Ergen","I'll take the first part of that. It's Charlie. Nothing's really changed. We look at our cash balance and look at share buybacks, and that's an option. And obviously, the options are to first and foremost is manage, and we hope we can go out there and invest that capital in other businesses and grow our business and do something strategically that would ultimately return a greater value to our shareholders over time. Having said that, that's not always possible in the marketplace and share buybacks certainly can be considered. I think we have a plan that's been approved by our board to do that to some degree. And obviously, we could look at dividends. Now obviously, we looked at dividends when the tax rates were changed. And that's less attractive to us today. But I think -- I guess the way I'd sum it up is, first and foremost, we'd still think the strategic things we can do with our capital. That's where we prefer to do it. But absent that, we would consider share buybacks and less likely to do dividends based on tax implications of that today. Tom, did you want to take the...","Thomas A. Cullen","Well, Marci, on the definitional, clearly, the lines are blurring between traditional delivery methods and digital. But in this particular dispute, and I think you saw some chatter about this yesterday, the fact that a DISH subscriber could also be a Time Warner Cable broadband subscriber bothers us that our customers would be brought into the fray on a dispute between Time Warner and CBS.","Charles W. Ergen","And then I guess the last part of the regulatory process. Certainly the marketplace is materially different than last time we tried to merge with DIRECTV in the sense that you've got -- in fact the 2 growing -- the 2 actual growing people in the pay-TV business are phone companies. They didn't really exist in the business last time we tried it. And then of course, you have almost an unlimited number of people now on digital Internet getting into the business, whether it be from Netflix to Hulu to Amazon to everything else that you can do on the Internet. And that's only going to grow. So clearly, it's a different environment from a regulatory point of view. One doesn't always know the way the regulators think. But my experiences with the regulators has been, they understand the market pretty darn well. And they see the same things that we see. So I think it's a different environment today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","One for Charlie and one for Joe. I'll ask Joe first. You've highlighted the Hopper a few quarters now, as this pure product and SAC costs are higher, as high as they've ever been. Now why is that not translating into flatter growing gross additions year-over-year if you have a better product to sell in market? And as part of that, how should we think about the iPad promotion versus return on investment levels for new subscribers? And then, then I'll have one for Charlie.","Joseph P. Clayton","All right. I'll try to take that. Robert, you'll help me with the iPad investment piece. Yes, we've lost some subscribers, but that does not mean we haven't sold a better mix of product. We're replacing some low-end subscribers, customers with better higher-value Hopper customers, if you will. Now we will get some relief in terms of the SAC from a product cost basis as we ramp up the volume with the Hopper with Sling product. And that will start kicking in really late this quarter, but more appropriately [ph] in the fourth quarter. As you ramp up your volume, you get economies of scale and the product cost will come down. That's just the basic function of consumer electronics.","Robert E. Olson","Doug, this is Robert. I think we've made it fairly clear that in order to qualify for the iPad promotion, the customer needs to have a higher credit score. And so we start off with customers that are taking this product being better customers to start with. An additional part of the economic equation is that we expect referrals from customers who have Hopper with Sling and have the iPad. It's a great product. They'll be taking it with them everywhere they go. So when we look at the economics, we think of them pretty positively.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then Charlie, I was just hoping to get you to expand a little bit more on your wireless commentary. So let me try it this way. I think you've noted in the past, the wireless sector is likely to consolidate down to 3 or 4 operators. And there's an investor perception that the only wireless partner that you really have left that makes sense to work with is T-Mobile. And I know you just mentioned network sharing with others as an option. But can you comment at all about the viability of competing with these larger wireless operators without being a part of one?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. I mean, I think you -- I mean, I think -- I don't think you can compete if you just did the same thing they were doing. That's why I think video is such a big part of what potentially can be done from a wireless perspective. And I think where we would have an advantage and why we would be a very good partner for one of the wireless providers in the sense that we can give them something that differentiates. One of the things that always struck us as difficult on the Sprint acquisition for SoftBank was, at the end of the day, it was still going to be Sprint. And we -- and they didn't bring any spectrum. They didn't bring anything that was different. What they do bring, obviously, is capital and tremendous expertise and creativity. And so I assume that they will find ways to compete very well. But they don't really -- they're not going to compete on geography, and so they're going to have to compete on price. And so I think there's still a lot of opportunity for us. And I think that opportunity -- certainly, T-Mobile from a -- this is a company, you could put that together with DISH in any number of ways, including an acquisition or a merger, and that's probably not possible with the other wireless providers. But having said that, I think the other wireless providers do provide us some pretty good options. And I think in an ironic sort of way, Sprint becomes a really kind of an interesting potential partner for us as well, and I think people just assume maybe that, that's not the case. But the fact is, we actually understand Sprint and Clearwire probably better than we do any of the other wireless providers. Certainly, I think Sprint and Clearwire understand us pretty well and certainly understand that -- certainly understood the synergy and the strategic reason why we are an attractive option. I think we were just too late to the party. We got hung up in regulatory and there just wasn't an opportunity to convince the special committee that they could wait another 6 months to a year to take a chance on us when they had essentially somebody at the table who was willing to step up and pay today. So I think that there's a lot of optionality for us in the wireless business. I don't think that has changed any. Unless you just look at a full-blown acquisition or a merger and really, that's probably only T-Mobile at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Charlie, just sticking down the Seinfeld strategy route of line of questioning. I was wondering, given all the time you've spent in D.C. over the last several years, a couple of things they have to decide over the next few years. One is on the incentive auctions and the other is on spectrum caps. I'm wondering if you have a view on how either of those shake out and particularly how the spectrum cap might impact AT&T, who a lot of people think is a natural buyer of your spectrum. And then on the incentive auctions, whether you'd be interested in acquiring any of that spectrum since you've generally been a buyer over the last several years on the spectrum side? And I guess I'll leave it there.","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I don't know where the -- obviously, we have a new FCC Chairman coming on board this fall. So I think he'll take a fresh look at spectrum caps. And generally, the Democratic side has been more in favor of competition and new entrants. Typically on the Republican side, it's been a bit more laissez-faire, let the marketplace decide it. So I assume that the new commissioner will be -- will still continue some of the policies of the past. But I do think that all wireless providers will be able to get more spectrum, and as more spectrum becomes available, that they will be able to increase the spectrum that they have so. And that's going to come in obviously in the form of auctions and so forth. We participate in most auctions. We'll continue to participate in auctions. We don't see anything -- the H-Block unfortunately is not as attractive to us if it's auctioned by itself today, as things stand today. Because it doesn't really provide -- it's really -- doesn't provide us much because it would be uplink spectrum for us that -- we need more downlink spectrum so, but it doesn't mean we wouldn't participate. I mean, obviously, we want to make sure a fair price is paid in the marketplace so. And you never know what people are going to pay, so it always makes sense to show up. So I would expect that we would show up in most auctions, although the H-Block is not particularly attractive as things stand today. The incentive auctions for the broadcaster spectrum of course has a lot of hoops that the commission and the broadcasters will have to jump through to make that available. If it's made available, and we've made a lot of comments on the public notice, and it comes in a form and format that's generally along the lines that we've suggested, and we generally agree with where the FCC is on that, that I think you would see us participating in that.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on your comment before about DIRECTV, DISH and now things are different today than 10-plus years ago, how would wireless -- your wireless vision be impacted by a combination? Would the combined cash flow and sort of borrowing capacity, firepower of the 2 companies mean you wouldn't even need network sharing? You could enter the market on your own? Or is it still something that you think that you need to partner if you were -- even if you were a bigger business?","Charles W. Ergen","It's an interesting question. I think there's a couple of things. One is that, I think I heard Mike White's comments, John Malone's comments, I think you have a general kind of momentum, gravity towards consolidation, in part because the programming partners have gotten so powerful that their rates are going up at 4x or 5x the rate of inflation. And we got into this -- we got into the video business because cable companies as monopolies were raising their rates 3x the rate of inflation year after year after year. The government worked with -- to open up new competition. We were able to enter the marketplace. We've got almost that going on, plus even a little bit more in my opinion, where the programmers themselves are really in a way monopolies. There's 5 big programming groups. They're essentially monopolies. They're raising their rates at double-digit rates, inflation's 1% or 2%. And so I think that just -- and really, Congress really hasn't done anything to level the playing field. So you see it in retransmission disputes, you see it in other disputes. So I think that, that forces people towards consolidation to kind of level the playing field. So I think that from a regulatory point of view, that's more achievable today than it ever has been because it's just too one sided today and the consumer's losing out on that. And then of course, secondarily, there's new competition coming, whether it be from the phone companies themselves or from the Internet that didn't exist before. So I think the marketplace is probably fairly attractive for consolidation of the video business. It might happen in cable first, and that may force the satellite guys to look at different things. And then I think the other thing that's interesting is -- having said that is, our strategy has been a little bit different than DIRECTV's in the sense that we thought that wireless or outside the home is part of what we would like to do and what would make us successful and transform us. They may not necessary be in agreement with that. And so you might not ever be able to put the companies together because you just have a different strategy and -- or it's possible we don't have the right strategy, that we have to look -- we're not married to any particular strategy if events change. And it's possible that if we couldn't be successful in the wireless business that we would just sell our spectrum. And so then our strategy would be aligned with maybe where DIRECTV is today. So if we couldn't convince DIRECTV that wireless made sense, and they convinced us that -- or the marketplace or the regulators, we just couldn't get in the wireless business. And as I said many times, we're not suicidal about it. We'd exit the wireless business and sell our spectrum and then we'd be a video play. So all those options are available for us. I like where we are strategically. I think we still have the same optionality that we've had for the past year with the exception of possibly Sprint Clearwire being maybe a different kind of option for us than it was before. And my experience has been that, there's going to be events that trans -- fold that are going to force us in a certain direction that makes sense for our shareholders. And we will continue to look at whatever we do strategically to be the right long-term decision for our shareholders and for our employees.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Jayant from International Strategy.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Charlie, one piece, the LightSquared transaction, I'm just trying to get some clarification. Is that you personally buying the spectrum and then eventually selling it to DISH in some undulant agreement? And then for Robert, obviously, the broadband business is the growth aspect of the company right now. Can you go sort of give us some more clarity? You mentioned it's got similar economics to pay-TV. But any color on what the ARPU, SAC and gross margins are on that business for you? Really appreciate it.","Charles W. Ergen","Robert, you want to start that?","Robert E. Olson","Yes, I'll start with the broadband. I think we perhaps talked about this before. But we think long term, the broadband business will have similar subscriber acquisition economics, so the net present value of acquiring a subscriber as the pay-TV business. We're not there yet. We've still got a lot of work to do to improve our customer service, our operations, real blocking and tackling work. But we're moving forward, pretty much every quarter we're getting a little bit better. Churn is a big thing that we're working in the broadband business. It's not quite down to the pay-TV level, but we expect it will be. I think we've mentioned before that generally SAC is a little bit lower in broadband and ARPU is a little bit lower right now on broadband. So SAC in the $600 range and ARPU in the $60 range.","Charles W. Ergen","And the nice thing about -- it's Charlie -- in broadband, the content cost is down, like 0 so, and stays down. So that's the attractive part of the broadband side. As it relates to LightSquared, I mean, obviously, this is all public information. But I did -- my understanding was that there really wasn't a corporate opportunity for DISH, but I did buy debt personally in July. The court has indicated that they will take the exclusivity period for the company management to make bids in bankruptcy is gone, so that any company can make a bid in bankruptcy. DISH and the special committee and independent Board Of Directors and the Board of Directors decided that they wanted to make a bid in bankruptcy of about $2.2 billion. And so that's the path that DISH is pursuing. So ultimately, how that shakes out -- and they got the support of basically the ad hoc committee of lenders to support the DISH bid. The judge has kind of rejected that in the sense that they want DISH to come in with the management of LightSquared. Certainly, DISH will work with LightSquared management to see if they can come to a conclusion on preparing something with management support. I'd say the timing is an issue there. And at some point, DISH might not be interested from a timing perspective with LightSquared. I think it's an asset that has had so many difficulties that it's one that there becomes a point in time when maybe it's not as attractive to where DISH wants to go. So I'm in an awkward position obviously, so a lot of the stuff is done external to me. But right now, strategically, it seems to be the right thing -- a good fit for where DISH wants to go. So we'll see how it plays out. But bankruptcy is difficult and judges make a lot of decisions. And there's lots of people that have a stake in a bankruptcy, and you can't always herd everybody to the same conclusion. So it's not a must-have for DISH. It's certainly something that seems attractive to DISH versus other potential investments, but it's certainly not a must-have. It's not certainly something that -- as you know, we would be disciplined in our approach, and we'll remain disciplined with LightSquared.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had one more question on the LightSquared stalking horse bid. It seems like there's a fair degree of uncertainty on a couple of different dimensions, how much spectrum -- whoever buys the asset ultimately gets. What the Inmarsat payment is. And so in the context of your $2.2 billion bid, would you just mind taking a second and just in broad brush strokes, laying out sort of the bull case and bear case in terms of what you would hope to achieve if you ultimately succeed in buying that asset?","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. I don't know if I can do that, that well, but I think there's different elements. Certainly, there is -- there would be with LightSquared, at a minimum, uplink and downlink to satellite spectrum. It would have some value in the sense of an existing business of machine-to-machine or handsets to a satellite. That's irrespective of probably the kind of conflict they've had with the GPS industry and Inmarsat per se. The second thing is, there is a -- the second piece of it, they do own some spectrum outright. I think it's 18 megahertz of spectrum outright. Some of it's conflicted, that has some kind of value. Certainly long term, you would work with the GPS industry to try to clear some of that spectrum. And some of that takes a long time to do. And then thirdly, there's the potential lease of additional spectrum from Inmarsat and Inmarsat clearing that spectrum and the payments that go to Inmarsat to clear that spectrum. And so you look at -- you kind of look at the value of LightSquared and say, \"What are the odds that you're going to get any -- that some of those pieces are going to come to fruition and some of them aren't?\" And that's kind of how we looked at it, and that's kind of how we came up with $2.2 billion as kind of a price between the satellite assets and the spectrum assets, assuming that perhaps Inmarsat is not something that continues the way people or the way LightSquared thought was -- initially entered in a contract. And also looking at some of the -- and also making the calculation that some of the spectrum will be impaired for a considerable period of time. So again, as a result of that, it's not quite as cut and dry as some of the other things we've done when you look at the thing. I think there's a lot more -- there's a lot more betting on the come on LightSquared than perhaps some of the things that we've done before. And you have to -- but having said that, we know the government wants to free up more spectrum. We know that we're in a spectrum shortage. We know the government wants to see spectrum put to use. But I think this administration has generally been -- and this FCC has generally been supportive of entrepreneurship and creativity. And our feeling is that, that there's a desire on the government's part to free up the spectrum. And all the hoops that the government's jumping through to free up spectrum for auction, there does exist spectrum in LightSquared that can be freed up with the desire for people to compromise and look at technical solutions. And we think we're a perfect company to go out and do that kind of thing because we have a long-term view of it. So that's how we look at it. The bear case would be that you just have some satellites and some long-term spectrum. And the bull case would be that you -- the real bull case would be you'd free up 40 megahertz of spectrum. I'm not that bullish, but that would be the bull case.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tom Seitz from Jefferies.","Thomas O. Seitz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Charlie, no one disputes that wireless data traffic is growing through the roof. But what I think has some people surprised is how much of the traffic growth is shifting to WiFi, certainly, in the home, but increasingly out of the home as well. So two questions, if I could. Do the business models you contemplated when making the spectrum investments anticipate that phenomenon? Do you think it even matters? And then second, do you worry at all that when Washington starts to dig in on this, that there's the risk that they begin to allocate materially more spectrum to unlicensed uses, potentially devaluing to an extent purchases of spectrum? I guess I noticed at the June Senate hearing on the state of the wireless industry that the only service company called to testify was Comcast. There wasn't even a mobile operator at the table.","Charles W. Ergen","You bring up good points. I think those are interesting things that had to be considered. Certainly, WiFi is an opportunity and also a threat. It's an opportunity in the sense that if we were building out a network, there's a lot of areas where we wouldn't have to build out, right? Because WiFi would exist, so as long as you can combine with WiFi, it makes the buildout a lot less and you just have to cover some outside geographic areas. On the other hand, WiFi takes customers away from your network and puts some on some public spectrum. There has been some -- and there is some more spectrum coming online that's going to be available for WiFi. So WiFi is going to become an improved product with 802.n and the additional spectrum there that you're going to get. But they still have the long-term fundamental problem that it's unlicensed spectrum, so you can't have a consistency of service. And consumers are going to want a consistency of service. You're going to want to know when you're using our wireless device that it's got -- it's going to maintain a pretty consistent speed no matter where you are, and you're not going to really -- and so I find myself -- and I see a lot of people -- when I'm in a LTE area or a 4G area, I'm actually turning WiFi off and getting a better experience in LTE. I think that's where you want to get to as a wireless operator, where you want your customers to know that the best service they're going to get is not going to be on WiFi, it's going to be on your network. Then the challenge is to get the cost of your network down, so where your cost of your data is low enough such that people will accept that consistency to -- will pay for that consistency. Now that was part of the attractiveness of Sprint for us, which was, they had -- Sprint -- Sprint Clearwire has the kind of capacity to do what I just said. They have the ability to go out and create a network that will be fast enough consistently that at least where they have coverage, where they have geographic coverage, you're going to prefer that network to the WiFi. So we'll have to wait and see kind of how it develops. On the other hand, there's probably going to be people who never build a network at all and just have devices that work on WiFi and never build a network, and some customers are going to be happy with that experience. And that experience probably is going to get a little better than it is today. So they don't have any CapEx, and they'll just have a network off the public network. So we'll have to see how it all goes about. I think the government's going to look at it -- because I think auctions are such a big part of where the government is going, that you're probably not going to see a lot more public spectrum coming online because then there's nobody to pay for it. So at least for the foreseeable future, the new spectrum coming online appears to be private spectrum that will be auctioned.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","So with regard to your upcoming negotiations, can you remind us what made your negotiations -- I know you have a few coming this year on the retransmission side. And given all the noise, the backdrop of the retransmission environment, all of the dispute, and also given the traction that you're getting with your Hopper, Charlie, do you feel like your approach to the negotiations is dramatically -- would be dramatically different today than it was, say, in a couple of years ago? So clearly, you're still in litigation with Hopper even though it's very obvious that it's been very well received both from a technical and consumer standpoint. So I'm just kind of trying to tie it together in the context of your retransmission deals that are still ahead, how your philosophy has evolved.","Charles W. Ergen","I'll take a stab in just a little bit of it. Maybe Joe or Robert want to chime in there. But as far as -- I don't think the Hopper has a material effect on retransmission consent. The train's left the station. Customers skip commercials. We kind of maybe we shined a light on it a little brighter than other people have done it. But people skip commercials. Advertisers know people skip commercials. TV as we know it is going to change. And I think where we have tried to move the industry is to go to commercials that are meaningful to customers. And so we think those are more valuable to the customer. We think they're more valuable to the broadcaster. So a part of what the Hopper does is give you the ability to target a commercial and play different commercials for different customers. We think those are more valuable, and we think people are going to skip those less. But the train has left the station for the consumer to have the right to skip a commercial. I think that's going to -- I don't think that's going to go away. And I think there might have been a lot of hype about -- from the broadcasters' perspective when the Hopper first came out. But I don't think that, that's material in any retransmission consent talks at this point in time. And then you guys may want to...","Robert E. Olson","So Tuna, this is Robert. We have retrans negotiations going on all the time. So they're going on today, they'll go on tomorrow. With regard to major programming networks, national networks, we usually don't disclose the specifics of that.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Okay. Do you get a sense of a lot of pushback? Or I mean, let me rephrase the question. Are you at risk perhaps of a major signal disruption of the type that we saw a couple of years ago? Or do you feel that you have enough kind of a fallback position to be able to continue to operate? And I'm talking about the broadcast networks, not necessarily the cable networks.","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. I don't think there's probably a major risk to -- I mean, from a broadcast network perspective, I don't think there's a major risk -- a real major risk. I mean, the broadcasters themselves don't own that many stations anymore, right? So you're pretty fragmented in terms of -- it's good news, bad news. You've always got retrans negotiations going on. I think we have somebody down today, right?","Robert E. Olson","Raycom.","Charles W. Ergen","Raycom's down today. So they're in a lot of smaller communities, but if we add them all up, it's still -- it adds up to maybe half the size of a major broadcast network. So that's an ongoing thing for everybody. Obviously, I think -- I don't know if CBS is still off Time Warner, it is, so that's -- we end up from a positive point of view for us short term. Raycom's a negative for us short term. That will have to all kind of come out in the wash. I think the overriding thing is that obviously, that broadcasters as an industry have gotten more aggressive in terms of retrans discussions. And there's going to be more outages, which is ultimately going to lead to 1 of 2 things, it's going -- 1 of 3 things: It's going to lead to industry consolidation, or it's going to lead to Congressional action, or it's going into new technology alternatives. Whether it be to guys like Aereo who do it a different way or whether it be that people just quit watching broadcast networks, right? I will guarantee you that there'll be customers on Time Warner Cable when they come back -- whenever CBS comes back on Time Warner, they won't watch CBS as much. They'll watch some other shows because they'll realize they don't miss it or they've discovered new programming that they didn't know existed before. Or they went to the Internet and cut the cord and never came back. So all those things are going to happen. It's nothing new to us, right? It doesn't surprise us, right? And content owners are going to go where they get paid. And so they've got a product. It's got a limited shelf life. They're going to go do all the -- ask where they think they maximize their revenue. And I think what's going to happen is there's going to be mistakes made from content owners' perspective in the sense that the linear programming as we know today with a big package that averages over $1,000 a year to the content owners, as they start putting that out in different forms and it becomes more convenient for customers to go on the Internet and get it, their actual revenue has a risk of actually going down because obviously, the linear providers and the bigger packages will go down. So that's -- and how that all shakes out, it's going to be very, very interesting and some people are going to navigate that -- some companies will navigate that better than others and thread the needle a little bit better. But I think all the content revenue in the industry is probably at risk for a variety of reasons too long to go into, and for a variety of reasons where I don't think the industry quite understands how the Internet works and how consumers use it. And so you just end up with decisions that will be interesting. And hopefully, at end of the day, the consumer wins. Because if the consumer wins, we're going to try to be on that side.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","That's very helpful. Just a quick clarification for Robert on interest and taxes. It seemed like a lot of onetime items in this quarter. So if you can help us kind of recap on the -- what would be a good run rate going forward for modeling purposes?","Robert E. Olson","Sure, Tuna. I think in our 10-Q, we disclosed that we had roughly $30 million of onetime interest expense related to debt specifically raised and then redeemed within the quarter specific to the Sprint deal. So that should not continue into future quarters. With regard to taxes, we had the favorable benefit of a settlement with the IRS with regards to years prior to 2009. That was roughly $15 million of favorable impact that was onetime in nature.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Okay. So what's your ETR now? Is it pretty much stable, as it were, going forward?","Robert E. Olson","It -- we've said before that it's in the 37% to 38% rate. And if you make the corrections I spoke to, you'd get there roughly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Devon Xu from Wells Fargo.","Devon Xu","I just had -- was a little bit more curious on when you think the -- just fill or kill on moving into a wireless space is given coming out of the auction, fringe [ph] deployment and some of the FCC terms on your spectrum.","Charles W. Ergen","I'm not sure I understood the question. Tom, did you get that?","Thomas A. Cullen","No. I'm sorry. Would repeat it?","Devon Xu","Yes, so when do you think the deadline is for making a decision on how you approach the wireless space, if you'd do it at all?","Thomas A. Cullen","Yes, this is Tom. We're mindful of course of the buildout requirements that came with the AWS-4 spectrum. But keep in mind, there's 2 different intervals there: One is 3.5 years out and the second is 5.5 years out. I think, given the pace of change in the industry over the last 12 months, the concentration of spectrum will probably continue well before those deadlines. What we're doing in the meantime, and as Charlie mentioned, there's a new Chairman coming into the FCC and some other changes there that we'll see develop over the next couple of months. But in the meantime, we continue to work with the vendor community in the infrastructure development around AWS-4 radios, which is shrinking one of the key intervals associated with any deployment of that spectrum. As mentioned earlier, the question came up around spectrum caps but -- and I don't know how the commission is going to deal with that eventually. But the reality is, there's been a wave of consolidation in the industry this year with Sprint and Clearwire, with Metro and T-Mo, with Leap and AT&T. So the number of holders of spectrum has naturally shrunk. And yet, the needs of 315 million Americans and growing is not going to shrink. It's going to continue to expand as they bring on multiple devices. And a younger generation, there's 70 million people in this country under 15 years old. That generation is the one that's going to be more voraciously consuming videos. So however the commission deals with it in time, the needs of the American consumers aren't going away.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Hargreaves from Pacific Crest Securities.","Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just actually sort of a follow-up on that. Do you have any sense for how close to -- I don't know, their spectrum caps the wireless guys are at peak usage right now? I mean, how desperate are they for more?","Thomas A. Cullen","Well, I think it's dependent on the individual holder and the number of customers that they have. So can't you can't look at just across the board, somebody has 105 megahertz versus somebody who has 75, because one might have twice as many customers using it, first of all. Secondly, the -- in terms of the strict definition of caps, as you know, there's a growing view that different frequencies should be viewed differently in the eyes of the commission relative to spectrum depth. But again, those are the types of things that will be determined through rule-making and process, but I think, generally, there's a sense of urgency that those questions have to be answered definitively. And I'm sure that will be one of the agenda items for the new Chairman.","Charles W. Ergen","And this Charlie. There's one more variable you've got to look at, which is, you can't just turn off your spectrum -- and everybody wants to go to LTE because it's 300%, 400%, 500% more efficient than 3G or whatever the number is, right, or whatever the number you want to use so. But you can't just turn off your 2G and 3G and snap your fingers and have LTE or 4G. So that's why new spectrum is so important, because you can take new spectrum and, of course, deploy it as 4G or LTE. And then wean your customer base over a period -- a number of years, which may be 10 years or more and continue to -- with your 2G and 3G. So it's a little bit -- there's one more variable that all the carriers have to go through in terms of how they deploy and how they can modernize their network. So that's obviously Sprint in their network vision, that's a difficult thing -- they were so much spectrum limited for them to deploy LTE is very difficult, which is why Clearwire was so important to them, because that was virgin spectrum for them to be able to convert to LTE. So lots of variables that you've got to consider beyond just the spectrum cap.","Andy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you just explain a little bit more about why the video you consider to be a strategic advantage as you look to get into wireless? Because it seems like on one hand, you're saying like a video is kind of -- the profit opportunity is declining, and that as we move to the next generation, the core competencies of running a network and video programming seem more likely to diverge than anything.","Charles W. Ergen","Again, I don't know that the video opportunity -- profit opportunity is declining in video. I think it is a very mature business as we do it today at DISH, which is a linear package of hundreds of channels that customers pay on average over $1,000 a year. That's a mature business, right? And the profit opportunities there are more limited. Having said that there is tremendous opportunity for our content partners and for DISH to do video outside the home on a wireless basis, right? So what people would refer to as TV Everywhere that there's great profit opportunity for content owners and us in that particular situation, particularly as you get into more targeted advertising and things you can do. So that's why a lot of the technology we work on all kind of comes together in that form. To do it outside the home, the only way I can think of to do it is in a wireless manner, you certainly can't haul a cable around while you're driving a car down the road. So at least not that I know of. So if you do that in a wireless methodology, then you've got to have spectrum to do it. Second thing is, that video consumes a lot of spectrum. So if you look at all the 0s and 1s and bits you're using, the vast majority of them are going to be video. I think the majority of bits today are video. It's probably going to be 80% or 90% of your bits in future are going to be video bits. So that would be a tremendous advantage for somebody who understood video and had relationships with content owners and technically knew how to make those content owners get more money and be more profitable. That all works, right? And that's why we think that's the differentiating item.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Moffett from Moffett Research.","Craig Moffett - Moffett Research, LLC","I wonder if I could return to Tuna's question from a short time ago. You have a Disney renewal coming up in September. Can you talk about what your objectives are in renegotiating the Disney contract? And how smoothly do you think that negotiation will go?","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. I think, obviously, Disney's been a good partner for us for a long period of time. And obviously, our motivation would be to get a fair price, to be treated fairly as the third-largest video provider and our customers to be treated fairly and to get increase. And I think Disney's perspective is increase the amount of money we pay them. So there's the way to thread the needle there. There's rights that we don't have today that we'd like to have. Those are valuable to us. They'd like to charge us more money for them. And in both sides -- neither side has to have the other side, right? We're not -- Disney's not going to go out of business without the DISH Network and vice versa. There's a -- if you take a really long-term view of it, because the sports are so expensive, if you take a really long-term view of it, and because there's so many different -- because most of the linear providers today are doing exactly the same thing, for example ESPN is exactly the same on DISH as is DIRECTV or on Comcast, if you take a really long-term view of it, somebody sometime may decide that sports isn't something they have to have. And therefore, they can have a materially lower price for customers. And while they'll lose customers initially, they will gain customers long term, they'll be back in a growth pattern for gaining customers. So there could be a day when strategically, companies just can't get together, where they go opposite directions and they both have strategies that work for them, and we're prepared to go either way. I mean, I think that's where you have to get yourself in position. So obviously, we'll work first and foremost to find a deal with Disney that makes sense for our customers. If we get that deal, we'll do it. If we don't get that deal, we'll part ways. Simple as that. So I'm optimistic that we will get a deal done with Disney. We've had lots of discussions about it already. But you never know till you sign the final agreement. Joe, I don't know if you want to add something to that? Because you've been more involved than I have.","Joseph P. Clayton","We are engaged. I was in New York last week. They were here this week. We're moving, I think, to a favorable solution for both parties. That's the objective.","Operator","Next question comes from Jason Armstrong from Goldman Sachs.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just 2 quick ones on rate hikes\/ARPU. I guess it sounds like the second quarter had a tough compare as it related to some of the events. But going forward, should we expect the video ARPU left to be closer to the $5 rate hike that you put in, so sort of an acceleration as we move into 3Q and 4Q? And then maybe looking at 2014 sort of along the same lines, you're probably far enough into this to know whether large rate hikes every 2 years is a better strategy than smaller rate hikes every year. I'm just wondering, as you think about the forward, which strategy makes more sense based on what you have observed [ph] so far?","Robert E. Olson","Jason, this is Robert. With regard to your first question, we will have probably less headwind in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter. As I mentioned on my opening remarks, we had some pay-per-view headwind year-over-year that should go away. With regard to your question of whether we'll hit the $5 price increase, we'll get closer. That $5 price increase was not applied to every customer. We had talked about this before. Customers that had joined us within the last 12 months did not see that price increase until their 12-month anniversary. Also some of our international packages were raised by different amounts. So it will be closer, but it won't be the $5. With regard to your second question on the once-a-year pricing versus every-2-year pricing...","Bernard L. Han","I think -- this is Bernie. I think 2012 was really an anomaly. I think our path had been to do a price increase every year, for a number of reasons, largely a big billing conversion that we did in 2012, we skipped that year. And I think as we've alluded to in past discussions on this call, that's probably something we'd lean against doing again.","Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So another rate increase the beginning of 2014 and get back to sort of an annual schedule, would be the concept?","Bernard L. Han","That's correct.","Operator","Your final question will come from Walter Piecyk from BTIG.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Just want to go back to your comments on using the satellite. If you are able to get LightSquared and use their satellite, does that reduce the need to use the satellites you have from your existing spectrum? And then also on the H-Block, you had mentioned, I guess there was a filing last week from your meeting at the commission talking about not wanting to bid on it. Are there specific reasons or are there things that the SEC could do that would increase your interest in bidding in that spectrum?","Charles W. Ergen","It's Charlie. I think, I mean, obviously, we kind of fought and lost for some of the things that we think the SEC could have done to make that spectrum more valuable to us. Doesn't mean we can't revisit some of those things with them, but I don't think we wouldn't bid on H-Block. I mean, I think it's less interesting to us than had they done some of the things that we put in our filings before. It's probably more interesting to Sprint. It's probably really only interesting -- I mean, if you look at it from a big picture perspective, the way H-Block is configured today and based on the rules, Sprint pretty much got the rules that they wanted for H-Block. So I think it's very, very interesting to Sprint. And they're probably the one that's most likely to prevail there. About -- with the first part of the question -- oh, the LightSquared, I think that satellites are an important part of what you would do from a communications link and from handsets, I think an important part. I think we wrote -- we realized that we have today a very good asset in T1 in terms of the ability to cover the spectrum that we have in S-band today, that's why we wrote down the other satellites, because they're not really needed to do that. LightSquared obviously has some satellite assets that do something similar, although we don't really know those satellites very well at this point. And whether you -- and how you -- but we do think that you could use those satellites in conjunction with the existing satellite assets that we have and do some interesting things.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Could you get rid of the existing ones, Charlie, and just use the LightSquared ones? Meaning, if you wanted to do something else with the spectrum, would you need both?","Charles W. Ergen","Technically, I would say you probably -- technically, you probably -- depending on what you're doing, you wouldn't necessarily have to have both technically. From a regulatory point of view, that's a different question. And number two, you might come up with ways to do more things, in which case, you might need more satellite assets, so -- but if you just kind of did the world as we see it today, you wouldn't need all the satellite assets, which is again, why we wrote down 2 of the satellites this quarter.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And Rich Greenfield wanted to hop on with a follow-up question. He is going to take my second question.","Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","Charlie, I was just curious. You've spent a lot of time before talking about doing something over-the-top. Intel's been discussing a launch sometime before the end of the year with a non-facilities-based MVPD-like service. Wondering where you stand on that? What's your appetite for doing something like that, whether with sports or without sports?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, I mean, we certainly talk to all our major content providers about over-the-top services, just as probably everybody has. And we haven't found a lot of support for that kind of service. And it's not necessarily our first choice of things that we want to see happen. Obviously, over-the-top is -- would be available probably to multiple people, probably will be over time available to multiple people, and that's going to bring some challenges to our current existing model. So we certainly understand over-the-top. We certainly are technically prepared for over-the-top if that becomes something that content owners want to do. But it's not something where we are trying to be the leading advocate to go change the world to over-the-top. I think Intel -- I think people who are in the business today are more inclined to do that, such as Intel. To the extent that they are successful, I would hope that our content providers would give us the same rights and we'll go compete. But we haven't seen a great critical mass of content owners willing to do that at this point.","Thomas A. Cullen","Okay. That concludes our Q&A with the financial analysts. And we thank you all for joining us today. Now we've got a little more time for members of the media to ask questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Sherman from Bloomberg.","Alex Sherman","Charlie, I have a few questions for you. The first one is, you mentioned doing a partnership with Sprint again. And you also mentioned potentially doing an acquisition with T-Mobile, sort of being the only one left. And I'm wondering if you can just explain a little bit about, what makes more sense for DISH? Or maybe which one of these options is more likely? Just any sort of detail that you can give on, why you might do one instead of the other would be helpful.","Charles W. Ergen","I don't have preconceived notions about it. I would say a couple things. One is obviously T-Mo is a company who, if you want to go into the wireless business, they come kind of ready-made to go do that, right? And their network upgrade is much, much simpler than Sprint's. And so if you want to enter the marketplace, you'd be in fourth position. You have to look at that and see whether you strategically can get there. T-Mobile has got a lot of momentum now because of Leap's inability to do things. And with Sprint being tied up in the merger, their inability to kind of move forward. That's all going to change, right? So what does T-Mobile look like when Leap is now AT&T and Sprint is now -- and Clearwire are now under SoftBank's management. That may be a tougher challenge and may not -- it may be a challenge that we wouldn't feel comfortable taking on. On the Sprint side and Clearwire side, we just know those companies really well. We know their networks really well, realizing we went through full due diligence on them. So we know we fit pretty well with where they might want to go. And I don't really know the SoftBank executives at this point, but they seem very innovative and they seem very creative, and they certainly seem to be more aggressive maybe than some of the other people in the wireless business. So I think there's a lot of similarities between the way we think and perhaps the way they think. We certainly gained a lot of respect for them. They bought -- they basically won an asset that we'd like to have. We gave it our best shot to get it. And sometimes, your best isn't good enough, but their best was better than ours. I like those kind of people. I like people that are better than us. I want to hire people that are better than us, and I like to work with people that are better than us. So that's why I say indirectly, that might be an interesting fit for where we want to go. It's not our only option -- yes?","Alex Sherman","The second one I had for you. I just want to give you a chance to sort of defend yourself here. Because I know Harbinger is basically accusing you of fraud by skirting the rules a little bit by buying their debt yourself and then potentially combining it with DISH. And I wanted to give you a chance to just sort of respond to that accusation.","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I think that all I can tell you is that I personally followed all the rules. I think DISH has followed all the rules. We'll respond in the appropriate way, and we will certainly put -- I will certainly personally put my track record and what I've done. And I will put the flash -- I will put the light on that. I'll put the light on DISH, and we'll put the light on Harbinger and Mr. Falcone. And we'll let the courts and the public opinion decide who is fraudulent and who is not.","Operator","The next question comes from Liana Baker from Reuters.","Liana Baker","Charlie, you suggested in your comments that a network partner would be preferable and that T-Mobile would be your only option for M&A on the wireless side. Should we read from that, that you've given up on M&A, or had talks with T-Mobile that didn't go well? I'm also wondering if you have a deadline that you set on yourself on your wireless strategy.","Charles W. Ergen","We don't have a deadline. I mean, I think that you -- there may be events that put an obstacle that we just can't overcome. And that is more likely what happened from a regulatory point of view, from a government point of view than it would be from the marketplace. But we don't have any deadline, and we're going to continue to -- we continue to see that as a potential strategy. I disagree with all the other comments you made before that, right? I don't -- we still think our options are all open. We're not discouraged by what's happened in the wireless business. That it hadn't really been anything totally unexpected there. We got dealt a bad hand with regulatory delay. But life doesn't always go in straight lines and it doesn't always go exactly the way you want it. And sometimes, you have obstacles. And what separates companies and people are those people that overcome those obstacles. And so we'll try to continue to overcome those obstacles, unless the obstacles are so great we can't [ph] think we can, or we come to conclusion that we can't. And we haven't come to that conclusion yet.","Liana Baker","Is there any indication that T-Mobile would be interested in working with you, or any color on that?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I think you'd have to ask T-Mobile. What I've seen from their public comments is that they like their U.S. business, but they would exit it, for the proper consideration, they'd exit the U.S. business. Clearly, they were willing to do that with AT&T. Clearly, they had discussions with Sprint from public documents, so -- but where they stand on where they are today, I think they've got a lot of momentum and wind behind their back, at least for a short period of time, and you'd have to ask them.","Liana Baker","And then you also spoke highly of Sprint. And you said that you could still work with them in some way. Is that a network-sharing deal or some other kind of option?","Charles W. Ergen","I think -- look, I think there's a lot of options to working with Sprint. I think they're pretty innovative. But look, we did due diligence. We like their management team. We like -- we thought they had tremendous spectrum of portfolio with Clearwire. They just had a balance sheet problem. They were capital-constrained, and that's been alleviated by the acquisition of SoftBank. So they're -- it's a great asset. And I'm jealous that SoftBank's got them. But on the other hand, we know that asset pretty well, and we know we fit pretty well with it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shalini R. from Wall Street Journal.","Shalini Ramachandran","I just wanted to clarify. From your comments on this call, it seemed clear that perhaps you're more focused on figuring out wireless partnerships and\/or network-sharing deals more so than looking to a merger with DIRECT at this point. Is that a correct reading of what your thinking is right now?","Charles W. Ergen","We think -- I think, we're prudent. We look at everything, we think of everything, right? And look, there's not any question that putting DISH and DIRECTV together makes a lot of sense, right? I think that you have really -- but you have a couple issues there. One is we're at slightly different strategic directions, we're not sure which one's right, right? And secondly, you'd have to be pretty comfortable from a regulatory point of view that ultimately, regulators would say that, that's an achievable thing to do. And if you -- I think the events will happen. There may be consolidation in the cable industry that might drive you together. There could be things in the wireless industry that might drive us together. Or we might go our separate ways, right? But I think that there's no question that certainly -- let me put it this way, all I can do is speak for DISH. At DISH, we would certainly look at DIRECTV, and putting DISH and DIRECTV together, because we think that's obviously something that makes a lot of sense for -- strategically, right? So we are obviously going to look at that. We obviously would look at that. That doesn't mean -- we look at a lot of deals that don't get done, right? Sometimes it's personality. Sometimes you can't agree in the economics. Sometimes it's regulatory. Sometimes it's all of the above. We haven't ruled out anything. But we generally don't rule anything out, right? I mean, I think that's prudent management. And look, if you just looked at -- if you just wanted to create short-term value, that would be probably your #1 option.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Vuong from the Denver Post.","Andy Vuong","Just 2 quick questions. How far away is DISH from perhaps just shutting down the Blockbuster brand, or if that's even a consideration right now? And then was wondering if you guys might be able to provide more detail on the Hopper, and just how many of your subscribers have the Hopper and the Hopper with Sling? Or if you can offer a percentage of how many are still on the legacy systems and how many have switched over to the new box?","Joseph P. Clayton","All right. Andy, Joe Clayton here. In terms of Blockbuster, Robert went through the store count numbers. We ended the quarter, second quarter at 450. We're going to close another 100 stores between now and October. And we'll continue to look at the business on a store-by-store basis. Obviously, the lower the number, we're getting close to being profitable on the remaining stores. So we'll continue, as we stated in the past, to look at the business on a store-by-store basis.","Robert E. Olson","And Andy, this is Robert. With regard to your question on the Hopper, we haven't disclosed the Hopper percentages, either for our base or for our new connects. However, it has been growing steadily for the last year, and we're quite happy with the level of Hopper take rate.","Joseph P. Clayton","In fact it's...","Andy Vuong","I think last time, you guys mentioned, I think in January you mentioned there were maybe like 2 million homes with the Hopper and Joeys. You guys can't update that at this point since the Hopper...","Robert E. Olson","Andy, this is Robert again. That number included Hoppers and Joeys. So that was the total number of receivers. That was not a number which was -- that was not the number of customers that have the Hopper.","Andy Vuong","Okay. And just to follow-up on Blockbuster, I mean, it continues to bleed a little bit of cash. Do you guys have sort of like a time frame for when -- because when you first bought Blockbuster, part of the plan was to maybe sell cell phones in these stores. And now DISH really is still probably a couple of years out from doing that. Do you have sort of like a deadline for when you hope the business would turn around, and longer term, I guess, to keep it in the portfolio?","Robert E. Olson","Andy, this is Robert again. I think I mentioned on the call is that Blockbuster is a seasonal business. It does better in the first and fourth quarter. The fact that the second quarter was lower just indicates that -- some of that seasonality. We largely think of this as a breakeven business at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Williams from Satellite Business News.","Jeff Williams","As Congress looks at the expiration of some of the satellite TV laws, provisions next year, what are your preferences for what you'd like to see happen with that? Are you in favor of a straight reauthorization, or are there -- is there sort of a wish list you'd like to see come through?","R. Stanton Dodge","Sure. And this is Stanton. Top of list, hands down, which is consistent with a lot of the questions and responses on this call, is meaningful retransmission consent reform. And we put forth a plan that we think will level the playing field somewhat. Because as you know, today, it's an unfair fight. Back in the days when it was one cable company versus one broadcaster, there's somewhat of mutual assured destruction. Today, you've got one broadcaster playing 3, sometimes 4, MVPDs off against each other and demanding several hundred percent rate increases every time the negotiations come up. So we put a plan on the table, backed with Time Warner Cable and other folks in the industry, that would allow us to import distant signals during takedowns, which admittedly is not a perfect solution because you don't have local advertisements, local news, et cetera, but at least it would allow consumers to get -- keep access to their network programming during a takedown. So the consumers are less in the crosshairs and it also levels the playing field a bit. But hands down, that's our #1 hope, is it's a meaningful retransmission consent reform will get passed. We think there's some traction for that. Just by way of example, I think back in 2010, there were 10 takedowns. In 2011, there were 50. Last year, there were 100. As everyone knows, CBS is down on Time Warner right now. It's a problem. It's an escalating problem, and someone needs to do something about it.","Jeff Williams","Are all these filed as use giving you any sort of additional leverage in convincing lawmakers that you guys are on the right side of this issue?","R. Stanton Dodge","No, but we're hope -- it's causing folks to take notice, and it's a real problem.","Charles W. Ergen","We've never had leverage on anything in Congress. So I'm happy that somebody asked the question, but we've never had any leverage. We just try to make comments and arguments, right? We're trying to make comments into arguments and look, we started with retransmission ideas for a level playing field back in the very first authorization, the very first home satellite -- when we first did loc of [ph] local. We were the champions of loc of [ph] local. We worked on it single-handedly for a couple of years before other people joined the party, and we saw the risk of retransmission consent at the time. And our position hasn't changed over the last 10 years. It's only gotten -- obviously, many of the things we predicted have happened. So the consumer is the one that gets hurt. And if Congress hears from the consumers, they're there to serve their consumers, they'll take it seriously. If they don't hear from consumers, they won't take it seriously. And I think they're hearing, I imagine they're hearing from consumers right now, because there's a couple of takedowns now. I think both us, DIRECTV and Time Warner all have takedowns. And that's pretty unusual. And that's probably going to become the norm.","Operator","Your final question from the media comes from Erik Gruenwedel from Quest [ph].","Erik Gruenwedel","I had a question back to Blockbuster. Wasn't -- Blockbuster @Home, wasn't that sort of patterned after an over-the-top service? And Charlie, you made comments that you think the OTT business is not really in the best interest of DISH. But wasn't Blockbuster @Home going down that path?","Charles W. Ergen","I don't know that Blockbuster was going down that path. Blockbuster @Home is really a library of movies. So it's tens of thousands of movies for on video-on-demand that people can get. So I think it's a little bit of a different animal. Joe, do you want to maybe...","Joseph P. Clayton","It's 15 linear digital channels, so it's really a movie service. But we like the Blockbuster brand and the name, and we've had a great deal of success with the package.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. I kind of view OTT as live TV on the Internet, right? And if you look at OTT as a library of product, whether it be shows or movies, I mean, I think that's already happened. I think all the major providers are doing that from a catalog perspective. But it would be -- the real dynamic that would change is when live TV becomes -- live TV on a non-authenticated basis became available, that would be the game changer for the industry. And for the program content providers, I think content providers generally have looked at it and believe they would make less money in that particular model than they do today, but that might change, that might change for some of them. Obviously -- make sure you understand authentication. Our customers can watch live TV outside their homes for much of our product as long as they are, in fact, subscribers to that product. Then they get authenticated for outside the home. But they have to be a subscriber to the product. I think OTT might be a situation where you could view it inside or outside the home without having to buy a package of programming, more ala carte kind of stuff. Look, the consumer's ultimately going to drive that. And long term, I think they'll get more choice. And so we have to be prepared for that. We have to be prepared technically and everything else to do that. And that's kind of why we looked at it. But we didn't get as much -- we didn't get much -- we got very little enthusiasm from the content owners when we looked at it last year. They may have changed their mind, we haven't revisited that. But we got very little enthusiasm.","Thank you, all. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"7206":["DISH Network Corp.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jason Kiser, Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Kiser - DISH Network Corp.","Thank you. Well, thanks for joining us. This is Jason Kiser, joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman and CEO; Tom Cullen, EVP of Corporate Development; Erik Carlson, President of DISH Network; Steve Swain, our CFO; Paul Orban, our Controller; and Tim Messner, our new General Counsel.","So before we open up for Q&A, we're going to do our Safe Harbor disclosures and Tim take that.","Timothy A. Messner - DISH Network Corp.","Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone, thanks for joining us. A few reminders as we begin. First, we ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in your reports. We also don't allow audio taping and ask that you respect that. All statements that we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements, which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from historical results and from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a list of those factors, please refer to the front of our 10-Q.","All cautionary statements that we make during the call should be understood as being applicable to any forward-looking statements we make wherever they appear. You should carefully consider the risks described in our reports and not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which we assume no responsibility for updating.","With that said, I'll turn it over to Steve Swain, our CFO.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","A couple of quick comments on our subscribers. During September, Hurricane Maria caused extraordinary damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which resulted in widespread loss of power and infrastructure. Given the devastation and loss of power, substantially all customers in those areas were unable to receive our service as of September 30.","In an effort to ensure customers would not be charged for our services, we have proactively paused service for those customers. Accordingly, we removed approximately 145,000 subscribers from our third quarter ending Pay-TV count. This adjustment represents all of our subscribers in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.","In the 50 states, net Pay-TV subscribers grew approximately 16,000 in the third quarter. This growth included the impacts of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Combining the onetime removal of 145,000 subscribers in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands with the 16000 net additions in the 50 states, Pay-TV subscribers declined approximately 129,000.","Please note, in order to reflect the underlying trends in the business other metrics including gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations, net Pay-TV subscriber additions or losses and Pay-TV churn rate were not adjusted for the impact of Hurricane Maria.","In the week following Hurricane Maria, we have been focused on disaster recovery efforts such as setting up satellite Internet at hospitals and FEMA registration sites. Over the next year, it is our goal to economically reconnect to the majority of our subscribers in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.","However, we cannot predict when customers will be able to receive our service or how many may return to active subscriber status. In light of the situation, we expect to incur certain installation expenses in connection with reactivating our returning customers. For that reason, any returning customers will be recorded as gross new Pay-TV subscriber activations for the period in which they return.","Lastly, while we expect to have lost revenue and additional expenses as a result of Hurricane Maria, we do not expect them to have a material effect on our financial position or operating results.","With that I will open up the call to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess first Charlie could you talk about the wireless space in what looks like a long term for player market. How does that change your strategy around your spectrum and your ability to drive partnerships going forward?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I think it doesn't change anything too much other than perhaps there's a few more options on the table for us. But our vision of it really is that the wireless network of the future is more of a connectivity network and it's not just about people and going to phones and tablets, but it's more about connecting microprocessors and things in addition to connecting people.","And so there's going to be obviously hundreds of billions of things connected. So the \u2013 because there's a paradigm shift in the technology, particularly within 5G to connect a lot of things and because there are paradigm shifts in almost and disruption in almost every industry that we see out there and based on the fact that probably everything that people on this call have invested in need \u2013 those companies need massive connectivity in the future.","We have an opportunity to build a network that does that and it would be I don't know exactly what the right analogy is, but again it's a bit like starting an airline \u2013 you know it'd be like you be in the 1950s \u2013 be like being back in the 1950s and starting an airlines with all jet engines instead of having to start an airline with \u2013 instead of have an airline with a bunch of prop planes that you slowly upgraded to jet engines. So we have some advantages there.","Technology is all about timing. And we were very fortunate to hit the satellite television market when Congress had passed a law that cable programmers had to sell to us and that the technology was \u2013 had gotten good enough to build big satellites and the digital compression.","MPEG 2 was actually \u2013 actually worked not just in the laboratory but worked for consumers. So that \u2013 we hit that at the right timing. For wireless we think we hit that the right timing as 5G comes about and as connectivity becomes greater \u2013 a greater need for companies. And the people in the business today have really good networks for voice and design for voice, but they haven't and they can't overnight upgrade their networks to connectivity networks.","They'll get there over time, but they're changing the tires on the car going down the highway at 100 miles an hour and that's always difficult to do. Whereas we get to do it from a blank sheet of paper. So, and we think we have a few more options today. But we \u2013 no matter what we've always thought we'd be in a very competitive market.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","Your next question from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Charlie, have you started any dialogue with the \u2013 or your designated names starting a dialogue with the FCC on \u2013 following that court order that came out?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","We have made known that we're ready and available to talk to the FCC whenever they're ready to engage. So \u2013 but again those \u2013 I don't know how \u2013 I don't know whether that will be in a public forum or a private forum. So I think that's going to be up to the FCC to decide.","But obviously, we're encouraged that the court saw it kind of like \u2013 I think, I saw it, which is that historically, there's always been an opportunity to cure \u2013 if in fact, there was a control issue, there's always been an opportunity to cure that on a fair basis. And we were disappointed that we were denied that opportunity by the previous administration.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Also can you tell us if \u2013 I know you guys oppose the AT&T-Time Warner transaction. Has at DOJ come back to you in the past week, and I don't know what the proper terminology is, but I guess, trying to get the deposition out of you in preparation for the suit or a suit?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Nice try, but we're not going to comment on that.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Okay. And then just lastly, I guess, ops slice, Pay-TV business, the traditional, the sat business excluding Sling, I know you don't give out the individual numbers. But was the subscriber loss there better or worse than last quarter excluding the 140,000-plus hurricane impact?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And Erik may want to jump in on this, but in general, the \u2013 I'd say it this way. I think when I came back as CEO, probably the first thing I saw was that in an effort not to disappoint Wall Street, we did things that weren't \u2013 we didn't treat each customer economically. And we did things that we probably \u2013 we took on customers we probably shouldn't have. We gave big deals that we \u2013 free programming, things that we \u2013 probably weren't long-term economical for us. So really focused on the first \u2013 probably six months when I came back, that's the first thing we focused on.","And I think we \u2013 I think we as a company, got \u2013 maybe got ahead of the curve a little bit before other people did. And so Erik and his team have really stabilized. Linear TV has still got issues and still got problems, in part because of the way programmers continue to raise rates, while they have declining ratings and they have too much advertising revenue.","But having said that, the content's still really, really good. So it \u2013 to some degree, it's fixable with rational people starting making more rational long-term decisions. And so we were able to \u2013 we've been able to stabilize our core business a little bit better, even though it's a shrinking industry. It just continues to be a shrinking industry.","And we're also \u2013 we also have a bit of a floor in the sense that rural America is still a strong part of our company. And we have programming designed for rural America, and we have a lot of our distribution designed for rural America.","And so I think we've taken some of the hard licks. And not to say that \u2013 I'm not saying it's a linear business or growing business, but I think we're on firmer foundation than we were a couple years ago. Erik, do you want to \u2013 and not only the video business, other parts of our business, so...","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. I don't think there's too much to add there, Charlie, other than obviously we've taken a much more disciplined approach to satellite TV. And Charlie pointed out a more rural strategy, but also just a more disciplined strategy on obviously how we go about either acquiring or retaining customers. And I've talked a little bit about this in the past. But, obviously, on the retention side, it's really having programs in place to help right-size customers, versus just giving folks credits and having a discipline about which customers you're willing to kind of reinvest in or save.","So whether it's our Flex Pack, which gives customers choice, so we're not subsidizing television for the programmer and the customer. And a Flex Pack take care of you, (12:34) all three customers win. Whether it's going to customers that already have an off-air antenna and get broadcast and allow them to integrate off-air with obviously satellite TV. And that integration occurs in the guide and search and all that kind of stuff. And obviously they can drop their locals and save a bit of money. That also helps to right-size.","And then on the operational side, I mean, we definitely have improved, not only our discipline, but our ability to execute. And kind of a combination of those things really help us to, I think, have a longer tail on the linear satellite TV business. But it's we have focus and it's not easy. There's a lot of competition out there, and price value with OTT is obviously, it's growing, so...","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vijay Jayant with Evercore.","James Ratcliffe - Evercore Group LLC","Morning, it's James Ratcliffe for Vijay, and two if I could. First of all on the Pay-TV business, can you give us any color about where you're seeing the customer base from the virtual \u2013 at Sling coming from? I mean AT&T I think mentioned they thought only about 10% of their DTV Now customers were coming from DTV or U-verse. Are you seeing a similar trend, where the vast bulk are coming from the outside of the existing DISH platform?","And secondly, on the wireless side. Charlie, can you talk about any changes you've seen in the relative appeal or cost of adding wireless capacity through more spectrum versus through densification? Because it certainly seems like you're seeing players like Verizon pushing very hard on the densification front. Wondering if you're seeing any change in that dynamic? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, I'll take the wireless side of it. There's \u2013 it's not as simple as looking at kind of spectrum and maybe macro spectrum versus densification. Verizon was in a situation where they had to densify because Voice-over-IP, as opposed to \u2013 it requires a little bit denser network than GSM or CDMA. So there was already \u2013 but because of their millimeter wave acquisitions, that requires really, really, really dense network. So there's a bit more strategy to what they're doing than would be maybe normal in a network.","I think the key is going to be \u2013 I wouldn't densify for \u2013 I think there's not \u2013 I think as a general rule, as a general rule, it's going to be easy \u2013 it's going to be less costly and less OpEx, CapEx, and long-term cost to have spectrum versus densification.","The second thing I would say that even if that wasn't true, additional spectrum gives you another bullet in the gun long-term that you can always densify. The problem is that densification has limits. And so if you don't have enough spectrum, core spectrum going in, and you densify like crazy, and you still have connectivity needs in the future, you don't have any \u2013 you've reached the limit of densification.","And so, the first small cell cost X, but when you get to the 10th small cell, it's not nearly \u2013 the law of physics today, you're not \u2013 it's not really effective at all and it cost 10x. And so, it's \u2013 as a financial \u2013 former financial analyst, I think that those are \u2013 and then you end up a lot of costs with signal processing to reducing interference. So you hit us with a bunch of costs, you go look at the total system design. And as a generalization, I would say that I believe, strategically, you're better off with additional spectrum. And worse case is, you \u2013 even if I'm wrong, you can always densify in the future, whereas if you bet everything on densification, you are definitely in deep trouble if you run out of capacity.","So \u2013 and it's a bit more involved in that because you're starting to hear things about NFV and virtualized networks and virtualized cores and things like that. Those also play a role and, to some degree, to get to that technology, you've got to have a little bit more densification. And you're starting to hear about storage. At the edge, you need a little bit more densification for that.","So there is a method to the madness of densification. So \u2013 but you've got to look at it as a total system. And look, when you talk to Wall Street, your company, you don't always tell everybody everything. Because some part of your story is good and some part of your story is not so good. And it's up to you guys to go separate the wheat from the chaff. And on Sling, does anybody want to \u2013 do you want to take Sling, Erik?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. I think \u2013 look, traditionally when it comes to kind of Sling TV service cannibalizing the DBS service, from a geographic perspective, we've been focused on different areas, right? Charlie and I alluded to the idea that DBS traditionally has grown up kind of in rural America. That's where our strengths are, that's where our focus continues today, that's where our distribution is.","And so, generally, for Sling obviously to work, you need broadband. And so that points you more towards at a bit of an urban, suburban type profile. And so, we're not seeing \u2013 just based on our targeting strategy, we're not seeing a ton cannibalization on the Sling service to the DBS service.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. And I would just add that our vision of OTT was to go \u2013 I felt like that we, as an industry, lost an entire generation of people in Pay-TV. And it was difficult until Disney made a kind of a courageous choice at the time to say, we'll do OTT. Everybody else kind of liked the idea of OTT, but not unless everybody else did it. So there was not a lot of leadership until Disney came in.","But our goal was to go get back and get that generation that we've lost in Pay-TV. It is a \u2013 so there wasn't much overlap in between Sling and DISH at all initially. That trend is changing slightly whether it's a bit more overlap as things like DIRECTV NOW coming to the marketplace which is really a replacement for cable, really it's almost cable \u2013 exactly, cable just an OTT format. So \u2013 and then people like YouTube and Hulu and others. So that is now a \u2013 now OTT is going more mainstream. That may be a good thing or a bad thing, but it is changing. And we're still \u2013 and so we'll change with it, obviously.","James Ratcliffe - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question from John Hodulik with UBS.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. Could you guys talk about competition in the live streaming market? It seems like YouTube, Hulu, and DIRECTV NOW have all gotten a little bit more aggressive in trying to increase their profile. Has that affected the sort of growth rate that you're seeing at Sling? And then, Charlie, getting back to that point where you talked about the sort of evolution of the wireless market, do you think that live streaming TV returns the sort of live TV bundle to growth, sort of similar to what Fox was saying last night or do you expect a decline in the overall number of Pay-TV subs going forward? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, you're correct. There is a tremendous amount of competition in the OTT space. I mean, there is probably approaching a dozen companies, some \u2013 when you start putting Google in there and then Hulu, of course owned by the content providers themselves, there's certainly a tremendous amount of competition there. Having said that, it's still going to boil down to \u2013 and not everybody's selling exactly the same thing. And so what's going to happen is that the market's going to get more fragmented. And as a result, that's consumers will have some choices. And not only will they have choices, but they can move between packages with a click of a button on the Internet.","So I think that that's going to be tricky for content providers because not everybody has to buy sports programming. Not everybody has to buy NOW, whereas in traditional linear bundle, there was a 90% chance you're going to have to buy a sports bundle. That's not the case in OTT and certainly not the case probably where OTT goes. So I think it's going to be tricky for content providers, because the market gets a little bit more segmented.","There is better advertising opportunity because it's a unicast and we can do an interactive ad to consumers. I think that the content's gone \u2013 beyond traditional content \u2013 I've always said that the people who have had skin in the game, who launch satellites or built cable or built fiber were going to \u2013 would take a bit \u2013 a different approach to actually run programming as a profit and loss.","As you get into things like YouTube, they make their money on data. So they would not necessarily \u2013 they want eyeballs, they don't necessarily care about security and piracy as an example, as much as say DISH, where we have our own in-house force to look at people who are pirating things. We have 85 boxes in our lab today that steal programming on the Internet from companies, right? That's not something that the content owners anticipate and they don't totally understand it, so they \u2013 but they understand they get a contract and they get a headline and maybe their stock goes up for a week, but they don't understand the unintended consequences.","So I think there's some real potential problems out there. Having said that, and also now gets people thinking about on the \u2013 linear TV is not dead. And linear TV is suffering declines, in part because it's not as good a product. It's more expensive. Rates have gone up while viewership goes down. And probably the worst thing is that the commercial load is so \u2013 so you're talking about 30% of the viewing minutes are commercials, that's an unhealthy consumer experience.","And so, there's things we could do as an industry to change that. And if the industry starts thinking about creative ways to compete then that marketplace can stabilize a little bit. And so we have a good feel for it. We understand the industry pretty well. We understand the piracy side. we understand the consumer side. We understand the profit, P&L side of the business pretty well. We understand the technology side of the business pretty well. And so we think we can offer solutions to people that can make our industry a little bit better. And we think we're well positioned for that.","But how people go and what people think short term or long term or decisions they make, we're not the person who deals with that. We're not the bigger company. So we play the cards that are that dealt to us, and we think within the video business that we still \u2013 that that's a real good business and has \u2013 the content has \u2013 and the distribution system for content has a lot of legs. And we're involved in the satellite side, we're involved on the broadband side with OTT, so we're well positioned there and we're certainly well-positioned for the connectivity side and wireless long term. Not many companies can say that.","John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just two questions. And the first one is just to clarify around the suspended accounts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The way I heard your remarks, it sounds like all of the financial impact of that is going to begin occurring in the fourth quarter. But I was hoping you can clarify. Were there any revenue credits or revenue reserves at all in the third quarter? And then on the cost side, as you suspend these accounts, that mean that you're not going to be paying and incurring the programming expenses?","And then the bigger picture question I have is, on the last call, I believe it was the last call, you were talking about how it taken a really long time to develop the advertising platform at Sling, but you really felt like you were starting to get it. And I'm just curious if you could give us some view here on how you think the addressable advertising opportunity is going to start scaling at Sling, and if you're getting to a point where you think that's going to start factoring into the revenues of that product in a more meaningful way? Thank you.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. On the first question, because the hurricane was on the 19th and 20th of September, we did have a slight revenue adjustment in the third quarter, both to us as well as the customers. And then, you're right. If we don't have paying customers, we don't pay programmers. So that's just the way that works.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","But you can run the math. You lose \u2013 145,000 customers going to pause, and you \u2013 what's our ARPU? $87 a month, might be a little bit less in Puerto Rico. But you can see the impact of that till customers come, on the revenue side. Right?","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And then, we don't have the cost for that customer, right? So \u2013 but you could probably extrapolate the impact. Having said that, we believe that that's not a long-term material impact on us.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","In fact, to some degree, there's a bit of an opportunity in Puerto Rico, because I think Liberty Global, who's the cable company in Puerto Rico, I think they just \u2013 that they don't know that that \u2013 I mean, I'm guessing that they're devastated as well as we were. And they haven't disclosed yet the impact other than \u2013 they kind of counted their customers as through August 31. So they don't know the \u2013 they don't probably don't know the \u2013 they probably know the impact now, but they probably didn't know the impact when they reported.","So those customers are going to take a long time to come online. And satellite's a little bit easier to bring online than that. So there could be some opportunity for us, but it is \u2013 that island is devastated, and it's \u2013 we spent a lot more time on the humanitarian efforts than on the P&L side of it at first, which I think \u2013 I'm proud of our guys for doing that.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And on the addressable advertising?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","A majority of our \u2013 some of the programs have been a bit slow, but the majority of our programs on Sling now have dynamic ad insertion, where we can stream an individual ad. And again, as we get better and better at that and as the tools get better and better at that, that's going to be something that continues to go \u2013 grow from a revenue opportunity for both programmers and us.","And I think that we're on the leading edge of that technology, and it's certainly not easy. But as programmers see some of the results, they're getting more excited about that. So it definitely is one of the keys to making OTT profitable.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I have two questions for Steve and then sort of a big picture for Charlie. So, Steve, given pressure on EBITDA at the core DBS business, I guess how do you stay comfortable with your leverage and paying debt down? And then as a corollary to that, how can you keep free cash flow stable? What are the puts and takes?","And then the bigger picture question for Charlie, I'm just going to ask you what I get asked. At the current stock price, you're either getting spectrum at a massive discount, or there's negative equity value for the DBS business. So what do you think the market is getting wrong?","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","All right. So, Marci, the \u2013 your first question on DBS pressure, leverage, free cash flow, it's all kind of combined. We do look at fundamentals. As Charlie mentioned, with the backdrop of traditional Pay-TV distribution maturing and now declining, we're laser-focused on cash flow.","I'll go through the different products that we have, satellite, Sling TV and dishNET, and how we look at it 2017 and going forward. For DBS, as Erik and Charlie already mentioned, we're acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers in rural geographies where we see less bundling pressure. And we are more disciplined on retention core credits, as well as we are executing on several cost initiatives to offset some of the programming price increases.","We're also right-sizing our customers into skinnier packages. Erik already mentioned Flex Pack. And we're also \u2013 we've also introduced the Hopper and antenna solution, where customers can drop locals and save.","Lastly, to partially offset some of the EBITDA pressure that we see on DBS, we're spending less on PP&E CapEx by using more remanufactured boxes versus buying new.","Looking at Sling TV, we are seeing ARPU and margin expansion. For example, Charlie already mentioned this, we're seeing ARPU tailwinds from increasing addressable advertising revenue, as we have more and more channels available for sale for addressable advertising, as well as incremental products like DVR. And as you would expect, Sling TV is certainly gaining scale as it grows.","dishNET, we've pivoted from the wholesale model where we are now seeing a very modest P&L favorability due to lower acquisition costs.","Looking at beyond operations into interest payments and taxes with incremental debt year-over-year primarily from low coupon convertible bonds, cash interest expense is up on a year-over-year basis. But cash tax, without a sizable taxable gain from derivatives, like we had last year, with lower 2017 pre-tax income, higher cash interest, and planning for the incremental tax deduction from amortizing our newly acquired 600 megahertz licenses, we are expecting to pay significantly less cash tax in 2017.","So because we're focused on cash, we are comfortable that we'll have the flexibility as we hit maturities, which are spaced out nicely over the next several years, that we'll have the flexibility to pay those maturities off or have flexibility in the market.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. And this is Charlie. I don't know that the marketplace is getting anything wrong that in the sense \u2013 I think it's more of a question of short term versus long term. I think if you looked at \u2013 if you \u2013 and so what \u2013 I used to be a financial analyst, and so when you \u2013 and I always \u2013 the guys here all know, I always teach that you look at the numbers. And then you take a step backward and look at all the other factors. I call it outhouse logic. But you look at all the other factors that affect it.","So as an example, if you're around a bunch of aerospace engineers, they would say a bumblebee can't fly. Because look at the aerodynamics of a bumblebee. I look at outhouse logic and say, I see it flying, I'm pretty sure it flies. And so if you look at the math in short term, maybe we're fairly valued. Maybe we're overvalued, I don't know.","But long term because, first of all, our video business \u2013 we probably don't get as much credit for our video business as we should. It's not dead, it's still a very, very profitable business, and there's things that the industry can do to continue to do that if they move in that direction.","And then the connectivity side, people underestimate just how \u2013 there is an \u2013 I've never talked to a CEO in the last \u2013 CEO for any company, including Fortune 500, who doesn't need massive connectivity to do it. And there are companies that are worth over $500 billion today, one worth almost $1 trillion, that they don't have a business unless they're connected.","And their debt \u2013 that'd be a scary position if your whole net worth was \u2013 if most of your profits were based on connectivity and you don't have any more insight into it today. And if you want to keep that connectivity, and you want to reduce your cost and be more efficient, you're going to have to get to more \u2013 you're going to have to move from the cloud to the edge.","And when you do that, wireless connectivity just plays a bigger part. And you name it, whether it be artificial intelligence or virtual reality, autonomous vehicles or industrial or municipalities or healthcare or consumers and homes and everything else, the efficiency gains, the connectivity and from what we're going to be able to do within a 5G technology is going to be massive. And they are going \u2013 the next big $500 billion company is going to come out of connectivity.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group","Great. Thank you. On Sling, could you give us a little color on what's happening with churn? Is that increasing or decreasing? And what have you found to be the drivers of the churn? Is it the quality of service? Is it sampling? Is it folks that were looking for certain channels? And then I guess more strategically, you talked about targeting certain markets. Could you give us a sense of which broadband provider most of your Sling TV subscribers use? And has that changed over time? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yes, I don't \u2013 I'm not sure we know the broadband providers. I mean, it would typically skew pretty much what you see in market share with cable industry having a bigger \u2013 the biggest piece of market share. And we probably track almost \u2013 virtually identical to the market share of the cable guys versus, say, the phone guys.","The churn is, I think the biggest \u2013 not surprise to us, but the biggest kind of lesson learned is that churn within OTT is much more seasonal than it has been in linear TV. For example, if you are a college football fan, you're probably are going to subscribe to \u2013 but let's say, you're not a big NBA fan or a hockey fan, you probably are going to subscribe to ESPN for September, October, November, and December. But you're probably not going to \u2013 you're probably going to \u2013 you might go to a different package or a different OTT provider for the rest of the year.","I mean, if you're a big Game of Thrones fan, but not necessarily \u2013 and you have Netflix, you'd probably be an HBO subscriber for six weeks out of the year, but you don't \u2013 you've got plenty of movies on Netflix, so you don't \u2013 so maybe you switch or maybe switch between Showtime and HBO, depending on the series. So obviously, there's things that content provider can do to have content throughout the year, and I'm sure they're working on those kinds of things.","But there's a bit more seasonal approach to it, and I don't think we totally understand that but we know that that's there. And then obviously, you're going to have to have good user interface and good technology. In other words, consistent service, which is extremely difficult to do for live TV when you don't control the Internet, the public network, it's \u2013 that's extremely difficult but you have to have a rival service, and those are factors that we see from consumers.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group","Is there anything that you guys can do on Sling in terms of the programming to lower the churn?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I mean \u2013 yeah, I mean, I think we need content that is relevant to people all year long, and then make it \u2013 and then provide a consistent service and a user interface that's easy for customers. When they go somewhere else, the grass looks greener, but they come back because the other system doesn't work as well, right? Or we have content packaged in a way that the other person doesn't have it.","So it's \u2013 I will say that today, there's three or four of the biggest guys, not named Sling, look pretty much alike. And I think that, that \u2013 so they get a buyer for the same customer. We look a little different with Sling. We actually have three packages for people, and we look a little different. And so we're not attractive to some people but the majority of people, I think, like what we have.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thanks. Charlie, two questions, if it could. One, I wonder if we could just dig into this economics of Sling that you've been talking about a little bit, and if you could just revisit some of the comments you've made in the past about the customer lifetime value of Sling customers versus traditional satellite customers. I know that the customer acquisition cost is obviously dramatically different. But if you could just maybe put some more meat on the bones about the total customer lifetime value and how you think about it?","And then second, if you could just clarify for when you talk about connectivity in your wireless business, are you still talking about a narrowband IoT network? Or are you now going back to the more broadband data network that you've been talking about in the past, because I think architecturally they would be quite different?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And I'll let Tom take that second question, Craig. On Sling, I think it's still a little bit remains to be seen, but the technology of OTT and what we're able to do with Sling and the platform that we have it, we believe that customer will have a longer term life than a linear subscriber in the urban markets.","And there are \u2013 and so, I don't know, that \u2013 obviously, the SAC could be virtually nothing once you get a customer and you get them on your profile, and if he leaves you to come back. And again, the advertising model and the relationship with the consumer through a direct connection, there's a lot of revenue opportunities there that maybe aren't evident today.","So I don't think it's proven yet. But we like the technology of what we're able to do with reaching customers through an app, that allows us to do a lot of things beyond just TV. So, with that I'll maybe...","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Craig, on the wireless side, what Charlie was referring to earlier around 5G and massive connectivity, we view that as more Phase 2 after the 5G standards are defined, after our 600 megahertz spectrum is cleared, and so forth. So that's probably a 2020 and beyond thought.","In the interim, we are still focused on the narrowband IoT build as we shared in March with the FCC, had a very good quarter in terms of progress. We've expanded the wireless team considerably. We've finalized contracts with more than one global vendor for radio access equipment and other associated equipment that goes on towers. We're in negotiations right now with several chipset and module vendors, which we hope to finalize in the next couple of months.","We've initiated contact with a wide range of tower owners and have begun those discussions as well. So we think we'll have some of those agreements wrapped up early in 2018. So \u2013 because of the unique spectrum configuration of meeting our license requirements for both AWS-4 and 700 megahertz, the radios require development. So we've paid those development fees and we would expect to have radios later in 2018 and begin deployment shortly thereafter.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","But that \u2013 that's a much \u2013 that's a material \u2013 that's not a network that's going to be a paradigm shift for our business, right? But it is a network that's going to give us \u2013 that is a network that's going to work and going to provide value, and maybe even more importantly, and it's going to \u2013 consumers are going to be able to use it and companies are going to be able to use it.","But it's the testbed for us to get to that second phase which is basically, it's probably revolutionary, the ability to connect in a way that you just can't today. And we're not saying \u2013 we're not totally wireless experts. We don't have 30 years in the wireless business and we need to learn and one of the things that we need to learn and we also need to learn to work with certain companies who become our partners long term.","And it's exactly the way we did the satellite business where we still had the same partners, but we start building our first satellite in 1992, we still have many of those same partners, and we didn't really know anything about satellite at that time. And we got a lot of help. And people were willing to help us and people were willing to partner with us. And there's a lot of people in the wireless business that are willing \u2013 are doing the same thing. We're appreciative that they want to take chances on us, and we're all in.","And I never thought we get a second chance to do something pretty revolutionary. And we're able to do that and we're building that team of people to do that. And there's no guarantee of success, but logically \u2013 outhouse logically \u2013 there's not any question in my mind that people have to be connected. And I don't understand AI, and I don't understand virtual reality, and I don't understand smart grids. And I don't understand jet engines that download terabytes of data every millisecond. And I just don't understand any of that stuff. There's people in Silicon Valley, I don't understand what they do. But I've never seen one of those guys that can make money without being connected.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","So, Craig, just to finalize on that, we're very confident in meeting the March 2020 requirements for those licenses. And we're also encouraged by the growing adoption of narrowband IoT. You've probably seen a number of the global operators announcing deployments already with new consumer products just in the last couple weeks.","So there's an opportunity there for us to cooperate with some of those carriers. And we've had those discussions as they start satisfying the needs of multi-national deployments.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","And just to make sure I understand, so because you won't have the 600 megahertz in time for the 2020 deadline, does that mean that both the downlink and the uplink initially in the IoT network are going to be done in your AWS-4 band and AWS-3? Or is there a different architecture there?","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","We haven't shared the spectrum configuration that we're deploying, but it will be consistent and compliant with 3GPP.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","But I think, Craig, we \u2013 for 2020 we're certainly looking within the AWS-4 and 700 megahertz bands.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","So does that mean using 700 megahertz for uplink?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Who \u2013 I didn't hear that? Oh, he's asking about the network.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Using the 700 megahertz?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Oh, we don't \u2013 yeah, our 700 megahertz is downlink. Yeah, so 700 megahertz...","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Obviously, we have uplink, but we'll \u2013 we're not sharing the configuration.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I think we have very creative solutions, let's put it that way. But they're not standard radios, which is why we're having to pay develop \u2013 why we're paying development fees and stuff to do it right. But it's not material, but it's creative. And so we haven't shared those creative details yet I guess, is fair.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","So operator I think we have time for one more question from the analyst community.","Operator","We will now take our final question from the analyst community. Our final analyst question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I just had a quick question for Mr. Ergen, regarding keeping the video business and the spectrum together under one stock. Is that motivated by financial considerations, meaning you need the free cash flow to build something out? Or do you still see strategic merits in keeping them together, even though we're talking more about an IoT network than we were maybe three years ago?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, well, realize the IoT space won. So we really \u2013 but the answer is yes, we think strategically they go together. We think that the marketplace maybe is a little ahead of their skis on bashing video business.","But the biggest use of a modern \u2013 the biggest use in terms of data on networks in the future is probably going to be video. So they make sense to being together.","Having said that, we're not rigid. I mean if somebody's got a better idea and there's an opportunity and the net-net effect is a positive for our shareholders, we certainly take a look at that. But as we sit here today, those assets were built for a purpose. Those assets go together for a purpose. And we think \u2013 we just think that maybe the marketplace is \u2013 doesn't appreciate solid foundation of the video side of the business. But we may be wrong, too.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. Thank you.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Okay, operator. Let's move to the press.","Operator","We will now take questions from members of the media. Our first media question comes from Gerry Smith with Bloomberg News.","Gerry Smith - Bloomberg LP","Yeah. Hi, Mr. Ergen. I'm actually filling in for my colleague Scott Moritz. I want to follow up. You said earlier in the call that you see more options today in wireless for DISH. Are you referring to the Sprint\/T-Mobile talks collapsing, and one of those companies possibly being a partner?","And then if I might ask a second question. I know you said you didn't want to comment about whether DOJ had called you guys in regarding the AT&T and Time Warner deal. But was wondering if you had any thoughts in general about the AT&T\/Time Warner deal and specifically this idea that DIRECTV might get sold off?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Was that a \u2013 you think that's a \u2013 I'm just off subject. Do you think that was a question about that? Is that...","Unknown Speaker","Yes.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Then you owe me $1.","Unknown Speaker","You owe Bernie $5. Thank you very much.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Sorry, we just have some internal bets here going. And your question is important though, so we'll try to answer it.","The optionality, the answer is yes. That in part, if Sprint and T-Mobile are not going to attempt to go together, then that obviously perhaps \u2013 or some other option. But that's not the only options that are kind of out there. And I think that there continue to be \u2013 as people get a better understanding for connectivity, there continue to be additional kind of options.","On AT&T\/Time Warner, I can only say in general, my experience has been \u2013 you're talking to a guy who the DOJ \u2013 that we turned down \u2013 they turned down our merger with DIRECTV and, of course, paid at that time one of the largest breakup fees ever. At the time, we didn't have quite that much money.","So \u2013 but having said that, I've learned through the experience with DOJ that they \u2013 that despite may be what you read in the press and everything that it's a pretty \u2013 that they actually have a lot of information that perhaps we don't have or the press doesn't have because they do a pretty thorough analysis of things, and the staff in particular, look at it per the law and look at data that we don't have.","And despite the fact that I was very disappointed that they turned our merger down, I grew \u2013 I had a great deal of respect for what I learned in that process of how they do their job, so I wouldn't ever second guess \u2013 I wouldn't say never, but I wouldn't probably second guess the process and we'll see how that merger proceeds.","I think by no means is it dead and I think there's certainly maybe ways that they can work it out. So we'll see. But we think there's definitely legitimate concerns about that merger, right? There definitely would be a huge concentration of content and distribution in one company and the net effect of that, as many people have highlighted in the press and to the Justice Department, certainly could have negative impacts on the consumer. And ultimately, their job is to protect the consumers.","Gerry Smith - Bloomberg LP","Thank you.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Okay. I think there are no other \u2013 are there other media questions in queue, operator?","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","All right.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Jason Kiser. Please go ahead.","Jason Kiser","Thanks for joining us, everybody. I am joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman; Tom Cullen, EVP, Corporate Development; Erik Carlson, our CEO; Brian Neylon, President of DISH; Warren Schlichting, the President of Sling, Paul Orban, our CFO; and Tim Messner, our General Counsel. ","Before we have opening remarks from Erik, Paul and I think Charlie, we need to do our Safe Harbor disclosure. So for that, I will turn it over to Tim. ","Tim Messner","All right. Thanks, Jason.","Statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical facts constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ from historical results and\/or from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings.","All cautionary statements that we make during this call are applicable to any forward-looking statements we make wherever they appear. You should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings. Do not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which we assume no responsibility for updating.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Erik Carlson, our CEO.","Erik Carlson","Thank you, Tim, and welcome, everyone. And thanks for joining us at the last minute. Given all the news, we're going to have a few short remarks today about the results and our wireless news and then leave plenty of time for questions.","First, I\u2019d like to share my thanks to the DISH team for all the work that\u2019s made these wireless developments possible. These are transformative days for us, and we look forward to sharing our progress as these deals advance.","Let me speak briefly to the quarter, and Paul will have a bit more color. We are committed to our long-term strategy of delivering the best service, technology and value for our customers. It's the path we have to take it forward to stand out in our challenging Pay-TV environment and succeed in the future.","The second quarter results demonstrate that our continued focus on attracting loyal, high-quality and profitable subscribers continues to work in our favor. Customer profitability is near all-time highs. Our efforts to find the right prospects in the right areas with the right credit and turn those prospects into customers are bearing fruit.","As a proof point, we saw a sequential and year-over-year gross subscriber growth in DISH TV. In the second quarter, we added 348,000 subscribers compared to 243,000 the last quarter and 278,000 a year ago period. In terms of our overall Pay-TV subscriber trends, we saw a net decline of 31,000 compared to a loss of 259,000 in the first quarter and a loss of 151,000 subscribers in the year-ago period.","This quarter, I\u2019m pleased to report that we achieved a near-record churn at 1.48%. This is attributed to the focus we placed on our long-term goals, goals that include a data-driven approach to acquisitions and a call for operational discipline from teams across the business.","Touching on wireless, I\u2019m confident you all understand the contours of the transactions that we announced Friday. Let me offer you a little color. These agreements and commitments set us in a clear course to become a fourth wireless providers of the nation, and it\u2019s going to happen quickly. The agreements accelerate our entry into the market as a facilities-based 5G broadband wireless provider. June 14, 2023 is now our deadline to provide 70% of the nation's population access to our 5G broadband network. But, we have lots of work ahead of us to land Boost and begin the 5G build out. And I\u2019m confident in our grafted fundamentals and I'm certainly confident in our ability to execute.","Next week is my 24th year at DISH. I joined the Company just a few months ahead of our EchoStar I launch. At that time, we had DBS customers, and today we serve millions. We launched Sling TV in February of 2015 and today we have millions of customers where we continue to lead in the live OTT category. We\u2019ve got a top-flight team that manages three high-profile national brands in DISH TV, Sling TV and DishLATINO in support of dealer network that\u2019s thousand strong and we have a vital direct sales operation. Our people and systems support hundreds of thousands customer interactions a day, and we do these things well.","DISH is prepared to support the Boost and Virgin subscribers with excellent service, excellent technology and excellent value. And we are well-positioned to develop market and support and service, based on the nation's first 5G standalone broadband network.","Paul, take it away.","Paul Orban","Thank you, Erik.","As we\u2019ve been talking about for the past several quarters and to eco Erik, our core Pay-TV business continues to focus on acquiring and retaining high-quality subscribers who are profitable to us over the long term. We believe that we are ahead of the curve compared to most of our competitors.","As Erik said, we achieve near-record low churn and increased DISH gross additions with all-time high credit scores. We also saw positive subscriber growth on Sling, we continue to improve the platform and user experience. This quarter, we added 48,000 net Sling subscribers, up 7,000 from last year.","And looking at the P&L, our operating income and EBITDA are both down compared to last year, primarily due to a lower subscriber base and higher SAC. For revenue, the lower subscriber base was partially offset by higher ARPU due to price increases and improved revenue in ad sales at both DISH and Sling. These increases were impacted by higher percentage of Sling TV subscribers present in the overall Pay-TV subscriber base.","We also saw a decrease in premium channel revenue, mainly related to the removal of HBO. For subscriber expenses, our margins have been relatively stable. However, we continue to face long-term pressure from programmers who want higher and higher rates even in the face of declining viewership. Programming expenses were positively impacted by the HBO channel removal.","Turning to subscriber acquisition costs. Investments in more subscribers in the quarter had a negative impact on operating income and EBITDA. With that said, we believe that the investments we are making in acquiring high-quality subscribers will pay off over the long term. DISH TV SAC increased $786 per activation, up from $763 last year. The increase in DISH TV SAC was due to higher hardware and advertising costs per activation.","Note that we continue to supply a higher percentage of our new customers with higher priced Hopper receivers. While this impacts SAC, we believe offering our best equipment influences loyalty over the long-term, by delivering a better customer experience.","G&A expenses were up this quarter, as a result of costs to support our wireless initiatives and legal fees. In the first half of the year, we generated over $600 million in free cash flow, despite increases in wireless CapEx. We ended the second quarter with $2.7 billion of cash and investments. This will be more than adequate to redeem the $1.3 billion remaining on our September debt maturity.","With respect to Boost, we feel confident in our ability to pay the $1.4 billion purchase price with cash on hand when the transaction closes. As we said before, we'll be opportunistic in accessing the capital markets.","Finally, during the quarter, we announced agreement to acquire the majority of the EchoStar Satellite Services segment, as well as certain real estate in exchange for our stock. Upon closing, this transaction should significantly reduce our satellite and transmission expenses, and as a result, we should see improvement in both free cash flow and EBITDA.","With that, I'll turn it over to Charlie for a few brief comments.","Charlie Ergen","Thanks, Paul.","Normally, I wouldn\u2019t comment, but I just wanted to briefly set the stage for your questions.","Let's talk about what's changed and of course obviously a big change with the agreement with the T-Mobile and Sprint, and the acquisition of the Boost brand and the customers, and the Virgin customers and the Sprint -- and the three big Sprint customers. We were able to enter the marketplace in a very timely manner with just over 9 million subscriber, something that we -- I didn\u2019t think that we\u2019d have to build the company from -- build the retail side of the business from scratch. Now, we get a key ingredient, a key business to move forward from and really just jumpstarts us to get into the business. ","We're also acquiring a seven-year MVNO deal, a very competitive MVNO deal, but also for -- seven years, but -- so that we get the provision on the new T-Mobile network, which obviously is going to become even better network as they build out -- and the Sprint spectrum. More importantly something that\u2019s not understood is that we of course get to build our own network out and we get to provision customers on our own network but then we get to run own a T-Mobile network, which allows us to build on a market by market basis, which is materially different than we envisioned where we believed we had to build the whole country at one time. Now, we can be in business as soon as we build our first market with owner economics. And I'm sure you will have more questions about that.","Additionally, the DISH FCC where we have been going -- where we had been going in kind of opposite directions, where we\u2019re building based on our license, the flexible use license and narrowband IoT network to meet our build out requirements. We\u2019re now more in alignment where the FCC wants to go, which is they want to see 5G mobile broadband built out, and as a result of this transaction we\u2019re now totally aligned with that where we have voluntarily changed our flexible use licenses to mobile broadband licenses in return for realistic -- 2023 before we can build 70% of the country out.","But, we're now in alignment where I think the country wants to go, where I think -- I know the FCC wants to go, where I know we want to go, I think where the administration and the Congress wants to go. As result, our NB-IoT, narrowband IoT resources will be redeployed in the short-term for that 5G network because MVNO deal on T-Mobile allows us to use their nationwide NB-IoT that\u2019s already built out. So, there is no reason to duplicate that network, particularly with some nonstandard frequencies.","What's not new is that we still plan on building a network out and spending about $10 billion to do that. Having said that, with the MVNO deal with T-Mobile, we\u2019re able to extend our build out for some of the less profitable areas longer term. So, our initial [indiscernible] will actually be less than we had envisioned short-term, and as a result our OpEx should be less than we had ultimately envisioned. But the $10 billion investment is still in the cards.","And what\u2019s not news, we\u2019re going to need help. We\u2019re going to need help from people to help us better [ph] network, just like we needed help back when we decided to launch satellite. So, there is people that have many of the things that we need, whether it be backhaul, whether it be towers, whether it be mobile edge compute, whether it\u2019d be hardware or software, whether it\u2019d be distribution and marketing, all those things are things that we're going to need.","Our philosophy really is where somebody else has some of those things, we don't intend to reinvent it, rebuild it, if they want to work with us. If they don't want to work with us, then obviously, then, we\u2019ll do it ourselves. And when we did satellite way back, when there were many times -- most times people had things in place and wanted to work with us, but there were few cases where people didn't believe in us or I didn\u2019t think we would be successful when we end up having to build those things ourselves.","So, with that I think, we will take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from David Barden with Bank of America.","David Barden","He, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I really appreciate it. I guess, a couple. First would be, could you guys give us the shape of the EBITDA of the business that you are acquiring from the Sprint, T-Mobile divestiture? Obviously, they\u2019ve got one number, you\u2019ve got a different number based on your relationship. It will be helpful to get an understanding what that is. And then, I guess, second, Charlie, when you say you need help from people, I think, one of the biggest things is going to be getting the money to kind of build this plan out. The Wall Street Journal reported that you spent like three weeks putting the plan together. What is the plan to bring the funding to bear and the shape of the plan? If you could kind of give us a little bit of color on that would be super helpful. Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","This is Charlie. I\u2019ll try to take it. In terms of EBITDA of the existing Sprint business, that\u2019s really -- we\u2019ll probably leave it up to them to talk about what their probability is. Obviously, the way they would look at it internally and the way we would look at it would be little bit different. Because we know that in the short-term we\u2019re paying for the new T-Mobile network, different economics than perhaps on the old Sprint network. And then, obviously, as we build out our own network, our economics change materially different.","So, having said that, I think maybe just to give you some kind of guidance like TracFone, who we believe we have a very competitive deal compared to their deals, and look at their financials to give you a feel for the base case would be, where you're using somebody else's network in terms of what their profit would be. And then, obviously, as we use our own -- as we build our own network, use our own tower to get owner economics, that materially changes in a positive way.","As far as where we get the money to move the network forward, a lot of different places. So, we obviously have cash on hand in the business, we obviously are generating cash flow, which has been in excess of $1 billion for a lot of years. In terms of our existing business, where we believe that the Boost and our entry into marketplace will be a positive from a cash flow perspective. The marketplaces are open to us and certainly today and there is opportunistic things. And I certainly am willing to put more money in this company because that\u2019s what it takes to. ","And then, finally, the one of the things in this agreement is our 600 megahertz spectrum, which today is as we wait for the broadcaster spectrum at which T-Mobile has taken aggressive stance there. Some of that spectrum is fallow today, in fact all of our spectrum today is fallow. And Department of Justice is requiring both companies to use good faith efforts on a market base deal for them to leave their capacity until such time as we use it.","So, to give you an example, we have moved our build up schedule out by four years from 2029 to 2025 as part. So, we have accelerated our build out of 600 but all of our 600 is not going to be built out in 2025. So, it gives you a feel for some possible revenue opportunities there as well.","David Barden","Thank you so much, Charlie. As a follow-up, just real quick. As a gambling man, what would you put the odds that the state AGs [ph] are going to win or lose in their efforts to block this deal?","Charlie Ergen","First of all, I\u2019m not a gambler. So, when you gamble, that means that you don\u2019t know the odds, and that means that when you gamble -- in fact, if you play in Vegas, other than blackjack, in only certain times at blackjack, the odds are against you. So, that would be a gamble. But, when you actually understand, like blackjack and count cards, it\u2019s not a gamble because the odds are in your favor. So, I\u2019m not really a gambler, but -- from that perspective. But, look, I think as the -- I think to the credit of the FCC, in particular the Justice Department, I think, they\u2019ve structured this agreement so that we feel very good about our ability to compete as a fourth entrant to this marketplace, both in the short term, particularly and obviously in the long term. I do think that the states played a role and I think that the states, had -- my person opinion is that big influence on T-Mobile and Sprint, their willingness to be more aggressive, to give us the of kind things that we needed to be competitive that they otherwise might not have an obviously DoJ forced some of those issues, but I think you have to get some credit to the states as well. So, when you look at all of that, I think that I would rather have the Department of Justice case than not.","Tom Cullen","Yes. This is Tom. We\u2019re not in the business of handicapping that outcome. But, as Charlie said, the way the remedy was structured allows us to effectively compete on both price and packaging, day one. And so, the news just came out on Friday. So, I think, now, the states are in a position where they have to objectively analyze and evaluate the remedy. And our hope is that they will look at it with a different perspective.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason Bazinet","I heard you on the $10 billion number not changing, but my questions is pretty simple. If you have a pile of cash, either from cash flow or new funding, how, based on the MVNO terms that you got from T-Mobile and the sort of the cost to deploy your own network in the selected cities, how should we think about the use of that cash? In other words, will you toggle most of your cash towards getting more gross additions and running it on this MVNO, will you toggle all of it for standing up a network and we really shouldn\u2019t expect a bunch of incremental gross additions on a wireless side coming in, or is there some sort of balance between those two in terms of how you see this playing out? Any color would be helpful. Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","It\u2019s the latter, it will be balanced because we plan to aggressively grow the Boost business as well as begin building out the 5G network as soon as possible. In fact, an RFI and an RFP was released today by DISH regarding the 5G network. It\u2019s a very cloud-centric approach, it embraces the mentality of virtualization from the ground up. And so, we believe that the CapEx and OpEx that we\u2019ll get to in a cloud-native 5G standalone network will be very attractive. However, in the meantime, we have every motivation to grow the Boost base. And we not only want to expand the Boost distribution, because removing -- one of the conditions of closing is that we have to be able to provision new subs on T-Mobile's network. So, we\u2019re not going to provision any new Boost customers on the Sprint network. And since the T-Mobile network is far superior to the Sprint network, particularly in terms of coverage, it opens up new geographically diverse markets for us. So, we can not only work with the Boost current distribution to expand their footprint, but we\u2019ll also be able to use the current DISH distribution and retail presence throughout the country because you're going to be able to make the service available in a much broader geographic footprint.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson","Charlie, I was hoping if you could talk about your go to market strategy or vision. I sort of thought you were thinking about wholesaling capacity on DISH as you build out a 5G network, now you're squarely in retail and talking about gain into postpaid, sort of as quickly as possible. So, as you transition to your own sort of cloud-based efficient 5G network with all the capacity that you have, are you -- just curious how you plan to differentiate the service and go to market. Then, I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","Charlie Ergen","So, Doug, one of the nice things about a virtualized network with the architecture that we\u2019re using, it\u2019s completely different than the incumbent legacy networks. So, we\u2019ll slice our network in any number of ways. You might look at it as if one of the slice -- one of the big slices of our network will be our own retail business to consumers to compete against the incumbents. Right? And we didn't know whether we\u2019d be able to do that on a very timely basis. But, now, we know that we can. In fact, we know that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to enter the marketplace.","Having said that, when you look at DISH\u2019s wireless portfolios and now at approximately 14 megahertz of 800 megahertz, we\u2019re well over 100 megahertz of spectrum that we\u2019re able to utilize. And with that -- and obviously more downlink than uplink. So, we actually have more downlink, low and mid band spectrum and Verizon is example and I think they have over 120 million customers on their network. And in a 5G virtualized architecture that might only take 30% -- to put on 20 million customers for where they are today, that might only take 30% of your network -- of our network. So, we think we can do both, which is we still, in this particular thing, we have the ability to lease out 35% of our network. We\u2019re going to probably use about the same amount, if we get 120 million subscribers, and I'm sure all of you in this call believe that we\u2019re going to get 120 million subscribers. And we still have room for where 5G really needs to go, whether it\u2019d be precision agriculture or healthcare, robotics or smart cities or smart grid, or Blockchain, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, all those things still need a network. So, I think we're in a very good position to put our network where it\u2019s best used, and we have a lot of flexibility in doing that. But, certainly, the end result is we have plenty of spectrum for -- to go into consumer business and still do some of the things in a network that\u2019s architected where other incumbents are going to have a tougher time to get there.","Doug Mitchelson","I think, last quarter, you talked about it being difficult to raise financing given the uncertainty on the FCC side in terms of protecting licenses on an IoT network build out, and that uncertainty is now off the table. Do you think it's going to be easier to have these financing conversations now that there's certainty around what the business plan is and the FCC strategy around your spectrum licenses?","Charlie Ergen","I think, there is no question that -- the elimination of the uncertainty at the FCC is big, but it\u2019s equally as big we can enter the marketplace in the short period of time, we start to gain return our investment and actually start cash from the business. So, look, the markets are open, you guys are on the business -- a good business plan can raise money almost anytime, but times are good for raising money. And we don't have a good business plan, we\u2019re going to have a great business plan.","Operator","Our next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations filing and getting this done. Once the deal closes, the new company is basically going to be a holding company that has a video distribution business and a wireless services business. And I'm curious to hear your thoughts on whether you think there is operating synergy between them, or if the intent is going to be to start having separate operating structures, separate capital structures and maybe even separate ownership structures to the point where you could consider spinning out or selling the DDS business? Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","I\u2019ll take a shot at it. I don\u2019t know if Erik or Paul, you want to jump in here. But, look, we have a lot of flexibility in our structure. Obviously, it\u2019s certainly going to be enhanced as we get to satellite assets, we need to run our DBS business over into DISH. But, the plan is not to duplicate with a completely new sandbox where we have customer service. We have call centers today. There is no reason to have different call centers, different for wireless and Boost that we do for our video business. We just have to do different training. We already build -- we already understand security, we already have -- we have sales and marketing, we have distribution, we have an in home service with trucks, can go in and do things in home in terms of smart homes and connectivity and delivery of products. So, we\u2019ve got an awful lot of infrastructure in place. And Boost is a really, really similar business to ours. They use independent retailers, we started with independent retailers, we\u2019re still with independent retailers for a big part of our business. It is a customer-facing product that there's billing and collection to capital money each month. Probably the biggest differences that we get to sell something that the cost of goods sold is not going up but it\u2019s going down. And people using more, not less.","So, in TV business, people are watching some of the channels less but those channels want more money. That's not -- we're the first company to talk about that in the conference call, and we\u2019re probably three years ahead of anybody else talking about it. And people finally caught up to that notion.","But in this case, we\u2019re selling something people are using more but the cost is going down. And as we build our own network, the cost goes down materially. Do you want to comment, maybe Erik, to fill the gaps there? ","Erik Carlson","I\u2019m not sure there is a lot of gaps to fill in there, Charlie. I think, obviously, there is a business over the past 20 odd years that we\u2019ve built for certain number of capabilities. Just like Charlie said, with independent distribution or marketing or digital assets or being able to go to somebody's home, being able to provide security, understand procurement, et cetera that will continue to leverage, like we leverage for Sling that we\u2019ll continue to leverage for the wireless business.","Charlie Ergen","So, we're going to be in a lower overhead situation than perhaps Boost was within spring as an example, even though they would already. We will do better than that.","Brett Feldman","Go it. If you don\u2019t mind a follow-up because it has been a topic of discussion on prior calls about the merits of considering a combination with your largest satellite TV peer. It sounds like because you do see synergy between the video business and the wireless business, does that mean that you're not maybe interested in that anymore or it\u2019s just the bar is higher because you\u2019d actually have dissynergies if you decided to consider something strategic?","Charlie Ergen","I would say it\u2019s little bit simpler. We just don\u2019t have a relationship with AT&T. ","Operator","We will take our next question from Philip Cusick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","Philip Cusick","One for Charlie and one for Erik, if I can. Understanding that the designated entities aren\u2019t part of this deal, Charlie, do you think we can expect some movement from the FCC around those? And then second, Erik, I see this is the first quarter of satellite gross add growth in five years. What changed in the business to drive that, and did that have something to do with the AT&T promotional roll off or is that all internal? Thanks.","Erik Carlson","Yes, Phil. I\u2019ll start off and then I will let Charlie handle the DE question. Look, we've been talking on the calls for good many years now about kind of our focused effort on really doing what it takes to acquire profitable customers that we think will be with us long-term that are in the right areas and really providing superior service, technology and value. And I think this Q2 is probably the first quarter where you\u2019ve seen that all come together. Obviously, as we talked last year, there was some overhang on the business with both Univision and HBO. And really that overhang is now gone. So, you are kind of seeing Q2 as -- let's call it, a cleaner quarter without channel removals. And so kind of the fruits of our labor and the discipline, the focus that we\u2019ve had over the past few years has come to fruition.","We -- obviously, you\u2019ve mentioned AT&T and maybe they are going through something similar that we went through many years ago. I can tell you know all that -- our profitability and our credit scores, our new customers are near all-time highs. And so, we feel really good about the customers that we are attracting, both from a geographic perspective and a credit quality perspective.","Charlie Ergen","And I might just add that Game of Thrones, I think the largest viewing that HBO ever had, we still were able to -- Erik and his team kudos, because they were able to get through that. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good news for HBO but that certainly was a headwind during the quarter.","On the DEs, Des didn\u2019t -- as you know is restricted preceding, so it did not come as part of this transaction. Having said that, I think, now that the FCC and DISH are aligned, both totally aligned to do 5G mobile broadband, I would hope that one of the things that is disappointing and look, good arguments on both sides of this issue. But, the fact is that some spectrum is lying fallow that nobody can do anything about, yet until this is resolved -- and at this point, it\u2019s on the FCC\u2019s court, not in ours. I think it\u2019s been six or seven, eight months since we have responded. So, I\u2019m hopeful that ultimately between the FCC and in addition the DEs that we can get everything moving in the right direction. But, no guarantees with that, but we\u2019re certainly able to drive.","Philip Cusick","Erik, if I can follow up. Was any of the -- or any substantial portion of the customers you came back this quarter more like a returns after some of the Hispanic issues have been cleaned up?","Erik Carlson","I wouldn\u2019t necessarily categorize that way, Phil. I mean, obviously, we're making good progress now with our partnership with Univision and think we can get back to grow in that business. But, I wouldn't overemphasize your point there.","Operator","We will take our next question from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kannan Venkateshwar","So, I guess, Charlie, one question on the MVNO agreement. You mentioned the ability to license 35% of the capacity in your own network. But, the language around the ability to do so using the MVNO agreement was less clear. So, if you could just clarify if there is any ability that you have near-term to use some of the capacity that you\u2019re getting to license that to potential third parties. The second question, I guess, is more from the perspective of the states. Obviously, there has been pushbacks there. And one of the issues that seems to have come up is DISH is not in the wireless business, and therefore is it a incredible fourth player. So, is there any conversation with the states in terms of what they want from a DISH perspective rather than a T-Mobile, Sprint prospective? Thank you.","Charlie Ergen","Yes. So, on the MVNO deal, the MVNO deal is to DISH and the brand is the DISH brand and DISH will -- I think you should look at us similar to Netflix, where Netflix has a lot of forms of distribution that -- I think Amazon sells, when cable sells, and DISH sells, and Direct TV sales them. So, there is a lot of forms of distribution, but the fact of matter is you\u2019re getting your bill from Netflix and they control the consumer relationship. So, we don't have any restrictions on how we market, as long as it\u2019s a DISH product. But, we -- it would be unlikely that we could sell capacity to some -- to third-party on the T-Mobile network, that wouldn\u2019t make any sense.","Having said that, the beauty is that as we build our own network out and realize we're going to have both postpaid, build our own core within the next year, within a year closing, we're also going to build our first cities pretty quickly. Since we build our city, when you're in our city, you're in our network. But, as soon as you leave our city, the interconnect agreement is really a first-of-a-kind in the United States, as far as I can tell. But, as you go outside of our footprint, you would seamlessly roam onto the T-Mobile network and in fact, you won\u2019t even drop your session on your phone call. So, that's unique and has been done, and we\u2019re excited about the help, the justice and play the role there.","And obviously, when we have our own network that we can do, obviously there is nothing to prevent us from long-term from doing MVNO deals with other people and so forth as we build our own network. So, we have a lot of incentives to build our network. I think, it would be -- and not the least of which are severe penalties, if we don't. But regardless of that we're going to build this network out. And it's really hard for people who haven't studied the wireless business on the inside, haven\u2019t studied to degree that this company has and to understand -- you read about 5G and everything you get is what incumbents say about 5G and how they are going to do 5G. But the reality is that 5G can do so much more and just as important as the 5G technology is the architecture and how you build the network.","And so, all the incumbents have built networks that were primarily designed for voice, and were built, designed, architected in the 80s. But this is 2019 and we don't want yesterday's network. And architectures today that everybody wants to get to are open architectures where you\u2019re not relying on just one equipment supplier that equipment becomes off-the-shelf where it\u2019s interchangeable, and the majority of your network works on software, which allows you to do -- your network to do so many more things at lower cost. And so, we have the ability to do that. I mean, I\u2019m probably bad at analogies here, but you can imagine these guys are building internal combustion engine and we\u2019re building electric cars, except we\u2019re not in a situation -- our electric cars are going to be half priced, they\u2019re going to be 50% cheaper than the cars they are building. And better yet, you don't have to plug it in to charge it. It\u2019s just going to be charged because we did the software. So, you don\u2019t have to plug it in. So, you\u2019d imagine if somebody was building electric car today that was superior in every way, went faster, more robust, better user features, costs half as much money and you didn't have to wait in line to fill it up, that\u2019s what we're going to have. And the other guys who are going to get there -- the other guys have to tear their networks down and they\u2019ve got rebuild them.","So just long-winded answer, but some of the people have talked about whether we\u2019d have a hosting agreement. Hosting agreement doesn\u2019t make sense for us because a hosting agreement means we would have internal combustion cars, they would host our spectrum and we would look like just they would look like. So, customers have one to four choices, they all look pretty much the same, they all make a phone call, they'll surf the web, they're all pretty much the same. But our network and our phones will be different because we architect it. We could take advantage of massive MIMOs, our tower placement is different than incumbents\u2019 tower placement. We get to use things like [indiscernible] our cable structuring and protocol is different. It means that we do things, that big shed you see at the bottom of the towers today, that\u2019s going to be in the cloud. So, all that\u2019s different. And if all that\u2019s different, we get the best of both worlds, which is we get to use the old, as long as we need to but we get to build the new. And someday when we get chance to show the economics of that that\u2019s powerful, that\u2019s powerful. And our build out will be where the towers are used, where more people are using data. That\u2019s when we're going to build our first.","And so, we get to build out very highly efficient deployed towers. And longer-term, we will build out the more rural areas where you\u2019re middle of Montana driving down the road, and you and the cows out there, not a lot of people using that tower but we\u2019ll get to use that tower until we need to build it out which we well, but we get to defer that CapEx or OpEx. So, it\u2019s a very good economic model for us and we will be very competitive.","Erik Carlson","I\u2019ll make a couple of follow-up points. One, the agreement, as Charlie said, does not allow us to wholesale the capacity, nobody really expected that would be the case. However, we do have flexibility in creating new brands onto the network -- as I said earlier, we intend to continue to grow the Boost brand in presence, but we do have the capability to create new brands as well as bundle that with third-party products and cross market with third-party partners. So, we do have newer avenues of growth beyond that.","The second point I\u2019d make is while we're starting with attractive economics on the MVNO deal, there is also a mechanism in the agreement that enables those costs to drop at specific periods of time. But at the end of the day, it's always going to be more cost effective for us to be our own network. So, the incentive to build around where the traffic and capacities being consumed today, goes up every month.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you. And if you could just help the question on the states and the lawsuit there?","Charlie Ergen","I didn\u2019t get the question. Could you repeat?","Kannan Venkateshwar","The question was mainly about any conversation with the states around the credibility of DISH as a fourth player, and any solution they might need in order to get to\u2026","Charlie Ergen","This is Charlie. I\u2019m insulted when somebody says the credibility. When you're talking about a company in 19 -- I can remember, in 1991, when we first saw digital compression and we started building our satellites then. And we saw digital compression lab and we said we think digital compression is going is work, that\u2019s the new architecture of how video is going to be delivered. Everybody in cable, everybody in broadcast, everybody in -- that was the so called expert, every analyst said digital compression can't work. Trust me, I was there, right. Now, by 1994 -- \u201893 the same people, the exact same people said, oh! Yes, we always knew digital compression could work because directly we started to use that. And of course, the cable companies took 10 or 12 years to upgrade their plan equipment to digital because they were analog. So, here we with 5G, 5G architecture. The people want to know that nowhere this has gone; they're not discounting what DISH is saying. And by the way, DISH became the third largest MVNO, so DISH just wasn\u2019t -- DISH bigger than Cox, DISH became bigger than Charge, DISH became bigger than Time Warner, DISH became bigger than -- what was the name of the company in New York before it was Altice? DISH became bigger than Cablevision. Right? We didn\u2019t become bigger than Comcast or DirecTV. So, we\u2019ve still got a room to go.","But I can remember -- thank God, Benny Goodman was around because our first money was 12.875 with warrants for $400 million. We didn\u2019t have any money. We never built a satellite. We never built a set-top box. We never interfaced with customers, never taken a call, never built an uplink center, never done encryption in our life, and yet we\u2019re able to do all that. Right? And this project is certainly challenging, but we have so much more infrastructure in place and the ability - and we know what we're up against. It\u2019s not our first road yet. And I think we\u2019ll be a competitive threat in this business.","Erik Carlson","And regarding discussions with the states, obviously, that is confidential and not something we can discuss.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.","Ric Prentiss","Obviously, an interesting complicated settlement, good to get it this far. Really intrigued by the option to acquire decommission Sprint locations and retail stores. How many do you think might those towers be in the right place that you were just referring to? And how soon could you actually start using locations and stores how complicated would it be to help your plan?","Charlie Ergen","Well, I think -- thanks for the question. I think T-Mo indicated on their call that their Sprint T-Mo transition is likely to be in the two to three-year time frame. But, there are notification periods in the agreement that where they have to give us adequate notice of which towers will be decommissioned in what time frame. So, we\u2019ll have enough time from our own RF planning efforts to determine which towers would fit into the right footprint at the right time. But, that being said, we\u2019ll have our own independent relationships with each of the tower companies. Some towers may have assignable leases. But if they're not assignable, we will have an agreement with the tower company, we\u2019ll know where the RAD center\u2019s being vacated. And so that's important for us as we apply that to our -- the RF plan that we\u2019ll have in place at the time.","As for stores, it\u2019s similar. We will look at opportunistically where the locations are relative to where we have strengths or hold. And again, not all the leases will be assignable but we get first look.","Erik Carlson","I mean, that effect is going to be a positive. We probably don't know the scale of that, but certainly will help us in our build out and in our retail presence.","Ric Prentiss","And then, Charlie, you mentioned on the narrowband you would kind of redeploy your efforts in the short-term. I noticed in the language, the FCC's said it's been told to LLOED [ph] as far as the timeline for the March 2020 deadline. Would we think that you should be starting that like almost a main event because obviously you don\u2019t want to keep throwing up looking at your narrowband IoT network. But, how fast could you actually stop that effort and redirect it?","Charlie Ergen","I\u2019m going to stop throwing up yesterday. But, it is told -- and just to be clear, it\u2019s told when and if the FCC approves the merger, then it will be told day for day. And obviously the extent it was going to be a trial or some, we have plenty of time to -- we have time to start back up. But, it\u2019s probably one of the things I\u2019m personally most excited about. I was never -- narrowband IT, never we get great experience. We put up a lot of towers. We know how to buy a plan in the network. We know how to get permit. We know how to get zoning. We know how to climb towers. We know how to provision. So, those are all things we probably wouldn\u2019t have known, and now we just have to expand the scale of that. So, it\u2019s really, really, good education for us. But it\u2019s not -- I agree with the FCC and some of the commissioners, it wasn\u2019t the network to be proud of, compared to what we could do, compared to what the country needs. And now, we get to build that.","Again, my soapbox is, there is only one other country, there is only one other country that\u2019s building the standalone 5G network and that's China. And the only company in United States that\u2019s doing it is [technical difficulty]. And if we want to lead in 5G, if this country wants to lead in 5G, DISH is very, very important to that effort. And I think not that I would say anything nice about T-Mobile, but they also with the acquisition of Sprint will be in a position to decommission the Sprint network and build it back as 5G. So, what the FCC and justice have done is have taken, Sprint who was challenged to build a 5G network and enhanced Sprint -- T-Mobile\u2019s ability to build a 5G network in a shorter period of time because they get available capacity to do it, as they decommission the network and they brought a new entrant that can build the new architecture, the more modern way to build a network, so that we -- and net of that is that obviously T-Mo -- I mean, AT&T and Verizon are doing wonderful things in 5G. So, with their own build out, this country is going to be the envy of the world, and this transaction has got a lot to do with.","Ric Prentiss","Any update on the ESS, PSS closing timeframe?","Erik Carlson","No. We're still waiting some regulatory approvals from outside the U.S., and it\u2019s probably a couple of months out.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Craig Moffett","A couple of questions, if I could, Charlie. First, I just want to be clear. How confident are you that the eSIM strategy that you described really does enable operationally the full make versus buy transition from the two networks, just given that it\u2019s obviously -- it hasn\u2019t been possible to do any field testing of that yet? Second, are we just thinking of someone like Rakuten as possibly the best analogy to what it is you plan to build. And I wonder if you could just talk about what some of the similarities and the differences are between your network and a network like that. And then, finally, just a technical question, just with the financing of the $1.4 billion, which is the first payment, if you could just talk about where and how that will be financed?","Charlie Ergen","And the last on, we\u2019ve we already answered, we indicated that the $1.4 billion would be paid off of cash on hand.","Craig Moffett","From cash on hand. Okay, thanks\u2026","Charlie Ergen","I think, it\u2019s possible that we would be opportunistic to raise capital but we do have the cash to close the transaction on hand, and pay our debt payment in September, I think Paul I said. On the Rakuten is really building a 4G virtualized network and they\u2019ve taken -- their going pretty far with virtualization. We will go farther.","Erik Carlson","They have a path to 5G.","Charlie Ergen","And they have a path to 5G, but there are lot of similarities. For example, they also have an MVNO deal. So, their initial build out is few cities in Japan. So, they\u2019re not building the whole country once.","Erik Carlson","Their nationwide MVNO with KDDI.","Charlie Ergen","Yes. So, they have some of the similar benefits that we have. I think that -- and we\u2019re fortunate because they are blazing the path. I mean, they\u2019re obviously -- it's a difficult engineering challenge for the first company to do it and we're going to benefit as are others, by learning the lessons from them. But, they have -- one of the really cool things, we a lot of American manufacturers involved in the Rakuten thing. So, you\u2019ve got the Cisco, this is all public, Cisco and Intel and Altiostar and others, Red Hat. There's a lot of American vendors. And what I think is really exciting about it is, we don't have American hardware providers today in the existing networks, in terms of radios and things. We get a chance to do that in the future with that. So, I think Rakuten is a good one to watch. I think it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s a good company to watch. And I forgot the other point.","Erik Carlson","eSIM.","Charlie Ergen","Oh, eSIM, in this particular transaction, both us and T-Mobile have to support eSIM. There are a few restrictions, if you are financing a handset. But, you can imagine that we like eSIM because you when you don\u2019t have many customers, it\u2019s that easier when a customer can port their phone number and their hardware, without going into a store or physically putting something in the in the phone, it\u2019s little. Obviously, customers will -- you have to be really good, you have to be good on customer service and customers can switch much more easily. So, if you don\u2019t have a lot of customers, that's an advantage. You get a lot of customers, as you know from the marketplace, the incumbents who are not in favor of eSIM and they have not been supportive of it. So, that\u2019s something in this merger that\u2019s probably overlooked and that is -- look, my prediction will be that eSIM will be standard in several years in this country from all the major players, based on this deal.","Craig Moffett","But to be clear, Charlie, your ability to transition customers from one network to the other is not dependent on the eSIM workaround, it\u2019s instead embedded in the MVNO agreement that you have with T-Mobile?","Charlie Ergen","That\u2019s true.","Craig Moffett","Thank you. That helps clarify it. I appreciate that.","Charlie Ergen","Yes. It\u2019s more of a convenience for consumers. It also can be a convince for people like Apple that have eSIM in their watch and tablet. There is going to be bunch of other effects,. maybe we don\u2019t know all the effects but it\u2019s going to be positive, but consumer is going to be positive for people that use a network that relies on eSIM.","Tom Cullen","And just to clarify some of the perceptions around the MVNO, we start as an MVNO and have a path to pretty quickly get to an infrastructure MVNO, which then provides a guide path to being a standalone mobile network operator. And the infrastructure MVNO is once we implement our converged core, which would likely be mid 2020, then will be able to provision eSIM -- I mean, I'm sorry, SIMs on our facilities, which also allows us to route traffic through our core and will have all the customer and subscriber information on our equipment, not in a traditional MVNO. The MVNO is dependent on the host network to do those types of things. And as a result, they don't get any visibility into traffic analytics and being able to set their own policies and so forth.","So, that's an important distinction of this versus a typical MVNO. And clearly, as we start rolling out the RAN network it becomes more and more important. It also allows because we\u2019re using a things they call the N26 interface that when we\u2019re moving -- a customer would be moving from our network, our boundary on to the T-Mobile network, it would seamlessly transfer the call, because the two cores are interconnected.","Operator","We will take our next question from John Hodulik with UBS.","John Hodulik","Great. Maybe for some more detail on the $10 billion spend. Should we should think of the spending, as -- or the sort of timing of the spending as sort of ratable with the coverage targets, or is there some more upfront spend, Tom, as you were talking about the sort of getting the converged core up and running by 2020? And then, clarification, is that $10 billion the CapEx number, or does it include operating losses or working capital investment we may see in the wireless business? That\u2019s number one.","And then, number two, just a general question on wireless pricing. Can you -- you talked about adding Boost subs pretty aggressively. Does the MVNO in your mind give you the ability to be disruptive in terms of the prepaid or postpaid market out of the gate, but before you\u2019ve got any infrastructure up and running? And then, again, maybe for Tom, any rough numbers? You talked about the cost advantage that you are going to have with this virtualized network, as you bring up each of these markets. Can you give us a sense on what the magnitude of the cost advantage you expect to have over sort of current carrier networks in these areas you\u2019ve built out? Thanks.","Tom Cullen","Hi, John. I\u2019ll take a crack at some of them and then, Charlie, you might want to come in. But, yes, the CapEx is generally ratable with the expansion of coverage. As you pointed out, 11 upfront investment in core, for instance. But in on the grant scheme of things, a core is grounding area compared to the entire build. So, there will be some upfront investment but generally its ratable. As far as wireless pricing, yes, we do think we\u2019d be disruptive, day one, as I said, not only because of attractive rates but also bundling capabilities that are addressed in the deal. And rough numbers in terms of CapEx savings, we\u2019ve had discussions with Rakuten and we\u2019ve talked to every vendor you can imagine. But since the RFI and the RFP just went out today, it\u2019s a little premature to answer, but we\u2019re confident that the CapEx savings are at least 25%.","John Hodulik","And the OpEx savings, there\u2019s some OpEx savings too?","Tom Cullen","Well, obviously, OpEx will be much reduced, if you virtualize things like you see in data centers or cloud service providers today.","Charlie Ergen","But if you take the 15,000 towers that we are committed to the FCC and you took the $200,000 per tower, you get to\u2026","Tom Cullen","The historic metric.","Charlie Ergen","That\u2019s a historic metric. You\u2019d $3 billion. So, it gives you a feel for that we have a lot of flexibility in the timing. I think, the way I would look at it, John, in terms of -- we mentioned we would spend $500 million to a $1 billion in a narrow band IoT network by the end of 2020. We\u2019ve spent a lot on the narrowband IoT network. But obviously, to extent that we\u2019re able to redeploy those resources, while I think we might be at the higher end of this range, right, maybe slightly over it, I think that\u2019s still a pretty good number between now and 2020, in terms of what it will take to the core\u2026.","Tom Cullen","End of \u201820.","Charlie Ergen","End of \u201820 to the core, launch some cities and invest in Boost. And then, we expect we\u2019re going to be profitable into business once we get up and running. I'm not saying we will be day one, but want to get a legs on this -- we will be. ","John Hodulik","So, you\u2019re doing all process you\u2019re expected to -- profitable, you\u2019re expecting to sort of continue to generate positive EBITDA throughout the process?","Charlie Ergen","Again, I'm not saying that we\u2019re going to do day one because maybe we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know yet. But, based on what we\u2019re seeing from other MVNOs that do not have anything like the breadth and scale that we\u2019re going to have, we see some of them being profitable. It\u2019s not huge margins, but we think we\u2019ll be profitable. We think we\u2019ll improve on their margins, and again, some of the things there doing with video, and a lot of things that at our disposal that maybe our competition doesn\u2019t have. So, we\u2019re not going to be just the one-man band as a company.","Erik Carlson","Well, for instance, in video, as you know, we have a lot of cross channel inventory in ad avails that we can use to communicate to 12 million homes, which represents about 30 million handsets. And we have granted, there is an security cost there versus selling all of that time, but it\u2019s an easy way for us to communicate with a pretty large base.","Charlie Ergen","Yes. I mean, we\u2019ve got 30 million handset users that watches every day. And to the extent they have one of our competitors, some of them are very disappointed.","John Hodulik","Got you, okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Marci Ryvicker","Thanks. I have a couple of questions. First, I just want to confirm that the prepaid transaction has no impact on leverage, because it sounds like it does not. So, is that the case?","Charlie Ergen","It won\u2019t have any impact -- yes, it does in a direct way, which is -- we have net cash on hand, we\u2019ll have $1.4 billion of less cash. So, it has an impact on leverage, as you relate to that cash.","Marci Ryvicker","But, you\u2019re also acquiring EBITDA. So, I guess, we\u2019re trying to get where your leverage\u2026","Charlie Ergen","Yes. No, it\u2019s -- the whole transaction is going to be positive. Let me put this way. I feel safe to say, it\u2019ll be very positive, long term.","Erik Carlson","We\u2019re only few days into this and we\u2019re certainly building the models in here, but we certainly believe that that financial side that maybe some point to, in terms of our ability to fund this or raise capital or renew, that is not -- that\u2019s certainly not going to be our biggest issue. Our biggest issue is going to be blocking and tackling and execution. Planning the network, building that network in a modern way that\u2019s maybe quite a bit different than the way people have done in the past, just like digital compression was quite a bit different than analog video. That will be our biggest channel. But, we\u2019ve done it before and there\u2019s an awful lot of people that -- there\u2019s a lot of people have done a lot of similar things because most of our architecture looks more like a data center, looks more like a cloud data center than it does a wireless network. So, most of what we need to do has already been done by Amazon and Google and Facebook and Microsoft and Equinox -- not Equinox but data center companies. So, we're not breaking a lot of ground there.","Marci Ryvicker","And where will the business sit in your structure?","Erik Carlson","It will be the holding the company, Marci.","Marci Ryvicker","Okay. And then, the last question I have unrelated. Is there anything that you can say on the Arpson [ph] deal? We know you dropped the 22 Fox networks. Is the REIT or minimum guarantees or something else?","Warren Schlichting","Marci, hey. This is Warren Schlichting. I don\u2019t know how detail we\u2019ll get. But, look, we offered a 30-day extension and we have tried incredibly hard. And frankly, I think, we said it in the past, the model is broken. We\u2019ve got real data, we\u2019ve got real viewership, and it's an expensive gamut for us. So, frankly, I and my team have made a recommendation to the Chairman. Now, we don\u2019t know exactly how the Chairman might react to that. But, that\u2019s just not a good deal. So, the recommendation is actually to leave those RSNs off service long term.","Charlie Ergen","The frustrating thing is they are not very good economic deals for us, I mean, our customers are a little bit more rural; on the Sling slide, they are younger, they don\u2019t watch as much as sports. We have yes on Sling, we don\u2019t have yes on linear TV. So, we have real data that tells us that the channels are priced and Fox has a lot of leverage to get people to overpay when they own them. So, that\u2019s the nature of the beast. Having said that, the new owner Sinclair, we think is a company we want to do business with. We like a lot of what Sinclair is doing with the ATSC 3.0 and culturally I think we're pretty well aligned with them. So, we hate to be in a position to not be able to carry a product that they are investing a large sum of money in. ","So, that\u2019s why the Chairman is having a tough time with this one. So, I'm probably going to take this to our Board this week. And because I'm emotionally involved, I want to keep them. And my nose tells me, that's not the right thing to do. But once you take something down, a month from now, we won\u2019t have anybody that wants a regional sports network. And to put it back up, when you\u2019ve lost the customers that want it, makes no sense, makes no sense. And all you\u2019re doing is taxing the customers, you don't watch it. We clearly will lose some customers, but it's a very small fraction of our customers that are avid viewers of the regional sports, primarily baseball. So, it's kind of now, and we will lose some customers. I hate it that we lose customers. But, I also feel really good about the fact that maybe the vast majority of our customers can get a price break in a marketplace where it\u2019s getting more and more difficult to raise prices. So, it doesn't -- I guess, the Chairman saying it doesn't look good that the regional sports will ever be on DISH again.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Ben Swinburne","Charlie, just a couple of questions following up on some of your wireless comments or Tom. When you guys think about the opportunity in front of you, you\u2019ve paid $20 billion for the spectrum, you\u2019ve got another $10 billion, as you mentioned, plus this acquisition. Is the bigger opportunity long-term in sort of the retail business to build out a DISH brand in wireless business or is it more significant as a wholesaler? You\u2019ve talked a lot in the past about all the tech companies that depend on conductivity and that was a pretty compelling message. And now you've got seemingly a path to build something pretty unique. Just wondering if you look at those two options and you can even throw the cable companies in the mix, long-term, which one of those do you as a bigger opportunity for you?","And secondly, I noticed you guys hired a new CTO, I think about 10 days ago, it was a background from Jio. I was wondering if -- may pronounce the name wrong, Kannan is going to be running the wireless network build out. If there\u2019s more sort of executive hiring you plan at the top on this business?","Tom Cullen","Hey Ben, this is Tom. So, I\u2019ll answer the first one, which Charlie already mentioned earlier. So, I\u2019m not sure if you were on through the whole call. But, we still envision the breadth of our spectrum being deployed in a wholesale manner, based on 5G virtualization. But, you can see that one of those significant slices will be committed to retail, so envision it like DISH bought one of the slices and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll support Boost and the Boost growth in retail, and as I said potentially other brands. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s still isn\u2019t other capacity that can be wholesaled as we\u2019ve talked about for the past couple of years, and that could be many different verticals as well as 5G enterprise applications. So, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re meaningfully exclusive and we\u2019ll pursue both. As for Kannan, the new CTO, he is hired to replace the CTO that left the DISH network operation. And he happens to have wireless experience but he\u2019s going to be primarily focused on the DISH operations but we value his experience and look forward to bringing him on board.","Ben Swinburne","Got it. And just on the satellite business. You guys have talked for a long time as you just did on the Fox RSN that sort of once you take the pain of letting a channel go dark, it\u2019s now worth bringing them back. So, I was surprised Univision came back. I think it was off for like nine months and you guys took a hit on the subscriber front. Maybe you could talk about your thought process in terms of bringing that programming back on?","Charlie Ergen","This is Charlie. That was painful for both companies. But believe, the deal they could have had and the deal they got were different. So, it\u2019s economics for us and it\u2019s not -- so it\u2019s -- I mean, regional sports might come out at a fraction of the cost down the road but that\u2019s not going to be very attractive for anybody. And obviously people have MSNs and things like that in the industry. So, Univision was unique. It was kind of same situation, Univision was unique that the management changed. So, it took the new management -- the old management, there\u2019s a reason why the old management went there, because they didn\u2019t value DISH as a customer and tried to charge us more money than anybody else, which is -- I mean not the same, I'm talking about more money than anybody else, which probably -- which is not a good idea. And here, we are -- the problem Fox Sports is that -- Sinclair, but they\u2019re still under the Disney umbrella and I think Disney\u2019s got -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they have independent -- they\u2019ve somebody else to negotiate. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re negotiating directly with them.","So, it would have been logical just to extend the contract till Sinclair owned the asset. And then, based on the overall relationship we have with Sinclair, particularly with retrans and some other things with Sinclair, and we\u2019re trying to do together that there probably was a basis for a deal that works for everybody. But, if you\u2019re not going to extend the contract, you want to extend the contract long term at poor rates at the beginning of the baseball season next year, that\u2019s not -- I'm from Tennessee, but I\u2019m just not that stupid. And we\u2019re not going to do that. So, I have this -- I expect people to be logical but they\u2019re not always logical. And the top ten not so smart things that I\u2019ve seen since I\u2019ve been in business, Fox not extending the regional sports contract is one of the top ten, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. But, we also know that we\u2019re not in their shoes and we may be missing something. And we don\u2019t know contractually what they have and we don\u2019t know contractually what they can and can\u2019t do. So, we may be missing something. But it doesn\u2019t make any sense for us. But, we got a Board meeting later this week, and we\u2019ll make a final decision.","Operator, we\u2019ll take one more from analyst community before moving on to the press.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will begin the media portion of this call after we take our final analyst question. Our final analyst question is from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Chaplin","Thanks. Since I'm last, I'm just going to rattle off a few quick ones. So, first of all, Charlie, I'm curious why you went for 800 megahertz and not a big chunk of the 2.5? Was 2.5 something the T-Mobile wasn\u2019t willing to give up? And then, is the deal that you got at the moment the best deal you think you'll get or is there an opportunity for you guys to get more value as T-Mobile goes in to negotiate with the states and in court? And then, probably the 15,000 sites, does not equate to 50% of pops or 70% of pops? Thank you.","Charlie Ergen","We negotiated deal with T-Mobile that we thought would be very competitive for us. It then went to DoJ, and I think with the pressure from the state, that deal got actually materially better for us on a lot of fronts. So, kudos to the Department of Justice, but also to the threat from the states. That got a lot better. And I don't know what's going to happen with the states. That\u2019s up to T-Mobile and Sprint as to whether they make further concessions, and if they make further concessions, it might be the people other than DISH. So, the 15,000 towers probably come pretty close to 70%, depending on where you put them and depending on the frequencies used probably comes pretty close to 70% of the population.","Erik Carlson","But until we get a link budget in RF plan, we can\u2019t finalize that.","Charlie Ergen","But, we expect that we\u2019re obviously going to build out as fast as we can so. So, if the FCC has got some good guardrails for us in terms of goalpost to where we need to get to, so we know, where the floor is, but it really depends on the economics as we grow and as we move forward. I would say just Jonathan -- and you by the way, congratulations, you are an analyst that has picked up on some things that maybe some others haven't in your model. As you know, our cost goes way down when use owner economics. But every Fortune 500 company, every Board of Directors either has or will, ask their management to have a 5G strategy. And if you are going to have a 5G strategy, then you\u2019re going to have to understand what a network really can do. And there will be a lot of companies that can help companies with the 5G strategy. The one company will be in everybody's list is going to be DISH. And we're not going to do things for everybody but we're going to work with the companies that have a vision, the same vision that we do, and want to move in the same direction that we do, or we get educated and we should go in a different direction.","The 800 megahertz, well, 2.5, least and it was a bit complicated, and of course we knew it pretty well because we tried to buy Clearwater [ph] and then Sprint six years ago. So, it was something that we looked at different buckets, the 800 for us, given that we believe we\u2019re going to build macro towers from the outside in and that we believe additional frequencies will come on the market on CBRS or C-band or some other frequencies, we might build inside out. We don't like the longer-term play for us was better there.","Jonathan Chaplin","Thanks very much, guys, and congratulations.","Charlie Ergen","Thanks. Okay, operator, we will move to media.","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first media question comes from Scott Moritz with Bloomberg. Please go ahead. ","Scott Moritz","On financing, Charlie, are you open to selling any of your spectrum at this point?","Charlie Ergen","We prefer not. In fact, we have some restrictions on -- potentially restrictions, although it needs the FCC approval. So, it depends on what the spectrum was. I mean, if you looked at our portfolio that we believe we need to spectrum that we have to be competitive. Right. It is not to say, there is not a piece here or there, but we believe we need that spectrum.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Erik Carlson","No. Thank you for your time and interest. We will be in touch.","Operator","Thank you.

Afterwards, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded, Wednesday, February 22, 2017.","I would now like to turn the call over to Jason Kiser, Treasurer. Please go ahead.","Jason Kiser - DISH Network Corp.","Great. Thank you. Thanks for joining us everybody. This is Jason Kiser, Treasurer here at DISH Network. I'm joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman and CEO; Tom Cullen, EVP of Corporate Development; Roger Lynch, CEO of Sling TV; Erik Carlson, President of DISH Network; Steve Swain, our CFO; Paul Orban, our Controller; and Stan Dodge, our General Counsel.","Before we open it up for Q&A, we do need to do our Safe Harbor disclosures.

We ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in your report. We also do not allow audio-taping and ask that you respect that.","All statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from historical results and from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

And our first question comes from the line of Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Charlie, two \u2013 one a long shot, I guess. First on the auction, one small company, U.S. Cellular, has reported how much it committed for the auction. Stan's warning notwithstanding, can you talk it all about what you've committed?","And then would it be more likely on the DBS side, churned down nicely, can we think of this year as more normal versus the last couple where you were raising credit requirements and cutting back on credits? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","The answer to the first question is no, we cannot comment. The second question is on DBS churn, again, I think we've said this a lot of times, but the churn you have today is what you did last year and the year before that, so it's always a lagging indicator by probably 12 months or so. In that sense, yes, I think that maybe, Erik, you want to talk about some of the things you're doing. But I think we certainly are more disciplined geographically and credit-wise on the linear side of the business and have been and maybe you want to speak to what you're doing now, Erik.","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, I think that's right, Charlie. So this is Erik. I mean, I think we've been more disciplined both on the front end from a credit requirement from customers, and as Charlie alluded, geography-based. Obviously, there's more competition where there's densified broadband, and that leads us to \u2013 on the DBS side of the business to look for areas where there's less competition and where our investments can, obviously, be more profitable for a longer period of time.","So, both of those things have been many in place for the latter half of 2016. And as Charlie alluded to, I mean, we've also definitely improved on our willingness to give credits to customers to buy down price points. So one of the things we did last year, obviously, with Flex Pack is to introduce a package, which helps us both on the retention and the acquisition front and provides options for customers that only need to buy programming that they watch. And where that benefits us, really, is a bit on the margin side and not having to buy down customer price points, so we can right-size customers with that Flex Pack.","So I think all of those \u2013 those things have been in place in 2016. You're starting to see some of those effects with our churn rate, and then obviously there's some effect on new acquisition by \u2013 I mean, by not bringing on customers that we'll lose money on. Obviously, we \u2013 and focusing only on geography where we think we can be successful long-term. I mean, obviously, that shrinks the market a little bit on the DBS side.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Erik, can you give us an idea of what share of your existing customer base is in those areas where you feel like you can be competitive long-term?","W. Erik Carlson - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, so I don't think we go into that level of detail. But just broad brush, I mean, obviously, we're focused more on \u2013 especially having the Sling product, right, we focus on areas where there's not dense broadband, as I said. And obviously, our Sling product obviously is great for those areas where there is a high-speed broadband. And obviously, Roger can touch on that in a minute if you'd like.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. And just sticking with the video trends, obviously you had a pretty good result in Pay-TV net adds this quarter relative to expectations. And churn obviously played a role in that on the DBS side. I was hoping you could maybe give us a little more color on the trends you're seeing in Sling TV, and I'm particularly interested in whether that trend line was affected at all by the launch of DIRECTV NOW later in the quarter. Thanks.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, hi, this is Roger, Brett. So DIRECTV NOW launched at the end of November. And my take on what we saw is an expansion of the OTT market by their entry. So we didn't see through the quarter any change in the momentum that we had on Sling TV including in the month of December after they launched. We know that they added a lot of subscribers in that month. So our hope, we've been expecting more competition for quite a while for Sling TV, and our expectation has been that as new entrants enter the market, the market just expands faster, which is typically what you see in early-stage markets like this.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","If I could just ask a follow-up question, I'm curious to your thoughts on the importance of the merits of bundling Sling with network access because that's obviously one of the points that AT&T makes with DIRECTV NOW, especially now that the FCC has effectively endorsed zero rating?","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Well, AT&T put a lot behind their bundling of DIRECTV NOW with their wireless service and zero rating their DIRECTV NOW service, but the market seems to have moved since then where everyone's gone to unlimited data, which, from a Sling perspective, is good news because while the vast, vast majority of viewership of Sling is on TVs in the home, there's a lot of access that people use their cell phones for, and including the way we acquire subscribers. And so, zero rating, unlimited data, I think is quite good overall for Sling.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. And this is Charlie. Just in a bigger picture response to your question, I mean, I think the linear television, traditional trends, I think, still continue to be down. I don't think that that is going to change in the future.","And the OTT trends are up. And I think those are just general trends that have been going on for two or three years. And I think the question will be just whether they \u2013 they really haven't accelerated in a material way, but at some point perhaps they will, particularly as more people come into the OTT market.","And I think the other piece of it is that Roger and his team and Erik and his team working with programmers to the extent that programmers \u2013 that's the decline of linear TV will probably be in part be driven by how programmers react if they continue to raise prices, continue to have 16 to 18 minutes of advertising an hour, and you can go to an OTT world that's a little bit more consumer-friendly and there's better economics in digital advertising in an OTT world, then the acceleration will increase.","But there's other things that could be done that would maybe stem that tide. So I think it's a bit \u2013 we're not the biggest player in the industry, but I think we have a very good feel for where the trend lines are, and we think there are certainly things you could do to beef up linear TV, if the programmers are willing to do that. And to the extent that they're not, the OTT probably trend will accelerate.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk of BTIG. Please proceed with your question.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Hi. Thanks. It's actually Rich Greenfield solo this call. Walt would have joined, but he's stuck in an English pub somewhere in Epcot Center, I think purely to spite me on my Disney short thesis. But in all seriousness, Charlie, I just wanted to expand on that last point that you just made vis-\u00e0-vis the shift to OTT, and what could actually be done by the programmers to actually improve \u2013 like what are you talking about, what types of things should programmers be thinking about? And I'm particularly interested in kind of a follow-up on Sling, for the first time ever you're going to have your programmers in direct competition with you. It sounds like any day now, or any week now, you're going to have Hulu launching. And your programming partners who you pay are now going to be competing directly against you. And I'm just wondering how you think that impacts your relationship on the programming partner side?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Let me take the second part first. We already have, to some degree, programming partners competing with us certainly on the premium side, that already exists. And of course, I don't view that as a positive for people in the distribution business.","And certainly, Hulu will have a dramatic impact on Roger's business, Sling, we would expect. But obviously it's going to grow the market, too. So we just have to be prepared for that competition, that we will see how good we are as a team as we faced increased competition on that side.","On the linear side, I think you've got to make linear TV look more like an OTT product. I think there's simple things if you talk to people who \u2013 I think there are simple things where people like \u2013 one of the reasons that people I talk to like Netflix is you can watch commercial-free, and you can binge view. And that's kind of hard to do on linear TV today, but technically it would be relatively easy to duplicate some of that. So, and people like linear TV, having a hard drive in their home, and having more access to it.","There's a lot of positives about what linear TV can do. So I think you just have to give programmers who are willing to do those kind of things, to the extent that programmers also are in Hulu they may be less inclined to do it. So we'll just have to wait-and-see. Our job is to go with our content partners and say here's how we jointly can make our business better. And it's a long process, and each company moves at a different pace, and each has a different strategy, and each is in a different strategic position.","But I do think that we can at least at DISH Network I think that we can make our linear product more consumer-friendly and make it look a little bit more like the things people expect to take some of the benefits of OTT and incorporate it in linear, but we have to have willing partners to do that. And then, whether they want to do that and we technically can do it. Let's put it that way. Anything, you want to add \u2013 I mean, Roger, anything on the Sling side from the competition?","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","I think \u2013 yeah \u2013 I think \u2013 look, there's a lot of rumored launches coming this year. Hulu is probably one of the biggest ones. And I would expect that they'll do a good job with their launch. And that will have an impact on our market share, certainly just like I'm sure DIRECTV NOW had an impact on our market share. Then the question is how quickly will the market grow? And, as I mentioned with that earlier question, what we saw in December looked to me like the market grew at least as fast as DIRECTV had its subs because we didn't see an impact on our activations through December. But at some point, there'll be enough competitors that they'll outpace the growth of market.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","And, Roger, it sounds like you've expanded what the definition of Sling TV's mission is. I mean, when you started, it sounded like really focused on Millennials. I remember the original launch at CES, it was all about going after kind of the cord-nevers or the cord-cutters. And it seems like now you're really expanding to go after any household in America that wants lower cost video. Are you seeing a shift in where your gross adds are coming from, meaning coming from traditional Pay-TV, cable\/satellite versus from literally new adds, meaning people that have never had cable before?","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","You're right, Rich. When we first launched, our focus was people who had already cut the cord or Millennials cord-nevers. That was in part because, we had \u2013 our launch service was a dozen channels, right, for $20. No locals. It was a pretty slimmed-down content offer and also we knew that or we expected that what we'd be going after are early adopters which tend to be young males and we had strong sports focus so that sort of fit that demo pretty well.","Since then, we've added a lot of content. We have over 100 channels now. We have locals in many of the major markets. And so we are able to attract a much broader audience than we were able to in the beginning. Plus, we're starting to get past at least the early phase of early adopters and able to attract people who are more comfortable switching to something like this now.","So we're seeing a broadening in our demographic. It's not quite as male as it used to be. It's \u2013 we're getting people of all age groups. I got a letter from an 85-year-old the other day who's a customer of Sling. And I think we will continue to see that. And I think Netflix sort of helps plow the road for us on that front by bringing more and more people who are less technically inclined into the market for a service like this.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Rich, this is Charlie. I think we're getting kind of dragged into that. Because, I mean, obviously, the DIRECTV NOW product was directly \u2013 is directly a cable or satellite TV replacement. I mean, it's almost identical of programming packages and tiers.","So, Sony is very similar to that as well. So the rest of the industry is going that way. I mean, I think we'll get \u2013 we've gotten dragged into that, and it's \u2013 maybe it wouldn't be my first preference for how it will go, but I think it's probably inevitable. So it's probably more of a timing issue. But I think that OTT today is becoming a direct replacement for cable and satellite.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Thank you very much. That's really helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant of Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Charlie, just a question about the recent transaction with EchoStar. I mean the logic behind moving back the set-top box business and the uplink business and giving up the broadband business. And given what the multiples are for those businesses, in my opinion, there was an implicit value for Sling there for that 10%. Can you help us understand sort of what kind of valuation that that is what you thought is worth on that transaction? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Vijay, I don't know that I can answer the valuation question. I can tell you that the logic of why we did, why we realigned \u2013 we swapped assets. It was almost 10 years ago when we split the companies apart. We had a logic to why we're doing it. We had a theory on where we thought the market was going to go. Some of those theories didn't turn out to be exactly right. For example, we thought that the set-top box business, from an EchoStar perspective, we could go out and get \u2013 as a separate company, we could go out and get other people in the industry, cable industry and other parts of the world. And we just really weren't that successful.","And now with OTT proliferation and video becoming more of an app, the set-top box business is not nearly \u2013 in terms of set-top box, we just don't see as good a long-term future in that side of the business. And at the same time, DISH became very dependent on EchoStar for core services whether it'd be uplink services, backhaul for local channels, technology, and it made more \u2013 and then it made more sense for DISH to be in control of their own destiny for those assets.","And then on the flipside of it, EchoStar, with acquisition of Hughes and the success that Hughes has shown was becoming more of a \u2013 they really are unique and the ability to build and launch high throughput satellites with all the technology that goes around that, there weren't really \u2013 there's really only a few companies that do that in the world today. And they're now able to focus their resources on the satellite and high throughput and broadband satellite side of the business which we think is a growing worldwide \u2013 they think is a growing worldwide business. So really it just aligns the resources to where they want to be I think.","I think there's a secondary benefit. If you look at \u2013 you also can look out there and say, there's probably going to be M&A activity out there in the future, and may perhaps the administration is more attuned to that. And this probably aligns the assets in a better way to participate potentially in that as well.","Vijay Jayant - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Since it is the end of the year, could you so kindly provide us with the Sling net sub numbers?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","No.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just kidding. Okay. A couple other questions. SAC has been declining and we're getting about $536 per gross add in the fourth quarter. In the 10-K, you say that this should continue to remain low. Is it going to remain this low, any thoughts on that?","And then secondly, for cash taxes, it looks like the cash tax rate was 25% in 2016. Is this something we should think about going forward?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","On the SAC, I mean, I'd say that SAC for Sling is very low, and SAC for DISH is probably still in the historical range that's been, but when you \u2013 but given that there's some momentum within Sling, that's the primary driver to bring it down. And so, I think a lot depends on the ratio between Sling and DISH. But if it's on the current trend, it's probably in that range. I'll let \u2013 Steve, you should take the tax question, or Paul, one of the two.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, sure, Marci. Yes, cash taxes were up year-over-year, over $400 million. The increase in cash taxes in 2016 was due to an increase in DISH's pre-tax earnings relative to 2015 and a sizable taxable gain that we recognized related to DISH's derivative positions. In 2017, without a realizable taxable gain on derivatives, and of course, we're not factoring in any potential impact of the current auction because we can't comment on that. We do expect to pay less cash tax in 2017.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then any thoughts on how potential tax reform could impact you?","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","So in the long-term, we think that DISH will probably benefit, like most businesses, with tax reform. Historically, though, our cash tax rate has been lower than the statutory rate. So the impact of a lower corporate tax rate may not have as big of an impact to DISH, cash taxes in the short-term. But, of course, the new tax policy has yet to be passed. So we really can't speculate on the impact to DISH.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Two, if I could. One, you mentioned how the asset exchange is kind of aligning and you're having self-control. As you think about some of the other satellite services you receive from EchoStar, there's a couple of satellites that are coming up on the end of either the useful life or the termination date. Any thoughts of what we should be expecting in those costs either OpEx or CapEx?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I think typically the \u2013 I would say typically we leased those pretty much to the end of the useful life. But I don't \u2013 I think \u2013 I don't know whether some of those satellites are actually pretty close to end of life, which means we probably wouldn't extend their life. But if they have life, we typically utilize those.","We do have a satellite launch scheduled. There is a satellite launch scheduled later this year (23:55) capacity that may give us some flexibility. But I think that's an EchoStar-owned satellite again (24:00).","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","So I didn't answer your question. I really don't know.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Yes. If you look at our 10-K, we have one satellite that is the leased ends and...","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","September 2017.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","What was that? 12?","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","September of 2017, is that the one?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yes.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Yes. And we likely, given the orbital slot that's in, we likely will not renew that lease.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And that's probably because it's close to end of life.","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","And it is close to end of life, yes.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then on your spectrum, can you update us kind of on build plans, or how are you doing as far as getting spectrum into the ecosystem of handsets or infrastructure?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I think that we talked about it in the last shift (24:52) thing. There's going to be a really a fundamental shift in wireless technology with 5G, and you're reading a lot about it. Because it brings lower latency, a lot faster throughput, enables Internet of Things, in particular narrowband Internet of Things for massive Internet connectivity.","So we see that it makes logical sense for us to build a network not like the current incumbents have but with utilizing the new technology. So in other words, we can build a network that's completely an IP network, take advantage of all the 5G technologies and also take advantage of the virtualization of the core, for example, so that, well, the smarts are in the cloud instead of being on the tower. So there's a lot of \u2013 which means you're building \u2013 as a matter of fact, as your build-out cost is a lot less and your OpEx is a lot less, and you have a modern network that has much more capacity than networks do today.","So that's what we're focused on. It would be logical for us to \u2013 there's a couple different elections we could make in terms of build-out. There's either an interim, which is really coming up next month, or you can go for an accelerated build-out, elect the accelerated build-out where in our case would be really a March of 2020 build-out, and that would be a likely choice for us to choose accelerated build-out for 2020.","We haven't been standing still. So we have done a lot in preparation. Obviously, in 3GPP, you have to get your spectrum in bands that are (sic) 3GPP authorized, which we've done with Band 29, 66 and 70. So most of our spectrum now is in licensed band. You have to do things like carrier aggregation and make sure you get different combinations where you can aggregate your spectrum, and we've done a lot of that. We still have a little bit more of that to do.","We now have \u2013 or have sent our RFIs on the technology that we think we would utilize and are evaluating that. We have mostly Congress coming up. We could see everything in the world in the next couple weeks. And so, we've done some testing both on the broadcast side for 700 MHz and on fixed wireless.","So we feel pretty good about it. I think there's probably always going to be some kind of skepticism, but it's not our first rodeo. It reminds me a lot of how we first entered the satellite television business where we decided in 1992 that we're going to build satellites. And then by 1995, we were launching those satellites \u2013 we launched our first satellite and we were able to cover the whole country and utilize our license. It was a complex three-year build of the satellite with complications with the Chinese launch, and we had to build uplink centers and connectivity around the country and build a dealer network and build encryption and set-top box and so forth. So, all those things had to kind of come together.","My experience has been that those things go a lot smoother when you spend a fair amount of your time planning and not just doing things and then changing things. So I think we spend a lot of time planning, and we feel like we're in pretty good shape to go out and have a network that can take advantage of it. One of the things we're waiting on, of course, is the anti-collusion period. It's been kind of off and on for the last three years. And there are other people who have to build out networks for different reasons and there's probably some opportunity to partner when the anti-collusion period is up, which we hope will be up in the next six or seven weeks.","We, obviously, want to see the results of the 600 megahertz auction and that we also want to see the results of our partners in AWS-3 spectrum with their litigation as to whether they are going to receive the discount or not in the AWS-3 auction. So all those things we think are going to come together in the next couple of months. And then I think we'll communicate both \u2013 we're going to be communicating both to the FCC and to the Street as to exactly what we're going to be doing.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That helps a lot. Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","So, obviously, we feel comfortable that we can have a very state-of-the-art network, and we think it can be built for materially less than current networks were built for.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet of Citi. Please proceed.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just have a question for Mr. Ergen, which is maybe a smidgen personal. But, hopefully you can answer it. So I think you're in your early 60s, and I've just never asked you this. I just don't have a sense of sort of how much energy and vigor you have to sort of go take on something new like 5G. Do you mind just sharing with us a bit about sort of how you're thinking about your work plans over the next, call it, five or 10 years?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. I mean \u2013 I guess I can kind of answer that. I mean, I think that any time you can get new challenges, you can get pretty invigorated. I don't think that I'm going to be \u2013 I think that my role is a bit more of a coach than a player or a bit more of a General Manager maybe than a coach. So I don't \u2013 and so I think we've built a good team around here to go out and execute on some of the opportunities that we see out there.","But 5G is particularly exciting to me, particularly the Internet of Things, because when you start thinking about \u2013 and so any time you're passionate about something, I think you just have \u2013 you have a different set of energy. I mean, I'm pretty impressed with our President who's 70, who is a bit older than I am and seems to have more energy than people might have been younger than him in the past. So I think it really depends on if you have the passion or not.","And the Internet of Things is so interesting because, A, the fact is that billions of devices are going to be connected, and it's machines or microprocessors or automobiles, it's the healthcare, it's industrials, agricultures, entertainment, whether it be virtual reality, augmented reality, municipal, utilities, all those things are going to be connected with the new technologies.","And somebody is going to lead the way. And it reminds me a lot of \u2013 it reminds me to some degree of the advent of the Internet. And it's going to be that \u2013 and we can play \u2013 we have the core ingredient for the Internet of Things, which is spectrum and the ability to connect things, both inside and outside the home. So I'm excited about that and about what we can do as a company.","And I think we can make \u2013 look, I don't know that we're going to make a big difference on how you make a phone call, but I think we can make a big difference in how you connect things. And part of our strategy has been, in past auctions, is we look at \u2013 the FCC always sets the pricing based on population. But in past auctions, we've always, maybe, thought that was shortsighted in the sense that we really look at auctions as the ability to connect to microprocessors and machines and things.","And when you do that, you're not talking about 3 million population in the Denver area, you're maybe talking about 1 billion population of things you connect to, and that gives you a different focus on how you might approach those things.","It's very similar to how we think spectrum is a bit asynchronous, and we're probably one of the first people to think about it that way. So we just think about the network a different way, and that's pretty exciting because we can make a difference there. And we can make a difference in productivity. We can make a difference in people's lives. So, while you hopefully make a profit, you're also increasing productivity in the United States in a number of ways. So that was a long-winded answer.","Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","We hope you make a profit and maybe increase productivity, but thank you.","Operator","We will now take our final question from the analyst community. We will begin the media portion of this call following the answer to this final analyst question. Our final analyst question comes from the line of Tom Eagan of Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Yeah, great, thanks. Just a follow-up on two points. First, Charlie, could you give us some kind of estimate on what you think the cost of the network build could be? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Because we're still going through all our quotes and things, it would be probably be premature to do that. But it is materially \u2013 and obviously, you would build a network in phases, so \u2013 but it would be materially less than networks that have been on build in the past. I mean you definitely can do things in 5G and with the virtual network that you just can't do in the past. And the Internet of Things, particularly in narrowband of Internet of Things, you can get much deeper coverage from a single tower site, so you in theory would need less tower sites. And those savings can be material. So, certainly we'll share with the Street as we get a bit more detail around that. But we're not that far away from that by the way in terms of how we're going to build out.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Okay, thanks. And then for Roger...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Some of it could be that the \u2013 again, the other part of is where you can build out with a partner, for example, they're going up \u2013 I mean, T-Mobile has talked about building out 600 megahertz next year to the extent that they're going up to a tower and you can attach some of your product at the same time you both can share in the savings. AWS-3 \u2013 AT&T is talking about building AWS-3 and WCS, and Verizon is talking about AWS-3. And there is FirstNet build that's going to happen. So, there's going to be a lot of build, Fegato's (35:35) got to build and increase their network. So, there's a lot of people out there that will be building, and there's probably an opportunity to save in partnership with \u2013 where both parties reduce costs. That part we probably won't have as much visibility to the short-term.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Yeah. And then for Roger, we've seen surprising success with individual networks launching OTT services, like at CBS. Should we see more of those individual channel OTT services, does that pose more risk to Sling, or do you think that that fragmentation is more of a benefit for Sling? Thanks.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","The way I think about that is that a decade ago, five years ago, you got a bundle of channels from your Pay-TV operator, and that was really your only choice. Buy the big bundle of channels, get to watch everything.","And the launch of Netflix streaming in combination with the growth of OTA, use of antennas, has created an alternative. And then you layer on these, sort of, direct-to-consumer services that are launching and the way I think about bundles today is everybody creates their own individual bundle. You don't go to one company \u2013 and I'm talking mostly about Millennials right now, but obviously, as they age up, we'll see this permeate of the age groups as people put together their own bundle.","So, they may take an antenna and Netflix and Sling, we see that combination over and over and over again. And then they may add on some other direct-to-consumer service that program has had. And that really \u2013 I think that insight from the beginning is what has driven our strategy.","So our strategy has never been just to replicate that big bundle of channels because we don't think that's really where consumers are going. Our strategy is to tap into the growth markets of broadband-only homes, use of antennas, people who want more \u00e0 la carte-like experience with TVs.","So, if you look at our packaging, we have a low base price, and then you add the genre mix that you want on top of that. So we're trying to tap into that, what I see as a growing segment of people who are creating their own bundles, and I think services like what CBS is doing sort of taps into that same mindset.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take questions from members of the media. Our first media question comes from the line of Scott Moritz of Bloomberg. Please proceed.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Hey. Great. Thanks. Charlie, back in the \u2013 kind of the LTE early days, you had a vision for building kind of the mobile video network that would compete just with the other carriers but also perhaps cable. Now that 5G is in your sights, how has your vision changed, if at all?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","It hasn't changed that much. I think there's a couple things going on. One of the things that 5G does with mobile video is it allows you to \u2013 it's going to allow you to use \u2013 and correct me if I'm wrong, Tom, because I'm not always the most technical person, but it allows you to use all of your bandwidth within in what's called eMBMS broadcasting, so you can use all of your bandwidth in a broadcast mode. When we're looking at \u2013 in 4G, I think we were only able to use 60% of the bandwidth within the broadcast mode. So the 5G will make it incrementally more efficient. I think you also have to look and see \u2013 we'll also have to look and see what happens with ATS-3 and broadcasters, so we do think there's some synergy potentially with broadcasters themselves as the 3.0 ATSCs comes out. You want to add something to that, Tom? I'm sure I bungled that.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","No. From a strategy standpoint, we still believe wireless and video are clearly converging. And when we started talking about that five years ago, it wasn't as evident as it is now.","We've had some changes when we agreed to lower the power level on the E-block that changed some, what we were able to do with the 700 MHz E. But as Charlie said, when you move to 5G, the capacity is going to be so much greater that it will enable new use cases beyond just streaming video.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And I think, one of the things I think that's not really understood maybe by people is that a lot of what Roger does, the original vision of Sling was not a consumer product, it was to get the video in the cloud so it was prepared for a wireless network.","But Roger said, well, if we're going to do that, we might \u2013 there's probably a business in selling that, if we can get the programmers to \u2013 onboard to take a look at the new way of monetizing their assets.","And so, Sling became actually a product as a result of a strategy to make wireless available for \u2013 video available for wireless. But the actual start of that was to get the video in the cloud to prepare for wireless.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Great. And if I could just follow, you mentioned that you could build a 5G network more cheaply than prior networks have been built. Where do you get the cost savings in that network build?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I mean, there's a number of areas. And again, I'm probably not the most technical person. But certainly, the network would be all IP. So you're not carrying around 2G and Edge and switch networks technology that makes everything much more complex, as an example.","The second thing is you're able to use a core. You can put a much simpler radio on the tower because the smarts are all in the cloud because the connectivity to the cloud is much better now. Most towers have fiber back to the cloud, and then you can do kind of a hub and spoke things. AT&T is probably the leader in that today, but they've got to redo their whole network, whereas we can start from that from scratch.","And finally, some of the technical features of 5G particularly IoT features allow you to potentially propagate and get much, much greater depth of coverage off of a single tower. And that's material. And so it reduces the number of towers that you might need, you want to \u2013 so. But those are just any number of things that \u2013 those are probably highlights, but there's other things that would allow you to build a network much less expensively.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anjali Athavaley of Reuters. Please proceed.","Anjali Athavaley - Reuters News Agency","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. We had a report recently that Sprint's owners would be interested in pursuing a deal with T-Mobile after the spectrum auction is over. And I wondered if you had any thoughts on how further consolidation in wireless might affect how you'll be looking at M&A this year?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I think there's always been the thought within the wireless industry, the consolidation may make sense. There's a lot of capital CapEx to build networks. And what extent you can share that either through M&A or share that in another way, any time you can reduce costs from a company perspective that makes some sense. What that effect is on consumers and competition, of course, is a different question.","So I personally think that because people really haven't been able to have discussions over the last three years, number one. And number two, that you have a change in administration that potentially may be more favorable to M&A, that there certainly will be a lot of \u2013 there'll probably be a lot more rumor than fact. But I'm sure there will be discussions among any number of parties that are in the wireless business today and people who maybe are not in the wireless business today.","And, I would imagine that \u2013 we're not the biggest company, we're not going to drive that process, but obviously, many of the assets that we hold could be involved in that mix.","Anjali Athavaley - Reuters News Agency","Got it.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Shalini Ramachandran of Wall Street Journal. Please proceed.","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal","Hey, Charlie. I wanted to ask a couple of questions. One, how do you think the new administration, I just want to get a bit more color from you about how it will affect DISH's ability to get into the wireless business and participate in M&A, specifically since the new Chairman, Ajit Pai, was quite a vocal critic of DISH during the whole discount saga.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I mean, I think that \u2013 I mean, I don't know how the new administration will be as it relates to DISH. I mean, I think that because they are \u2013 and I think \u2013 and Chairman Pai was critical of the discounts that the DEs received in the auction. But again, I think we just have an honest disagreement on that because we feel like they followed the rules, and that's now for an independent party to decide. And, obviously we live with the decisions one way or the other.","But the current Chairman is certainly pro-consumer. I think he's pro-competition and I think that bodes well for the things that we're doing at DISH, because that's a very similar attitude that we have. And I think that he will be \u2013 I think he'll be aggressive to bring new spectrum to the market, new features, and new services for consumers. So I think that bodes well for us because that's exactly what we want to do.","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal","Got you. And one other follow-up, I guess, to the previous question. Just given the 2020 build-out deadline, and I guess I understand the way that you are talking about maybe building out with more inexpensive technologies than what was previously used. But do you feel like you have to do any kind of M&A deal with a wireless carrier in order to meet that deadline, or is there an organic way to build out with those inexpensive technologies you mentioned and by partnering like you said instead? Like, is there a plan B if M&A doesn't work out?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. No, I think that we can organically \u2013 I think our baseline is that we organically will meet \u2013 it's only a small portion of our spectrum that we have in 2020, some is 2024, and some is 2028 or something. But we will have an organic \u2013 our focus has been on organic build-out for the 2020 timeframe. And obviously, even without M&A, I think as others build out, there's opportunities to do some joint things together and save both company's money. And obviously, your prediction is as good as mine as to where M&A goes in the industry other that we're not the guys that are going to drive that. Somebody else is going to drive that train.","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Shields of Bloomberg. Please proceed with your question.","Todd Shields - Bloomberg LP","Hi, Charlie, Todd Shields with Bloomberg News in Washington. Interested in the airwaves that do face the build-out deadline for next month, people have been talking about whether you sell or build those airwaves basically or lease them out some way. So today you're definitively saying you're building for sure, and you're not going to sell those airwaves or lease them out, the AW4s? Thank you. AWS-4s, sorry.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I'm definitively saying that we believe that we have a plan to build out our \u2013 the part of the spectrum that's due in 2020, that's what \u2013 we certainly have that as a focus. Obviously, things \u2013 as people \u2013 as technology changes and events change and, to the extent, that there's events that happen in the industry, obviously, things could change. Right? But we certainly believe we can control our own destiny.","Todd Shields - Bloomberg LP","Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","That we're not \u2013 we do not need to do an M&A transaction to meet the build-out schedule.","Todd Shields - Bloomberg LP","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Farrell of Multichannel News. Please proceed.","Mike Farrell - Multichannel News","Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I just had a quick thing about Viacom and their plans to kind of focus on six core networks. I'm just wondering what you guys are thinking about that. Is this kind of a precursor to maybe that the bundle finally gets broken up? I mean, how do you think this is going to kind of affect you guys and just programming, in general, going forward?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","This is Charlie. I think it's smart. I think that's a reasonable strategy. I think that there are probably too many channels out there today and there are channels that we know are lightly viewed that consumers have to pay for. And with the advent of competition from Netflix and Amazon and Apple and other people who are now in the programming business, I think that it's \u2013 I think what Viacom is doing is wise.","I don't think \u2013 I think there's still value in some of their other channels, and I don't think they're giving up on those channels. I just think they just \u2013 I think just think they're going where the eyeballs are going, and I think that's a reasonable strategy, and I think we'll probably see other content providers focus on fewer channels but make them better. Because if they don't, they're going to get eaten up by the new entrants into the production business.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Operator, I think we have time for one more call \u2013 question from the press.","Operator","Okay, very well. And our last question comes from the line of Jimmy Schaeffler of The Carmel Group. Please proceed.","Jimmy Schaeffler - The Carmel Group","Hey, good morning. My question is for Charlie and for Tom. Fixed wireless and unlicensed spectrum plans have been announced of late by the likes of Windstream and Verizon and AT&T and Charter and Google. Could you provide DISH's thoughts about unlicensed spectrum in fixed wireless today?","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Hey, Jimmy, this is Tom. There was quite a bit of fanfare around 28-gig a year ago this month. And I saw recently that now there's a number of trials to be deployed later this year. We think it's promising, but a little early to predict where it comes out. And it incidentally is part of the EchoStar transaction that we announced earlier in the month. We will pick up 28-gigahertz that they have licenses for in four markets in the U.S. So it will give us an opportunity to test with 28-gigahertz as well.","And then we think in the long run bringing more spectrum to the market will serve the public interest. And related to that, we have the 12.2 to 12.7 gigahertz 500 megahertz of spectrum that has to be coordinated with DBS, but we think there's a path to bring that to market in a two-way fashion. And we have implemented some filings with the FCC under the previous administration to move that forward into a rulemaking process. And we're hopeful that will proceed under the current administration.","Jimmy Schaeffler - The Carmel Group","Okay. And just one quick follow-up. Thanks, Tom. For Charlie, security, when you look at a satellite, is it better down the road in terms of protecting people's security because of fewer parts in the pipe?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I don't know that I'd say it that way, Jimmy, because once you get down from the satellite, you start getting into the infrastructure. So I think that \u2013 I mean, I think security is a core resource that we have at DISH. I mean, we know a bit about it. And as an example, whether it be your home security system or whether it be video secure or whether it be a network with Internet of Things, security \u2013 people are going to want different varying levels of security. Some cases perhaps a vending machine reporting in that they're out of Coke. People may not care about security, but you're certainly going to care about your camera on your front door being secure.","So \u2013 and you're certainly going to care about your utility meter being secure. And you're going to care about your health information being secure. So it's just one more thing that we think we have a core competency in, and it will be part of what we do in the future.","Jimmy Schaeffler - The Carmel Group","Thank you.","Thomas A.

Clayton","Thanks, Stanton, and good afternoon for those of you on the East Coast and good morning to our West Coast participants. I'll focus my remarks today on our commercial and operational performance in the third quarter. As Robert said earlier, Charlie and Tom Cullen are also here to take your questions on our spectrum status a little later.","First, Blockbuster. Last week, we announced the DISH would close its remaining domestic stores, headquarters operations and by-mail service in early January. We also reported that our wholly-owned Blockbuster Mexico subsidiary is held for sale. Now it is a fact that the American consumer today is receiving his or her content electronically as opposed to physically and the original Blockbuster business model was predicated primarily on the physical distribution of video. Now DISH will retain all of our licensing rights to the Blockbuster brand as well as other key digital assets, including the company's significant video library and digital technology. We continue to see value in the brand as we expand our digital offerings. Our Blockbuster @Home streaming movie service is a good example.","The third quarter also saw the expansion of several of our commercial activities. Our Apple iPad offer with the Hopper is the ultimate consumer bundle for both in-home and out-of-home viewing. And the Southwest DISH promotion provides us with a direct traveler linkage to our Hopper with Sling product. Both of these marketing programs attract high-value potential customers, affluent, frequent travelers and those likely to own a mobile device. Our Hopper product today offers the buying public simply the best viewing experience.","We also had several victories on the legal front as we continue to fight back the broadcasters' attempts to stifle technological innovation in terms of our PrimeTime Anytime, AutoHop and DISH Anywhere features. Again, the board's standdown [ph] on the side of the consumers' rights of choice and control.","Now let's move on to the third quarter numbers. As is typical of a mature industry, we face fierce competitive pricing pressures and aggressive promotions. Despite the headwinds, we gained 35,000 new net subscribers in our satellite pay-TV business. Now that's an improvement of 54,000 compared to last year's third quarter. This takes our pay-TV customer base to nearly 14,050,000. We also celebrated the 1-year anniversary of our broadband satellite business by capturing 75,000 dishNET subscribers. This improves our customer count to slightly over 380,000.","In total, we continue to grow our base of high-value customers, increasing the percentage of activations with HD, DVR and IP connections. We are also pleased that our churn results came in at 1.66%, 1-basis-point better than our second quarter number. This was one of our better third quarter churn performances, and it came on the heels of our first quarter price increase.","Now to provide you all with additional details on our financial performance, here's our CFO, Robert Olson.","Robert E. Olson","Thank you. As Joe noted, we continued to make solid progress in growing our core businesses. Our pay-TV customer base increased by 35,000 net subscribers in the quarter. Gross activations were up sequentially due to normal seasonality and just slightly below last year. The improvement in net adds year-over-year was largely due to large churn rate, which was 14 basis points better year-over-year. We continue to make improvements in our retention efforts.","Our broadband business also experienced solid growth. Gross activations of 101,000 in the quarter were up significantly versus third quarter last year and also higher than we recorded during the first 2 quarters this year. Since many of our broadband customers are new pay-TV subscribers, our third quarter performance benefited from the seasonality in pay-TV activation. We ended the quarter with 385,000 broadband subscribers.","Subscriber-related revenue was up $199 million or 6.1% in the third quarter compared to last year. This gross growth was largely driven by pay-TV ARPU, which was up roughly $4 year-over-year. We saw a slight sequential improvement in ARPU in the third quarter due to higher pay-per-view revenue. Our broadband business accounted for $36 million of the year-over-year subscriber-related revenue increase. Subscriber-related expenses increased by 9.3% in the third quarter versus last year. Excluding the impact of our broadband business, pay-TV subscriber-related expense increased 7.9% year-over-year. This increase was largely due to higher pay-TV programming expense, primarily driven by increases in our contractual revenues [ph] .","As we announced last week, we will be shutting down the roughly 300 remaining domestic Blockbuster stores by early January. We currently estimate that we will incur future losses between $15 million and $30 million associated with the shutdown of the domestic business. We also reported that our Blockbuster operations in Mexico were deemed to be held for sale as of September 30. We took a $21 million charge in the third quarter to adjust inventory and property to their estimated fair market value less selling costs.","Pay-TV SAC for the quarter was $842 per activation, which was up $45 year-over-year, largely due to the increased take rate our Hopper receiver system. As we had forecast previously, SAC was down this quarter versus the first half of this year, primarily due to lower brand advertising expense. Due to the higher Hopper take rates, we expect SAC to remain in the mid- to upper 800s for the next several quarters.","Administrative expenses were down $83 million year-over-year in the third quarter. This reduction was a result of fewer Blockbuster domestic stores and the deconsolidation of Blockbuster U.K. business. G&A expenses for the DISH pay-TV business were roughly flat year-over-year.","Interest expense was up $46 million year-over-year, driven by an increase in long-term debt levels, but down sequentially $25 million due to the redemption of debt associated with the Sprint offer. We recognized $106 million of other income, largely due to gains associated with the sales of Sprint and Clearwire equity and gains on our derivative positions. We recognized a onetime reduction in taxes of $102 million in the third quarter. This was associated with a reserve we had established due to our DBSD purchase in March 2012. This reserve was deemed to no longer be necessary based on tax rewins we received in the quarter. There was minimal cash impact of this change in the third quarter, as the impact will be recognized over 15 years.","Net income in the third quarter was $315 million, which was up $473 million year-over-year. The year-over-year comparison is obviously impacted by the Voom settlement last year.","Free cash flow was $82 million in the third quarter. This was lower than net income due to a few onetime and seasonal factors. Gains on Sprint and Clearwire equity were investing activities, so they were not included in our definition of free cash flow. Also, seasonally high pay-TV and broadband activations drove up CapEx in the quarter.","Looking at the balance sheet compared to the second quarter, cash was up $700 million and other current assets declined by roughly the same amount. This was driven primarily by the settlement of the Sprint derivatives positions.","Let me now turn it back to Joe before we start Q&A.","Joseph P. Clayton","Thanks, Robert. Our plan remains the same: to grow high-value customers and to increase revenue while at the same time making the strategic investments for our future. Thanks for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. Now we'll open it up for your questions. We'll start with questions from the financial analysts. And when we are finished with those, we'll open the line up for questions from the media. Okay, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","First question, with churn down so much, can you talk to us about what the driver of this was? Did you have any specific promotions in the quarter? And did your retention spend go up significantly because of this?","Bernard L. Han","This is Bernie. I think there are a number of factors. First of all, when you compare to the second quarter, the biggest difference was the roll-off of the price increase impact that we saw in the second quarter. Typically, the third quarter, we'd see a bump in churn rate somewhere between 7 to 10 points. And this year, we didn't, I think, because of all the price increase. The price increase impacted us in the second quarter a little bit more than we had anticipated. When you look year-over-year, there are a few things that happened. One is we had a fairly -- even though we had a takedown in the quarter, it was relatively clean compared to last year at this time and some of the previous years in the third quarter. When it comes to third quarter promotional -- football promotions, I think we saw less of an impact this year than we did in the past several years. I think some of the customers that were more attracted to football commercial offers were kind of lost the past several years, and we lost a little bit less this year. Outside of that, it's a continuation of some improvements we've been making in the customer service and improvements we've been making in retention practices overall.","Joseph P. Clayton","And in the product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have 2 questions that are both around programming costs. Robert, can you talk a little bit about the year-over-year growth you saw this quarter? I know you were comping the AMC dispute last year, but 9% I think is higher than we've seen. What kind of organic [indiscernible] growth did you see in the quarter, and what should we expect going forward? And along those lines, maybe for Joe or Charlie, can you help us [indiscernible] just say discussions, obviously really important programming for the product that you have with Hopper lawsuit? I'm wondering how you're thinking about juggling those 2 variables as you try to move forward with Disney as a partner.","Robert E. Olson","So Ben, this is Robert. I'll take that first question on programming expense. As we -- as I noted, our subscriber-related expense was up 9.3% year-over-year. But if you exclude broadband, which is growing quite rapidly from that number, the pay-TV subscriber-related expense is up 7.9% a year. Now obviously, that's still more than we would like and largely driven by programming expenses. As you noted, AMC slightly distorts the year-over-year comparison. We had virtually no AMC programming expense in the third quarter last year. So we've talked about this before, programming expense is going to growing far faster than inflation. It's a challenge for the entire industry.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. And this is Charlie. On Disney, I mean, I think that we continue to be cautiously optimistic we'll get a deal done. We've obviously been in active negotiations for many, many months. And some of the issues are -- there's always economic issues, but there's -- but because Disney contracts tend to be long -- relatively long term in nature, I think both sides are trying to look at where the technology is going and what the world might look like in several years. And trying to craft an agreement about where the marketplace might look is difficult because for a long-term contract, we don't want to have to go back to Disney and ask permission to do something, and they don't want to come to us and ask permission if there's different forms of distribution for them. So -- and Disney, as it turns out, is one of the more -- is a little bit farther along in the technology curve. They seem to have a bit more of focus on that than many programmers today. So in that sense, they're thinking about things that maybe other programmers haven't thought about. And so that -- all those things are part of the discussion. So it's a great negotiation because it's forcing us to think about what the future looks like. And obviously, they -- it has to be a fair deal for Disney. It has to be a fair deal for our customers. And I'm again, cautiously optimistic that we'll get there, but there's not a particular time line on it. It really just has to be done right. It has to be done right kind of long term.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And the fact that you didn't mention the Hopper, should I take that as a point that that's not necessarily a deal breaker, something that's going to get in the way of a constructive agreement?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean, I think the Hopper was a bit more -- this is just my opinion, it has nothing to do with negotiations. But the Hopper -- our timing wasn't particularly great on that, but it's more of -- it was more of an emotional thing, I think, than a reality thing. Obviously, everybody's got a DVR that can skip commercials. So -- and I think the fact that what we really are trying to get broadcasters to think about is that people are going to skip commercials. Isn't there a better way? Let's recognize that fact. And if you recognize the fact that people are going to skip commercials when they play things back on a DVR, is there a better way for us to go about monetizing that, that is fair to the customer but actually monetizes that in a way for you, the broadcaster, who needs a dual income stream? So we are a big believer in the dual income stream because otherwise, broadcasters will just have to raise their rates more. But you have to understand that the world has changed. And if the world has changed, you get 2 choices. You can put your head in the sand or you can go out and try to do something about it. And The Hopper, as it turns out, has built-in technology that can target commercials to customers in a better and give the customer a better experience. And I think, this is my personal opinion, long term, will give the broadcaster more revenue. And to the extent that we have conversations, we can show that technology to people and if they have an open mind about it, I think they're going to come to that conclusion. It's not a proven concept yet. We're going to have to experiment with it. We won't get everything right to begin with, but the Hopper was designed to maintain a dual income stream for broadcasters just in a different way when you play advertising off a DVR.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line [ph] of Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions but first, just a clarification on the Disney deal. Will DISH start accruing what management anticipates to be the new Disney rate card as of October 1?","Joseph P. Clayton","Yes.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, okay. Charlie, reading the 10-Q, I just noted a number of ways EchoStar and DISH are still working together beyond just receivers. And the deeper you go into wireless and something like broadband, I'm wondering if this construct with DISH and EchoStar being separate publicly-traded companies is starting to become inefficient. Any thoughts on that?","Charles W. Ergen","I think based on -- I mean, it depends a lot on what the world looks like. But as of today, I think it's an efficient way to do things and I think that -- I mean, again, just in the basic thing, really what EchoStar does is their wholesale, they don't deal except with minor exceptional consumers. They do deal with consumers in the broadband business. But other than that, they don't deal with consumers. And their businesses is in fact focused on a lot of international opportunities. DISH, on the other hand, is very retail consumer-focused, doesn't do things internationally. And so I think there's a good split of resources. We'll see. Time will tell. There are certainly areas where DISH and EchoStar work together. There are certainly areas from a technology point of view where it makes a lot of sense for DISH to contract for that technology, whether it be from EchoStar or some other company and rather than do it ourselves, when our focus really has to be on the consumer. So far, it makes sense today. But obviously, they're both public companies and their boards could come to conclusions differently than that at some point in time. But I think from my personal perspective, it seems to be the right split.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understood. And then last question, Charlie and\/or Tom, just would be interested in hearing how you feel DISH's wireless technology has progressed since the investors last heard from you in August.","Thomas A. Cullen","Hey, Doug. This is Tom. The developments since August are probably in 2 fronts: one is the developing bankruptcy proceeding on the LightSquared spectrum, where we have been deemed the stalking horse bid since the last call. And the second is the kind of multielement negotiation that we entered into with the FCC and other industry players around the interoperability agreement. And I think most people on the call probably understand the details of that, where we agreed to lower the power limits on E-block, we got an extension on our build-out. We have an option to convert the AWS-4 to all downlink. And in exchange, in the totality of that package, once approved by the FCC, which is scheduled for approval by December 22, then we would also be agreeing to bid the reserve price of $1.56 billion in the H-block auction, which is scheduled for January 22. So those are the significant developments from the last call. And I think time will tell how each of those 2 events play out.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So 2, if I may. One on just on the potential for consolidation on the satellite space. It looks like the airline deal is progressing. Charlie, can you update us on any thoughts there? And second, on broadband. It seems like the business is accelerating the costs or ramping. Are we getting to a point where churn is starting to become material in that business? You've been in there for over a year now. And should we look for it to slow down here as churn sort of starts to catch up with you or do you think it can accelerate further?","Charles W. Ergen","First -- Phil, first on the industry and consolidation, I think Mike White, on his call, summed it up pretty well. There's obviously a business case that makes a lot of sense for consolidation in the satellite industry. I think you're going to see consolidation maybe first in the cable industry. And then obviously, you're seeing on the government's part that they do negotiate things within airline [ph] side. So it makes a lot of sense whether that ever comes to your version side [ph] of the story. But I mean, I think both DISH and DIRECT realize that, that can make a lot of sense. The broadband -- satellite broadband side of it has not been particularly profitable yet. It hasn't reached its potential yet for a bunch of reasons. But in part, the satellite broadband is a great product when people have it, but it's not an alternative to cable broadband or even, in most cases, to phone DSL. So we probably need to do a little bit better job of screening our customers and that in itself would reduce churn. And you might want to go little bit slower because not all customers are equal. And so our distribution is fairly spread out between DISH, EchoStar, ViaSat, DIRECTV, dealers, distributors, Internet providers. And so you end up with not a great system in terms of control of getting the initial customer, So we've got to do a better job of that. And I think there's some ways to make more sense of that business. And Joe and his team are certainly -- well, I mean Joe may want to comment on that. But certainly, the broadband side of the business has been a pleasant surprise from a demand point of view. But we had -- the financial side of it hasn't caught up with it yet, in part, because we're learning as we go. And I think, Joe, you might want to comment on, maybe what your plans are for that?","Joseph P. Clayton","Yes. First of all, we have to remember that this is a new business. We're still learning. I believe there's operational efficiencies in front of us from an installation standpoint. We must do a much better job at the beginning of the sales process in qualifying the customer. \"Are you in a cable-intensive market? Do have Fiber-to-the-Curb available to you?\" In our efforts to be successful, we probably weren't as stringent in terms of the qualifications when we started in this. So I fully expect us to have some improvement as we ramp up the volume and get better with our processes and procedures.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It sounds like you're sort of implementing those a little more stringent standards now, and we might see of a little bit of a slowdown before the business picks up again?","Joseph P. Clayton","A slowdown -- a reduction in churn or slowdown in the business -- in the sales. We're hoping for the latter, a reduction in the churn. The sales were a little higher in the third quarter, but that was seasonally driven. We're going to see the same seasonality, I believe, in DISH Net broadband satellite as we see in the pay-TV business today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft from Evercore.","Preeti C. Doshi - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","This is Preeti Doshi for Bryan. My question is on the promotion when the new customers receive either an iPad 2 or programming credits. First question is how has that free iPad offer performed relative to the programming credits? And then two, how much did the promotion impact SAC by this quarter?","Joseph P. Clayton","Okay. I'll try to take that. In terms of the free iPad offer, we do believe that it indeed is attracting a more creditworthy customer, higher income, higher educated. So from that standpoint, we're pleased with that. We do know from our market research that the higher category of customers most likely, who've taken the iPad, churn less and have a better customer experience because, as I said earlier in my prepared remarks, that Hopper today with a tablet provides simply the best video experience available today. So we're pleased with where it's at, and we look forward to helping our business as we move into the holiday selling season.","Robert E. Olson","This is Robert. I believe your second question was on the impact of the iPad to SAC. And just so you understand, the iPad is offered to customers as an alternative to programming discount. The iPad is part of a basically multiple-element sale, which also includes a 24-month contract for programming at retail price. We have assessed the fair market value of each component. Both the fair market value of the revenue from the iPad sale and the equipment costs are amortized over the life of the contract. So to answer your question, it really -- it didn't have an impact on SAC.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant from ISI Group.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A couple questions, please. Just you extended your buyback authorization. Can you just really talk about is that still an opportunity given your cash balance? And then more for Charlie, as you're moving forward on your wireless plans in terms of getting spectrum and probably looking for partnerships, can you sort of talk to us, in your mind, what's the business model that sort of makes the most sense on a risk-adjusted basis for you?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. First, on buyback, yes, we extended the buyback. Obviously, we look at -- again, we look at everything and as management and we hope that we can use our cash more effectively when buying back our stock. But buying back your stock is sometimes a very good way to return value to the shareholders, so we always want to have that as an option. And so we continue to do that. But I would -- it's never our -- it hasn't been our first choice of ways to use our money. And then with tax laws, dividends are less likely because a buyback would be more likely than dividend. So -- because tax laws have changed and made that less attractive. So we continue to look for ways to use the money. Historically, the last few years has been in wireless investments and spectrum investments. In terms of strategically, the -- I think we have a lot of optionality. I think what you try to do strategically is put yourself in a place where you have a lot of optionality. I think that the latest agreement with the FCC, assuming that happens and we get the ability to go with all downlink, it gives us optionality we wouldn't have had before because it frees up some impaired spectrum for us and gives us greater potential value there. Downlink spectrum is also, as you guys know, more valuable than uplink spectrum because consumers use a lot more downlink spectrum and so forth. And because our focus in wireless is, our main focus is on video, we think that's the best way for us to go. Obviously in the video side, you use most of that. Most of that is downlink spectrum. So -- and in terms of -- and we'll see where we come out, as Tom said it, next year, where we see we come out with the H-block auction and LightSquared. And I think then you're going to have kind of a pause of where the industry is until possibly the AWS-3 auction, which may be another year later or so. So when you have that pause, then I think you can look at what your optionality is. And I think that H-block auction will be over, which means you can start talking to people again. I mean, realize that you shouldn't expect a bunch of things happening in the industry for those people who participate in the H-block auction because starting when?","Joseph P. Clayton","Anti-pollution on Friday.","Charles W. Ergen","Starting this Friday? Starting this Friday, anti-pollution rules go into effect. So that has to wait then for the -- for this, for the -- into the H-block auction. So that's kind of where we are. And obviously -- I'll just repeat myself. I mean, obviously at the end of the spectrum, we could build up. We could build up the spectrum all by ourselves. Other end of the spectrum, we could just sell the -- other end of the Gulf Coast, we can sell the spectrum. Neither one of those is a high probability, but they're possible. And in between that is to partner with somebody who's already in the business. And that partnership can take any number of forms of things going forward. And so I like, strategically, to have a lot of optionality and it's easier to make good choices when you have options. And normally when you have -- if you really do your homework, events happen, the world changes in a certain way and the strategic place you should go ultimately becomes pretty obvious. The extra year to build out, that we think we're going to get from the FCC, will be very helpful, will give us a little bit more time. The technology continues to change. There's a certain point in time when you -- the way that you would do towers and the core and handsets, that technology is changing dramatically. And so you want to hit the right timing on that. And I like where we are. And it's an asset that I think continues to increase in value on our balance sheet. And I think it helps us potentially transform the company going forward because we know we're in a mature business. We know our core business is a mature business. And while Joe and his team are doing a good job of continuing that business and it doesn't have dramatic places it can go. As a stand-alone current business, it has to do some things differently to kind of take it to the next level. Just like when we were in the big DISH business, to transform the company, we had to go in the little DISH business. And now that we're in little DISH business, we're going to have to transform the company, and one way to do that is in the wireless side of the business. That's a long-winded answer that, probably, didn't say much other than I like where we are and we have optionality and we'll see how it plays out.","Operator","And your next question comes from one as Matthew Harrigan from Wunderlich Securities.","Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","I was just curious, through the discussion about Intel OnCue and various people looking at that presumably on OCC side out of market for cable. Can you talk a little bit more about your own intent in that area, since we hear a lot about that in the context of the Disney discussions?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, this is Charlie again. We're not in any discussions with Intel on their OTT OnCue product. And we talked to virtually every programmer about OTT, and it's -- I would say it's going to happen at some point in time. But I don't know whether that's a 1-month schedule or a 10-year schedule. But it's going to happen at some point in time, but most programmers have been hesitant to embrace that kind of a dramatic change. And so in the short term, it's unclear that that's going to happen. I don't know whether Intel has contracts and is ready to go or they just have -- my gut feel is they have more of a platform than they do programming rights, only because we haven't seen programming rights being issued, but it is possible that people are doing it without our knowledge. So that's kind of where it stands. But I always say sometime OTT will happen and the timing is unclear.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan from Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Over longer term, can you give us some idea on the aspirations looking at Latin America and possible entering that market in a larger way? And then with the SAC up in the near term, when do you see that levering -- leveling off? Any particular promotions that have driven the near-term impact with the Hopper on FCC?","Charles W. Ergen","I'll take the first part, Rob -- okay. In Latin America, we don't have any plans at DISH for Latin America. And to be clear, EchoStar has -- is in Mexico today and has announced plans to potentially enter Brazil with...","Robert E. Olson","So this is Robert. With regards to your SAC question, we do eventually see SAC leveling down, perhaps, even slightly declining in the future. The driver of that will be when we start remanufacturing Hoppers. Right now, we remanufacture very few because very few of those customers churn. It somewhat depends on the churn rate, which -- of the Hopper, which we think will be lower. And so when we do start remanufacturing those receivers, we'll start seeing a lower SAC.","Operator","Your next question comes from one of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Charlie, you spoke about potentially partnering with some of the telecom operators and so on. Just wanted to understand that model looks like in your mind in terms of partnering? And what are the different options available on that front for you?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, there's a lot of options. And I guess I'm probably not going to go into detail in all of them because that -- because a lot of those things are going to have -- but some optionality will increase or decrease depending on what happens with the H-block auction and LightSquared. So we'll kind of see where we are early next year. But we have the ability to sell the spectrum. We have the ability to lease spectrum. We have a build-out we need to do by 2021; all those things factor in. Most of what we will look at strategically ideally would be to enhance the current DISH business. So we've got to -- we've got 33 years in building DISH Network. It would -- it doesn't make as much sense to me personally to go out and enter a new business and not to do that in a way that would enhance what we've already done for 33 years. And so by that, I mean, that we we'd be most interested in the wireless business, we're most interested on the video side of it and less interested in the voice and data and texting kind of thing that the wireless guys all do pretty well today. And so the video side takes a lot of capacity, which we have today. So it takes a lot of downlink capacity. So you can imagine any number of scenarios on the video side where you might partner with one or more than one of the current providers going forward. And now, whether anybody in the wireless business today is interested in video is unclear. But I would be -- I mean, it makes sense. But I think -- I watch people who watch video on tablets and phones in a wireless way. If you play with Google Glasses, you're watching video on Google Glass, but you need -- how do you get the signal there if you're not in a WiFi area? So all those things kind of come into play with spectrum. And so that would ideally be the right way for us to go about it because it enhances the DISH value when we do that in addition to maybe open up another revenue opportunity for us as well on the video side. So we have to make our video ubiquitous. So that's our focus. That doesn't mean that we wouldn't do other things. But ideally, it would be video-centric.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital IQ.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","I was just trying to understand on the Blockbuster @Home service, how do you plan to monetize that going forward? And in terms of the content plans, should we assume that, that should -- that kind of plays into your programming negotiations as you kind of renew your contracts? Any kind of color on that would be helpful.","Joseph P. Clayton","Well, first of all, let's define what Blockbuster @Home is. It's a movie service of 15 linear channels and also a large number of digitally streamed movies. Think of it as an add-on service not too dissimilar than HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, Starz, of that yolk. We charge $10 a month for it. And we give it away free for 90 days when you purchase a Hopper and one of our better programming packages. So it is an important part of our programming mix. And we'll look to improve upon that service as every provider as we go forward.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Okay. Switching gears. Charlie, in your comment about the talks with Disney, I was wondering, I know you have a pending matter, the ESPN, some of the Disney channels, the HD feeds, which has been up be there for a few years now. So is that something that is -- you would view as separate? Or should I assume that, that is part of the resolution process as you kind of look to resolve all of those issues? Is that something that's part of the current negotiation?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I don't really want give to you parts of the negotiation, but I'll give you the big picture part of it, which is Disney historically has been, for me personally, not one of our best relationships. And most of that's been my fault. And if we go forward with -- we're prepared to go either way with relationship, either not have an agreement with Disney, which strategically puts us in a different direction, which I think is -- would be unique in the industry. And while it would be a short-term problem, I think long term, it could make a lot of sense. Or the alternative to that, which is what I think we're focused on, and I think Disney's -- we want to make -- we would want to make Disney our best relationship. I'm not interested in a long-term relationship with Disney unless we can go into that by making that our best relationship in programming, right? Otherwise, it doesn't make sense because I'm getting too old to do business with people that we don't have a good relationship with and -- just to make a buck. And that's the way we're approaching it, which is how do we make this the best relationship that we have in the programming side of the business? And if we do that -- if we can do that on both sides, let's move forward. And if we can't do that, both companies will do fine, and life will move on, and we just weren't compatible, right? You don't marry everybody you date -- that's it. Disney's a very pretty girl.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Okay, I understand. So it's kind of you first -- see deal where you kind of made a deal that also resolved the litigation. I guess I'm trying understand, you wouldn't make a deal unless you kind of -- it was a comprehensive scenario that resolves all outstanding matters is what I'm trying to understand.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. I would just say that I can't anticipate -- I don't anticipate if you're going to try to make some -- you're going to try to make a relationship your best relationship, I can't -- I don't know why you would want to be in court either now or in the future. And lastly, I make lots of mistakes in business. And I try to -- I just try not to continue to make stupid mistakes.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Understood. Last question, so when I look back several years, some of the best growth that DISH Network has had has been when you guys positioned yourself as a low-cost provider. And when I think about how you shift in the last few years, I think you're talking a lot about going after high-quality subs and et cetera. I'm just trying to understand if that's kind of a systematic shift in strategy of who your target customer is? And if that's the case, what's the underlying reason for that? Is that due to programming? Cost environment? Is there any other -- or maybe technology? Why this sudden shift in your strategy of who your target customer is? Or is that a function perhaps of the mature market and the promotions out there? It will be helpful.","Charles W. Ergen","Joe can take this one. But I mean -- just briefly comment. It's -- everybody -- it's interesting. Everybody talks about going after high-end customers. But there's only a minority of the people in United States are high-end customers. And so you have to be across the board. And I think the shift, really, I'm going to say historically, when Joe became the CEO, Joe made that shift because -- Joe has made somewhat of a shift because the Hopper really is the best product on the marketplace. And then you can read any independent review of the Hopper, but it's a 4-star product that continued to outrank and named best product in the world, and the European trade show, best product of the CES. And so that experience is the best. And so if that experience was the best, that's going to appeal to the higher-end customer. And so I don't know so much of a focus on high-end customers other than we have a product that's the best in the industry right now in terms of the experience that you have. And we didn't have that 2 or 3 years ago. And Joe and his team have made that the best product. And hopefully, we'll continue to keep it the best. Joe?","Joseph P. Clayton","I think it's pretty simple. In a mature market, you've got that product right. We need to sell a better mix. And the new product, the Hopper, it gives us a higher ARPU, for example. We get a better customer service experience. It's lower churn. Now we got to that because the Hopper product, we differentiated it from, I'll call it a CSA miss in terms of the other set-top boxes in the business today. Other providers, pay-TV providers, don't have PrimeTime Anytime. They do not have AutoHop. They do not -- they cannot record 6 programs at one time. They do not have something as simple as a remote control finder. And most certainly, they don't have the extensive mobility capabilities we have with DISH Anywhere. We think that's our competitive advantage. And that's why we're communicating that message to the buying public today. And it's helping move -- moving the needle in the right direction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson.","Craig Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Charlie, I wonder if we could go back to the -- your conversation about video and wireless? Can you comment a little bit about how you think about the differences between a mobility wireless network and a fixed wireless broadband network? You're doing your tests with nTelos. And intuition would say it would be cheaper to build fixed wireless broadband network or a certain nomadic network, if you will, and may serve the need better for competing within the broadband market. But everything I hear you say talks about mobility as the necessary requirement. I wonder if you could just talk about that for us?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. I may throw the fixed broadband over to Tom, but let me tell you how I think of it. We're in a fixed wireless business today, which is called broadcast from satellites, right? So we go to every streets [ph] in the United States and we send that signal out. And that same signal goes to every customer, right? So when you're watching the football game, everybody gets that signal, whether they choose to tune to that channel or not. When I look at -- so we already do that today. And we do that -- we think we do that more economical than anybody else in the United States today. So that's a really good base of business for us. But if you look in the wireless side of the business -- but the problem with that business is as soon as you go somewhere outside of your house or if you go in a room where you don't have a TV set, you can't do it by wire. You can't do it by cable. You have to ultimately have some other way to -- a means of communication. So when you go outside of your house, it means you're also going to have a video experience. And that video experience is going to change. It's going to be, in some case, broadcast, right? So our E Block capacity is very good for that. So there's -- in some case, everybody may be watching the football game. So on Sunday, everybody in Denver is going to be watching the Broncos. And then in Chicago, some people are going to be watching the Bears, okay? So you can broadcast something differently, but everybody in Denver gets the same thing. But most of where video, and where I think video is going that we're not -- where we're well-positioned with our spectrum, but we don't have a business yet, is really a unicast video, where you go to Netflix and you watch a particular movie and your wife goes and watches different movie. That becomes a unicast. And if you're somewhere outside your home or you're in the back patio, that's going to be a one-to-one relationship. And that's going to take spectrum to do it, right? And we want to make sure that you have that total experience with DISH so you can do whatever you want to. And the other piece -- reason I like that unicast business is, and I'll go back to my Hopper advertising thing, is that is going to be a unique advertising opportunity for another revenue stream for the content owners. Because now that you're watching something uniquely to you and you're watching it on a smart device. And that smart device knows who you are, it knows who you call, it knows your credit card information. It's probably a smart wallet, right? It knows where physically you are through GPS, right? It knows what you buy, right? So it's smart. And once it's smart, the advertising opportunity is really, really magnified compared to the broadcast mode that we have today. So you can imagine the content owners being able to give you a unique advertisement based on your physical location or based on your demographic in a way that they can't today. And by the way, that advertisement is also interactive. So if you wanted to purchase something or request information, you could do that while you're on your device. So when you put that whole ecosystem together, right, you're going to do what we're doing.","Thomas A. Cullen","Craig, this is Tom. To answer a little bit more on the fixed broadband side, I guess the short answer is if we're going to use the spectrum in its highest and best use in different geographic areas based on competitive broadband, as well as demand on the wireless network. So said differently, we'd be crazy to deploy fixed broadband in a large metro area where there's already Fiber-to-the-Curb or DOCSIS 3.0 or 3.1 because we simply won't be able to compete. Yet there are a lot of geographic areas in this country where there's still interior fixed terrestrial broadband, I should say, where we think there is a fixed opportunity. Again, that depends on the spectrum depth that we're ultimately able to achieve. And then in those areas, obviously, that's where there's less stress on the mobile network. And so you have the luxury of using more of your spectrum depth to support fixed broadband rather than mobility. But again, that's why we like, hopefully, achieving the optionality of having more downlink capability because in either event, more downlink will support mobile video, as well as fixed broadband because that's where the demands are. And the other -- as you know, the fact that there is no legacy equipment or technologies on the spectrum and makes this a new build or a new deployment opportunity-based technology, obviously you have to put a different lens on that spectrum when it's not occupied versus when it's already encumbered.","So operator, I think that will wrap up the financial analyst portion of the call.","Joseph P. Clayton","No more question?","Charles W. Ergen","Oh, I'm sorry. One more, Joe?","Joseph P. Clayton","Okay, one more question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our final analyst question comes from the line of Gerard Hallaren from Janco.","Gerard Hallaren - Janco Partners, Inc., Research Division","Yes. I noticed that Globalstar is out promoting ATC. and the FCC seems to be constructive about that for a conventional satellite for low-power WiFi use. Does that open anything up for you or enhance your value at all?","Charles W. Ergen","I mean -- this is Charlie. I mean, I think they are just -- I think it's good. I think in general, it's good public policy that you use spectrum in its best and most efficient manner. And Globalstar has worldwide frequency that's not particularly economic or hasn't been particularly economic just using it for satellite. And so they offer ATC to use it terrestrially as well. You can certainly do -- use it terrestrially without any frame in your satellite operations. So I think the FCC's got to analyze that. People will comment on that. But in general, my opinion is that makes a lot of sense because that puts more spectrum out there for use. That doesn't necessarily enhanced our value one way or the other, but it certainly opens up more opportunity for spectrum for people.","Joseph P. Clayton","Okay. That's concludes our Q&A portion with the financial analysts. And we thank you all for joining our call today. Now we've got some time for questions from members of the media who are on the line.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first media question comes from the line of Liana Baker from Thomson Reuters.","Liana Baker","T-Mobile just said today that they're considering buying some spectrum from a private party. Charlie or Tom, just want to confirm that's not from you guys at all. Any idea where that spectrum would come from?","Joseph P. Clayton","Yes. We just wouldn't comment on that.","Liana Baker","Got it. So another one for Charlie. I was wondering if you would ever consider doing anything in the future outside of DISH?","Charles W. Ergen","Would I personally?","Liana Baker","Yes.","Charles W. Ergen","I've never thought about it, doing anything. I mean, I barely [ph] -- I don't know what I could do. I'm barely doing a decent job here. Since I -- most people tell me how bad I'm doing.","Liana Baker","If there was anything else you could do, what might that be? Or I guess I'm just kind of asking if you could ever see yourself doing something outside satellite or wireless down the road?","Charles W. Ergen","I mean, as soon as we develop people. I mean, Joe and I both are focused on this. As soon as we develop people that can run DISH better than Joe and I, we're going to fire ourselves, right? I mean, I already fired myself as CEO. And I'm prepared to fire myself as Chairman. And then, yes, I think there's other things that Joe and I can do. And -- but they may not be business-related. It might be more philanthropic or something else. Joe may just go hunting around the world. We can rule out pro-golf in both cases.","Joseph P. Clayton","I wouldn't mind owning a distillery.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, I -- not to be -- but I think we have one big project left in us. And then I think that's something in wireless. And that's -- it's not something we thought about yesterday. We've been really focused on it for 5 or 6 years now. And I think we can do -- we can make better wireless experiences for customers. And I think we're -- we'd like to do that, just like I think we've done a better job for video experience for customers and held down cable rates. And I think we've been a good influence on the productivity and the competitive nature of video and innovation. And I think we can do the same thing in wireless.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Moritz from Bloomberg.","Scott Moritz","A question for Charlie on spectrum. As you look ahead, how should we think of DISH? Are you an acquirer of spectrum or more of a seller of spectrum going forward?","Charles W. Ergen","I mean, I think we are hopefully a user of spectrum to make a better experience for consumers and make us more a productive society. I think that's what we'd like to do with our primary focus being on video. And I think the way that people should look at DISH is we're a satellite TV company on kind of part of our value and the other part of our value is a spectrum position that can be -- that will transform itself into a product or series -- sets of products in the future. And it's like an oil company having oil reserves. You have to -- they may get in the refining business. They may get in the retail gas station and convenience market. But it's all predicated on the fact that they've got the reserves in the ground even though they're not -- even though you have to go drill for them and invest first.","Scott Moritz","Maybe to follow on that. You've kind of indicated that you're not necessarily interested in building a new national wireless network. So how would you become the driller in that scenario?","Charles W. Ergen","We may not. I mean, we have the reserves. You don't have to -- you can hire -- you can do something with somebody else to drill for it, right? So I think people are putting -- are getting ahead of their skis on exactly trying to figure out what DISH will do with their spectrum, right? Because we have a lot of optionality in that spectrum today. And when you have kind of 3 big processes ahead of us in the next several months, right? One is the LightSquared bankruptcy, where we're a stalking-horse bidder. Second, we have an H-Block auction where we're going to be a participant and bid a minimum of $1.5 billion. And third, we have a waiver request in front of the FCC to convert -- give us the option to convert all of our spectrum to downlink. And those 3 things, all 3 may happen. One of those things may happen. None of those things may happen. And that will give us -- each one of those things, if it happens, will give us some more optionality and may send us down a different course. So to try to determine what course we're on today is just -- is a waste of time, right? Because you -- strategy, in my opinion, is all about putting yourself in a position that have optionality. And if you put yourself in a position you have to have optionality, then as things develop, you'll know which path to go on. Where you don't want to -- the worst strategy is -- Blockbuster was a poor strategy in our part, right? We were -- we couldn't develop optionality. We didn't get the optionality in -- like Netflix did. We didn't get optionality like Redbox did. And so we didn't -- we couldn't get optionality. So ultimately, it became a business that we needed to shut down, right? That's not where you want to be. And I think that where we are with DISH and where we are with wireless spectrum gives us optionality going forward. And when we know which path we're going to go on, you guys will be the second people to know.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Shalini Ramachandran from Wall Street Journal.","Shalini Ramachandran","So Charlie, a question for you. You and Joe, at different times, have talked about how it's important for DISH to pursue a sort of slim-down over-the-top offering. And you talked about how you tried, but didn't get anywhere with the biggest programmers. Can you give us an update on how important you think that is now, I guess in light of the sale of DirecTV, Hulu bid and kind of what you've said about Blockbuster? What do you want to have to offer it over-the-top to your pay-TV customers or to new core networks, if you will?","Charles W. Ergen","I mean -- Joe may jump in. This is Charlie. I don't want -- it's not something we're trying to drive. We're not trying to drive OTT. It's something that we thought maybe if it was going to happen, we wanted to be in front of it if it was going to happen so that we could help set some of the rules, right? So you kind of got a couple of options, right? We can lead the way, which means you get to set the rules. Or you can be a close follower, right, and which means you're going to accept somebody else's rules. Or you can be a slow follower and suffer the consequences of that. And so OTT is something that from Intel to Google to Amazon, a lot of people have talked about it. And so if content owners were going to pursue that strategy, we wanted to be on the front end of that. Our discussions really ultimately haven't led anywhere with major programming groups. So as far as we know, right, there's not an active imminent OTT kind of product that's going to be on the marketplace. That's not to say that certainly, other people may be having discussions we're unaware of. But it is not necessary -- it's not something we're -- we want to see happen in a short period of time because in effect, it has a negative effect on our current business, right? Having said that, we're not afraid of change. And if things are going to change, then we want to be involved in it. And so from an intellectual point of view, curiosity point of view, we're pretty intellectually curious about it. And Joe, you want to add to that?","Joseph P. Clayton","I'd say that we're intrigued by the market. It's basically maybe 18- to 34-year-olds that we're not attracting today. They are not going to pay $100 a month for their content. They're not going to watch 250 channels. They may watch 20 to 30. And they are not going to watch it on a 60-inch flat-panel display. They're going to watch it on their smartphone, their tablets or their PCs. Both Charlie and I both have 5 kids and ranges from about 17 to 28. And they are not your typical customers that we're selling satellite television to today.","Shalini Ramachandran","So fair to say you guys, are you still pursuing that? Or is that sort of on the table and not something you're actively pursuing right now?","Charles W. Ergen","I mean, look, we've talked to every CEO of every content company. We gave them the pitch. We were 0 for 50. They know our phone number. They know why we think it might be important or not be important. And at some point, if they decide to get in that business, we hope that we'd be able to participate. But it's -- we don't control that. I mean, it's not something we can do. We can't go knock on somebody's door and say, \"Do an OTT product.\" We can knock on your door and say, \"Here's how we think you make more money.\" And that's what we do. Here's how you guys make more money. Here's how we make more money. Let's go try it. And so far, I think for a variety of reasons, they -- most content owners have made the choice not to pursue that so far. But it doesn't mean it won't change tomorrow. But so far, that's kind of where we see it. And we haven't seen any change in the last probably 1.5 years on that subject.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Schaeffer from Carmel Group.","Jimmy Schaeffer","Just a couple of quick questions. Could you speak a bit to Sling where is the technology, the marketing growth? Could you give us a little bit of an update? And then follow-up question would be commercial and the MDU site seems to be getting a lot more attention lately. Any updates on its status vis-\u00e0-vis DISH technology marketing growth?","Joseph P. Clayton","Jimmy, it's Joe, and I'll try to take the commercial business, the MDU. Just like we've seen a transformation from digital to the high definition in the consumer space, the residential space, we have yet to see that major transformation take place in business-to-business or the commercial side. We have invested significantly in the right caliber and experienced the type of people from that space, MDUs, hospitality. Then we've also invested in new technologies more cost-effective in the new digital space. And that was just recently introduced internally. We call it \"Big Red\". And we expect to see that to pay dividends for us as we move into the next 12 to 24 months.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. And this is Charlie. I mean, I think Sling, as a technology, is more of a niche technology in the sense that you're having to process in real-time video signal, which is hard to do. But it certainly has major implications for our Hopper customers primarily because they get TV Anywhere in their house. So when you have a Hopper, -- most people use Sling actually in the house, they just use it through their WiFi system to watch TV in their tablets and their phones throughout their house or in their backyards. I think it's a piece to the puzzle, video puzzle, and those are the people that use Sling as they travel or of course, they love the product. But it's a little bit complicated. It's a little bit harder to use because of the way process is realtime. And obviously, to the extent that OTT happens in the future, and to the extent that you put video on servers, you can do a lot more and make that customer experience a little bit easier to navigate. So Sling is an EchoStar product. We license it here at DISH for the Hopper. And our customers really like it. But it's not like everybody's going to have Sling. I think it's more -- it's a little bit bigger than a niche product, but it's not an everyday product.","Jimmy Schaeffer","Charlie, can you give us some kind of idea of what kind of use it has relative to Hopper with a word or 2?","Charles W. Ergen","It's got a high degree of use in the house. So when a customer gets a Hopper, and assuming that they have broadband and WiFi in house, and assuming they set it up, then it gets high use in the house. It doesn't get much use outside the house, believe it or not, but it does get a lot in the house.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Avery from Denver Business.","Greg Avery","I'm curious in, Charlie, talking about the Disney relationship and how you want to make that your best relationship. Is altering the Hopper's PrimeTime Anytime functionality part of that discussion? Are you willing to go there if that's what it takes to make the Disney relationship better?","Charles W. Ergen","I don't know why they would want to alter that. I don't know why they'd want to alter that. I mean, I think that's the things when you get to have discussions. So the fact that we actually record ABC primetime, Disney's ABC primetime for them, and the fact that viewers can -- that if they're watching Sunday night football but they want to watch the ABC channel later, and they have the ability to that without having to record it or delete the recording. We know that their viewership goes up because of PrimeTime Anytime. They know their viewership goes up because of PrimeTime Anytime. So that really shouldn't be a -- I mean, that's a win-win situation. So they should be happy.","Greg Avery","But the ad-skipping feature has clearly bothered them. Yes, the ad-skipping feature clearly troubled them, otherwise they wouldn't be in court with you. Is that up for negotiation?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I think -- yes, I think that's a better example. So AutoHop, right, is not necessarily a good thing for Disney, right? And so what you have to combine it with the primetime anything where people watch more Disney products. And with AutoHop, they may skip a few more commercials, right? And that's kind of a wash in the relationship. The key would be can we get a relationship where we can go experiment with the Hopper, right, so that we can improve the average the viewing experience for the consumer, from an advertising perspective, it makes Disney more money, right? That's the relationship you want to have, right? And that's really what we're trying to achieve, which is -- people have DVRs. I guarantee every -- executives at Disney skip commercials. They know consumers skip commercials. Some of the advertisers haven't figured that out yet, but executives all know it, right? And so the key is to go together, right, and figure out a better experience for consumers, right? And that's really what we're trying to do.","Greg Avery","So are we likely to see some kind of settlement emerge the way over AutoHop, the way we did over AMC and Voom litigation? I mean, are we likely to that see the Disney situation resolve itself like that and take care of litigation, too?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I mean -- one of 2 things of that is going to happen. We'll have a relationship with Disney. And if we do, it will be a fair relationship for Disney and a fair relationship for DISH or we won't have a relationship, right? That's -- I don't think there's any particular one thing that anybody's going to be hung up on. I think it's really the totality of the deal. I mean, we are a huge customer of Disney. And they're going to want to maximize their profits long-term with companies like DISH. And they have to look at that in this totality. And that's the way we look at it. So whatever -- if we do have a relationship with them, again cautiously optimistic that we will, it's going to be a good relationship for both companies. And it's going to be -- it's going to get the right product to the consumers as well. Because we're not going to negotiate on giving up customer experience that we think is important.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Farrell from Multichannel News.","Mike Farrell","I just had a quick question or a couple quick questions about retrans. Do you guys, your media channel dispute is still going on. And there, I guess if they haven't already, they're set to close your Young merger today. Just wondering how that's going to kind of affect the negotiations? And just in a broader sense, just wondering what you guys, what your feelings are regarding all this consolidation that's going on in the broadcast group side? Is that going to make the next cycle even more hairy than the previous ones?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I'll talk about -- you may talk about regionals [ph] , but retransmission is kind of a broken process, right? It used to be the negotiations were a fair fight. Now the broadcaster has all the leverage. And so you're starting to see -- we recognized that probably before most companies did. But now, you're seeing almost every video provider having takedowns, the latest being Time Warner, of course. The Media General is strictly in negotiation where we do hundreds of these retransmission deals. So we know where the market price is. And we're not going to pay more than the market price for their product. But we will pay a fair rate for their product. And it's certainly a big increase to what we've paid them in the past. The merger, we have an agreement with Young today that has -- so the merger may end up with some opportunity on our side to get that settled. But it's -- Media General is looking out for their shareholders. We're looking our shareholders. And you have to have discussions to come to a common ground. And if not, we won't carry their product. And hopefully, the FCC in [ph] Congress will take a look at how they're affecting consumers, both on the rate increases, which are going up now at 3 and 4x the rate of inflation every year on all video providers, and look at what they're doing in terms of empowering the broadcaster in the way that I don't think was intended by the wall. So -- and we'll fight for that. We'll fight for the consumer in Congress. And that's all we can do. In the meantime, I think across the industry, you're going to see takedowns of product because there's a price that -- there's a point at which the price doesn't make sense. Joe, I...","Joseph P. Clayton","We're having discussions as we speak.","Operator","Your final question comes from Alex Sherman from Bloomberg.","Alex Sherman","Guys, 2 quick questions. First, Charlie, have you ruled out at this point an acquisition of T-Mobile?","Charles W. Ergen","I don't really rule out anything.","Alex Sherman","So that's still on the table? That's still part of the optionality?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, yes. I think -- I mean, look, I think acquiring a company, selling our company, merging, partnering, those are all on the table. Those are all part of optionality, right?","Alex Sherman","Second question has to do with Aereo, what we've talked about it before. And Charlie, you've mentioned that you predicted the broadcasters themselves will come out with some sort of Aereo product. I want to sort of take the other point of view. Is it possible that the operators, including DISH, would come out with some sort of product that replicates what Aereo does if the courts deem it legal so that you offer your own Aereo-type service?","Charles W. Ergen","I think from my perspective, my -- everything that we're doing today is try to work with our current content providers and try to get -- we think Aereo is a good product. And we give them a lot of credit for the technical innovation. But we'd rather work with our current content providers, broadcasters themselves, to come up with a similar product that they could do because they really controls the rights. They are the right people to do it. And we're just a distribution company. Having said that, if broadcasters decide that's not something they want to do, right, or they go too slow, then, yes, I think you will see either Aereo becoming very successful or becoming part of a bigger group. Or you could see the industry do something absent any kind of congressional look at all this kind of things. So I think there's a lot of options there. But we're not -- our only discussion today is with broadcasters themselves, which says, \"If you're going to do something like this, we'd like to participate. And we're willing to pay you a retransmission fee.\" We think that ultimately leads to the most efficient way to deliver broadcast programming over-the-top like Aereo does today.","Joseph P. Clayton","I think we're finished for the day. Thanks for everyone who joined the call. And we'll talk to you all next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to the DISH Network Corporation Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded Wednesday, November 9, 2016.","I would now like to turn the call over to Stanton Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.","R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp.","Thanks, Jose, and thank you all for joining us. I'm Stan Dodge, General Counsel at DISH Network. And Jason is actually out today. I'm joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman and CEO; Erik Carlson, our President and COO; Tom Cullen, EVP of Corporate Development; Roger Lynch, CEO Sling TV; Bernie Han, EVP; Steve Swain, our CFO; and Paul Orban, our Chief Accounting Officer.","Before we open it up for Q&A, we need to do our Safe Harbor disclosures. We ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in your report. We also do not allow audio-taping and ask that you respect that.","All statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from historical results and from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a list of those factors, please refer to the front of our 10-Q.","All cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as being applicable to any forward-looking statements that we make wherever they appear. You should carefully consider the risks described in our reports and should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements which we assume no responsibility for updating.","As part of the process for the broadcast incentive auction, we filed an application to potentially participate as a bidder for those spectrum assets. Because of the FCC's anti-collusion rules, we're not able to discuss what, if any, spectrum resources we may intend to bid on, and we will not be answering any questions about the incentive auction during today's call.","Operator, we will now open the call up first for analyst Q&A and then media Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk of BTIG. Please proceed with your question.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks, Charlie. Can you comment on if you have any \u2013 if the company is going to make any filings on the AT&T\/Time Warner deal, or if you have any personal opinions on whether you think that's a deal that should get approved by the government or even reviewed by the FCC? Thanks. And then I think, Rich, has a follow-up.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, we haven't looked \u2013 obviously, they haven't filed all their stuff, so obviously we're going to look at that. It's going to be a big deal, and we're certainly going to have some concerns. But we don't file just to file against stuff, if it is obsolete, you've got to go through whether there's harm to consumers or whether it violates anti-trust laws or whether if it could be approved, could there be conditions. So we'll take a look at all that stuff and respond appropriately when we have all the facts.","But we are anyhow \u2013 just as a sideline, we already have concerns with AT&T and potentially with DIRECTV NOW where they're working a zero rate on their AT&T system, but they won't necessarily let other providers, whether it be Sony Vue or Sling or Netflix or whatever, be zero rated on their systems. So we think that's a violation of where net neutrality is today. So we'll take a look at all that at the appropriate time.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","(4:10) Don't you think the whole zero rating thing...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Don't...","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was just wondering...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Go ahead. Sorry.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Don't you think zero rating is kind of off the table now that we have a new President-elect?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","That I don't know, but it's...","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Okay.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","... it's possible that \u2013 it certainly is possible that with the election and with the leadership in Congress that all of net neutrality might get another look. That's certainly possible.","Rich Greenfield - BTIG LLC","And then just looking at two issues, one on Sling. Obviously, Sling needs access to endpoint consumers, and net neutrality has been a key part of your strategy or in getting access along with Netflix. I'm just curious to the extent that the Trump team has spoken very negatively about net neutrality, does that change the focus of how you think about Sling or how you go about Sling? And then just any update on the Flex Pack that you launched. Was that a material benefit to the quarter in terms of people opting for lower price, smaller packages?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. So I'll take the first part. I mean obviously, I think that you could \u2013 obviously \u2013 one of the things you always worry about is \u2013 as the CEO is that Washington is something you don't really have much control over and Washington does make decisions and they pick winners and losers and so I think you have to be pretty flexible as a company to deal with that. Obviously, there's a \u2013 we think there's positive demand for services like Sling and Netflix and I think that there is \u2013 that's going to have a place in the marketplace probably no matter what happens but depending on how \u2013 depending on what regulation or not regulation there is might be depending on just may be a scale of how big that's going to be.","Positive of that is we're hedged on the linear side of the business. The Flex Pack is just to give customers more choice as people get more choice with over-the-top services, it's imperative that linear TV also offer choices to people. And that it tries to get as many of the advantages as over-the-top has as it possibly can. And Flex, it's more of a retention marketing tool than anything else. And the customers are increasingly saying we just can't afford to pay over $100 for video every month particularly for channels we don't watch. And are there other things we can do?","And rather than to just give credits to somebody which is what the norm in our industry is just to hold onto a customer so you don't have to report churn, it's better to put them into a package to right size them. So it's a strategy around that more than anything else. And I think from that perspective, it's a good strategic thing for customers. And it helps us financially and it will help us on churn. You didn't see so much of it in the third quarter because probably the biggest factor was Tribune where you had kind of a one-off event for almost the entire quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amy Yong of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Hello, Amy. Your line is open. Please proceed with your questions.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Can you hear me?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","So one for Charlie and I guess one for Roger. First, Roger, on the Sling TV, can you talk about how big the market is to support services like Sling TV and DIRECTV NOW? What are your thoughts on the competitive landscape as you position Flex Pack, Blue and Orange? And I guess, Charlie, as you think about cable perhaps entering into the wireless industry, how does that change your opinion at all on your spectrum? Thank you.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Do you want me to start?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, go ahead.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Okay. This is Roger, Amy. On Sling, when we launched the service, we were focused on initially cord-cutters and cord-nevers and cord cutting is a trend that we think has been going on for several years. There were about 25 million households in the U.S. who didn't have pay TV. So that was our initial market. As we've added more content and more devices, then we started to broaden the target market to go after people who are currently leaving the traditional pay TV ecosystem. So I think to answer your question, I'd say, it's a growing market. And it is a market that taps into some other growth segments like use of over-the-air antennas which is a growing market, broadband-only households, which is a growing market, other streaming services like Netflix, which is a growing market.","So if I were to predict what would happen at a large scale over time, I'd say that we should end up if you count services like Sling and Sony and DIRECTV's service, they're going to launch DIRECTV NOW as part of the pay TV ecosystem, I would expect it will end up with more pay TV subscribers over time, but they'll just be in different packages that give consumers more choice which I think is really what they're looking for and one of the headwinds against traditional pay TV today.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","This is Charlie. In terms of cable and what they might do in wireless, this would only be speculation on my part, but I think obviously they've looked at it. Clearly, it looks like at least one company made a deposit in the auction. And I think the AT&T potential acquisition of Time Warner probably makes them look at it a little bit more, because ultimately you're probably going to need \u2013 the world is going to \u2013 the world is looking at connectivity. And wire and wireless is part of that and to be successful, you're going to need a couple critical things. Certainly, you're going to need wireless spectrum to be in that business. You're certainly going to need scale in video which \u2013 so AT&T has both those things, and then you need a network and AT&T has that. And AT&T will have more scale in video potentially.","So that becomes bit of a threat to some incumbents around the country, and it also becomes a threat to people who maybe don't have scale in video but have wireless spectrum and a network. So DISH is uniquely positioned in that we have wireless spectrum and we have scale in video but we don't have a network. So you can imagine all the interesting things that might take place once this current auction is over.","If somebody puts all the pieces together and AT&T is on the path to do that, that makes it tougher \u2013 people on the sidelines have to do something different. In other words you can't remain on the \u2013 well, you can remain on the sidelines but that might be malpractice.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I think Tom is on the call. If he is, I'd love to get an update just on sort of chipset handset developments in the ecosystem around wireless. I think you were expecting or maybe we were expecting some fourth quarter chipset shipments around chips that included all the bands or most of the bands that your spectrum sits. And just any update on what's happened in the marketplace so we can think about 2017 and sort of the technology path around spectrum.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, Ben. This is Tom. It's our understanding \u2013 well, we know that Qualcomm is shipping a band 66 chipset that has the 70X90 configuration. And I believe Intel is on the path to do that as well. And it's our understanding that the recently released LG V20 phone that I think was launched in the U.S. about two weeks ago also supports the 70X90 band 66 configuration. So that's the first step and it's our expectation that more Android devices will start adopting that in 2017. Uncertain as to what the timing and roadmap would be for iOS.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. And just going back to Sling...","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","And I would just...","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry, go ahead.","Thomas A. Cullen - DISH Network Corp.","Excuse me, Ben. I would assume that, that somewhat will dovetail with the wide-scale deployment of AWS-3 whenever that occurs by those holders of AWS-3 spectrum that purchased it last year.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Ben, this is Charlie. I mean, I think it's likely that our band 66 will be in handsets before we'd have a network or somebody \u2013 before there would be a network from us. But there will be other people who build AWS-3 out over the next year or two. And that's critical because you \u2013 it doesn't do you any good to have a work and then no handset that can receive it. So you would like to have a year or two of handsets out there before something on your network got turned on.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. Make sense. And then just coming back to Sling, Roger, I'm sure you thought through sort of DIRECTV NOW and how that may or may not be positioned in the marketplace. How do you think about Sling competitively with Now? And do you think you're attacking similar parts of the market? And any color on the quarter in terms of mix between the Orange, Blue or the combo tier, which looks pretty compelling even if it is a little less skinny.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Well, obviously, we're waiting to see what DIRECTV NOW ends up launching with. But it sounds like it'll be a pretty full bundle with 100 channels that I would expect would go after the traditional pay TV ecosystem and probably something like Sony Vue, which is also a bigger bundle. It's a different strategy than we pursued from the beginning. Our strategy was never to recreate that big bundle. It was to try to create a lot more consumer choice, and that's what we do with something like Sling Orange, which starts at $20 and then you can just add channels that you want.","In terms of mix, we're seeing momentum, frankly, with all of our packages: Sling Orange, Sling Blue and people who take both. So I think it's \u2013 I think we've been able to construct our packages in a way that gives consumers choice and we're seeing them choose all of the above.","Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Wanted to ask you a couple of questions. First, if you could update us on the Designated Entity case, where that stands and what you expect as far as timing on a ruling as well as what might happen after the ruling in terms of appeals, et cetera. And I guess I just wanted to follow up on the last question too. Just on DIRECTV NOW specifically on the pricing, I mean at $35, it's priced at about $5 below Sling Orange plus Blue for I think about 2x the number of channels. And just whether you think that you might have to do something different in terms of structuring the tiers for pricing. And also on Sling, can you help us just to understand your cost position on the CDN side, what your total cost of \u2013 you probably won't want to quantify it but just to help us understand whether you may be at an advantage or disadvantage to others in the space on your streaming costs? Thank you.","R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp.","Hey, Bryan, this is Stanton. On your first question about the DE case, it's fully briefed and it's been argued in the DC Circuit and we would expect an opinion from them probably the first half of next year, although difficult to predict. And as to any potential result, it's really impossible to predict.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And either side could appeal or \u2013 I'm sorry.","R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp.","Sorry?","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Either side could appeal the ruling if they're not happy with it?","R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp.","Sure. You could seek a rehearing en banc at the DC Circuit or you could file a petition for cert at the Supreme Court.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Okay. Bryan, just on your Sling questions. Well, first of all, on DIRECTV NOW, we haven't seen the channel package that they're going with. And so 100 channels is a lot of channels but are they channels that people care about and are they channels that people are willing to pay more for? If you think about the Sling Orange package, it's $20, so $35 is 75% higher price for it. There are a lot more channels and if they're all channels that people value, then it'll be good value and I'm sure it'll be a popular package but we haven't seen it yet. So I can't really comment on that or whether it would cause us to rethink how we do our packaging. In general, we're very pleased with how we do our packaging because it really, really embraces consumer choice rather than just saying you've got to buy all these channels.","In terms of CDN costs, this is \u2013 in my career I've been buying bandwidth for 17 years or 18 years and every year the cost of bandwidth drops and drops and drops significantly. And that's been the case also with CDN costs. So to the point where four years, five years ago, it would have been a material cost in the operation of a business like Sling, and today, it's not immaterial but it is not a cost that we worry about because those costs have continued to come down so significantly. And I think we get \u2013 because of the volume that we stream, we stream a \u2013 because our customers watch a lot of television, I think we get quite good pricing on CDN.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Maybe just a broader question. How do you see the live OTT market evolving over time? I mean how big as a percentage of traditional multichannel distribution or multichannel video product could it get? And is there enough room for not just Sling and DIRECTV NOW, but all the other guys that are lining up to enter \u2013 Hulu, maybe YouTube, maybe Amazon? Just your view on how you see the competitive landscape over time would be great.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I think that OTT in general has the potential to be as big or bigger than the DBS business, right? It's the next way to watch live TV, right? Cable, then satellite and now, OTT because it has some built-in advantages, right? It's immediate. It's just an app so you don't have to wait for an installer. You don't have two-year contracts. You can watch on any device. The advertising can be more meaningful to you. It can be more directed to you. So there's a lot of different things you can do with it. And you can have everything stored in the cloud so you don't really need a DVR because you can have network DVR and you can have start-over and then it just \u2013 it can be a much simpler user experience. So there's a lot of built-in advantages in terms of where OTT can go. That's the positive. The danger is that the ecosystem ends up so chopped up that it's truly an \u00e0 la carte experience. The barrier-to-entry are not great, right? So pretty much anybody could enter into the marketplace. So, there's a lot of technical things you've got to do and there's some capital and so forth. But there's certainly big guys, big companies that could enter the business.","But for example, not everybody maybe wants sports, right? So that if you're \u2013 I imagine Viacom would sell to anybody whether they had sports or not. So there's going to be packages with no sports. That means that people \u2013 it gets to where people like football, they may watch September, October, November. They may watch the football and then they may drop that service and go to somebody who doesn't have sports in February, March, April, May, June, right? Or they may like hockey and watch that for four months out of the year.","So you're going to \u2013 and it's pretty easy to switch providers, right? You just push a button. So it's not like you got to wait for an installer and learn a new operating system and lose all your DVR functionality. So I've always been concerned that the content creators are going to end up in a place that's maybe not so good for them. But it should be good for consumers. So the business will definitely grow.","So that's kind of the landscape, we don't know. We know there's seasonality to it. We know that the churn can be high one month and low one month. We know that people can come in for a big event and then drop out the next month. We know that people like HBO, you can come in for Game of Thrones and then six weeks later drop out, or you can binge-view and drop out. And then you wait for the next year Game of Thrones, because that's the only thing on HBO you watch, right?","So it's an interesting, interesting business. And we'll have to see how it all transacts and how people strategically do it. But it does have some risk that it's going to be disruptive to the marketplace for at least a period of time until people sort it out. Having said that, Roger's now in his seventh year doing this. There's a lot of things that we put in place for depending on which way it goes and we've maintained the flexibility that we need here and the technology is not so easy to duplicate overnight. And so we think we're positioned in whatever direction it goes. But we just don't know, right?","As Roger said, there's some momentum in the business. I would expect that with DIRECTV coming in, the momentum for the \u2013 at least for the segment will grow. And we'll see what happens.","John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I have two. First, Charlie, I am curious as to your thoughts on AT&T buying Time Warner in general because it is a change in strategy. There is not a lot of synergy, if at all. So what do you think it says about the wireless business in general? And presumably you're going to enter the wireless business, so does it make you more nervous?","And then the second question has to do with Sling. I think you said at one point that you are paying the same rate for the programmers for Sling as you do for the linear channels. Is that still the case, or are there some channels where you pay more and some where you pay less? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I don't think we'll get into how much we pay for channels but obviously we look at our business holistically when we do transactions. I mean we don't just pick one piece or the other. So we look at it and we have scale and we look at everything. AT&T, I think, AT&T has talked about some of their logic. There was obviously some logic to their purchase \u2013 acquisition of DIRECTV. This is another step to get content and maybe control that a little bit more and be a bigger player there.","Time Warner is a good company. They're very profitable. If it's potentially accretive to what they're doing, it could make sense. In and by itself from a financial basis, it could make sense regardless of whether there was any synergy or strategy to it. So you'd have to ask them as to why they're doing it, why they're doing it. But they clearly still have a good wireless business and everybody is going to have a different strategy in terms of going forward. It's interesting. It's a different dynamic and it will put some pressure on some of the other incumbents.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Thanks. I had two quick questions. One, now that Sling's becoming a really meaningful part of the business, I am wondering if you can give us some color on how many subscribers you have got on Sling at this point. And if not, at what point you will start giving us a breakout of the old traditional business versus Sling.","And then my second question was, I think you are in an uncommon position to understand what the over-the-top business is doing to networks in general. And I am wondering if you've got any data from your users on when people adopt Sling, how much it increases their data traffic. How much of that is consumed over mobile versus on television sets? And what do you think that does for network congestion in general and for spectrum demand?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Steve, you want to take the question?","Steven E. Swain - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, sure. So as far as Sling subs and DBS subs, last year, we explained our thought process on reporting DBS and Sling subs together. So we won't re-explain that logic again. We do, however, revisit that decision every quarter. So we won't elaborate further, but that is something we come back to every quarter.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Roger, is the...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","And the...","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","... press estimate of 1 million subs plausible on Sling?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","We're not going to really comment on that.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Okay. Hey Jonathan, this is Roger. I'll...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","By the way, we're not trying to hide any \u2013 I mean we're not trying to hide anything there. There'll be a time to report it when it makes sense for us. But you can look at the \u2013 I don't know, what's that metric that comes out that shows the kind of pecking order where people...","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Parks Associates. You talking about the...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, Parks Associates. Sling moved from number 10 to number 6, I think...","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","...over last year behind...","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Of streaming services. Yeah, the top five stayed the same and then Sling moved from 10 to 6.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","So there's some momentum there, anyway.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Jonathan, as far as what it's doing to networks, I assume you're talking about broadband networks because you asked about...","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Yeah, exactly. Broadband networks both wired and wireless.","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. Well, I mean, similar to my earlier comment about the cost of bandwidths going down, the amount of bandwidths available on these networks has been growing very, very significantly. And so we know the mobile networks are \u2013 the spectrum is more scarce than bandwidth that's available over wireline networks today. But generally, the way we think about mobile is, it's really important to our business because of the utility that people get by being able to watch all of their channels on Sling wherever they go. So we don't have a distinction of are you in the home, are you out of the home? Is this on a set-top box or not? It's just all of your channels are available wherever you go. So that's important for us because it's a way that we activate customers by advertising on mobile devices and then getting people to download the app, do a free trial, start streaming.","But ultimately, the majority of viewing happens on a TV set because the hours per session on a TV set are much longer than the hours per session or minutes per session on a mobile device. But that shouldn't be an indication that mobile is not important. It's quite important.","And in terms of what does it do to the networks themselves? What we see is the majority of viewing on mobile devices happens over Wi-Fi networks. We are starting to see shifts in that because you see competitors in the mobile space like T-Mobile or Sprint, which are embracing unlimited data services. And we certainly have seen the amount of mobile streaming go up with services like that. And T-Mobile when they launched Binge On, we saw viewing go up on that. So I would expect over time us to see more and more mobile viewing as that market competes on unlimited data.","Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research LLP (US)","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Maybe just a comment on what you are seeing out there as far as cord-cutting goes, anything you can size for us there. Also, perhaps a comment on any migrations you are seeing from linear over to Sling within your own business. And then, finally, if you don't mind, just on the linear side your view on pricing flexibility.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah, this is Charlie. I'd say, general trends, we don't see a lot of cord-cutting from DISH to Sling, primarily because the way Roger explained it to an earlier question, it's a little bit different product. It's not really appealing to a guy who wants to watch a lot of stuff. It skews younger and people who are cord-nevers or have already cut the cord somewhere else. There's a few, but it's not a lot.","We do see a growing trend to cord-cutting. It ranges from people totally cutting the cord and just watching network TV with Hopper antenna to maybe adding Hulu or Netflix or Amazon or a combination of those to people who add Sony Vue or Sling or maybe now DIRECTV NOW. So there's a way for people to cut their bill and still get enough viewing to satisfy their need. If you really need a channel, you can go to a bar or restaurant, your neighbor's house. My kids will come to my house if they really want to watch something.","So the customer has a lot of choice. It's very competitive. The customer has a lot of choice. And I think it's going be something people \u2013 there's going to be a transition, just like there has been from a landline for a phone to wireless. And that transition is going to take place over the next 20 years, and it's going to be \u2013 how fast it goes and whether it accelerates is anybody \u2013 it hasn't really accelerated yet, I mean like you had the hockey stick hasn't kind of taken off yet. It's still kind of a slow burn, so to speak, but we expect that it might accelerate at some point in time, particularly with \u2013 as other people \u2013 as Hulu comes to market, AT&T comes to market, that might have some acceleration. And if there's acceleration, then the whole world has to respond.","So what we've done at DISH is we have a collection of assets that we think are in a position to respond to pretty much anything that happens, right? We've got scale in video. We've got technology in an OTT service that we've got a user interface and a technical interface, and now we know how to do dynamic ad insertion and we're going to know how to do network DVR. We know how to do digital set-top boxes. We know how to do billing. We know how to do an in-home installation and service and dispatch, and we have virgin nationwide sweet spot spectrum that can be used for connectivity and Internet of Things and so forth. And I think for us the strategy \u2013 we don't know the answer to this but the strategy is how do those assets get put to use to their maximum value for our shareholders? And to some degree, I say this many times, we're a mid-size communications company, so we don't exactly get to make all those decisions. Sometimes the decision is going to be made because somebody else is going do something strategic that then opens up an opportunity for us to do something that we didn't know exists, or somebody does something that changes the paradigm that forces companies to talk together that didn't talk together before and that kind of stuff.","So I think we have a lot of assets, and obviously we've got to put them to the best use that we possibly can. Today, that's DISH doing what we're doing. Obviously, that potentially can change. An AT&T, Time Warner merger might be a change element, might be a catalyst to change, right? So we'll see.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","And then just talking about pricing flexibility?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Pricing flexibility, I think is \u2013 I think on the linear side, it's becoming more difficult, right? There's still room for us. We're still kind of lowest-cost guys out there. We still skew a little bit more rural where it's a little bit less competitive, so we still have a little bit of pricing power, but I think that the pricing power probably at best would make up for the price increases you're seeing from the content providers. So it's going be a margin business that's going to fight some inertia. We're a little bit more fortunate than most, but it's still \u2013 there's going to become a limit to what the content providers can do on price increases. There's going to be a limit \u2013 there's starting to be a limit now we're seeing on. We learned a lot with the Tribune takedown and there's starting to be a limit on maybe retrans fees and things like that because customers start finding alternatives at some price. So I don't know if we're there yet or not, but we're pretty close.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. A lot of discussion on high throughput satellites. How do you view the increasing capacity coming online here over the next couple of quarters to years, and how it's going to affect your business? Any concerns on the launch schedule changes? And maybe a longer-term question, it seems to us that, given the change of pace in technology, possibly satellite should be looked at as maybe a shorter lifetime and cheaper costs. But just wondered your thoughts on the whole high throughput satellite industry and what's going on, and how it would affect you guys.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","This is Charlie, and it's probably a better question for all the EchoStar folks but I'll speak to it as it relates to DISH. We're indirectly involved with high throughput satellite because of satellite broadband which we sell and obviously the launch of both Hughes and ViaSat, both have high throughput satellites. They're going to focus \u2013 it'll be beamed on the United States which will open up a lot of capacity which will do two things. One, it hopefully will reduce churn in that category so we can give people more bandwidth. And it opens up more opportunity to sell those \u2013 sell more units where we have \u2013 where today many beams are closed on both of those providers today. So in part \u2013 and the vast majority of the country today, we can't put in satellite broadband even if we wanted to because we don't have the capacity on the satellites to do it. So high throughput satellites make satellite broadband more economical, so I think that's a positive for our business. I'm sure it's a positive for their business. And that's the way it directly affects us.","From a video perspective, we're the first guys to do spot beams. And that really helps at the local and some other things. It gives you some more bandwidth to do some different things in advertising potentially where you can start storing advertising on people's hard drives and the advertising model gets better. So there's some peripheral things that satellite technology are helping with. But high throughput satellites are going have probably a bigger impact for the ViaSats and the Hughes of the world as that technology expands around the world, and as it starts connecting ships and planes and other mobility sites in a way that they were never connected before. In other words, you're going to be flying around the world and you're going to be connected and you're going to have full streaming of video just like you do in your home. And that's going be a \u2013 that's probably going to be a high throughput satellite product.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. And...","R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp.","Operator, we'll take -sorry. Is there a follow-up?","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, just wondering any thoughts on \u2013 the satellites used to go up for 15 years, 20 years, but the pace of technology seems to be changing fast as you guys are trying to change your model too.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, it's a little bit off the subject for DISH but I mean I do believe that the lower \u2013 that some of the companies are working on lower satellites and thousands of satellites that have a life span of two years, three years but that's going to have a place in the world of connectivity. Because there's low latency and you can change them out and the cost of launches go down as soon as you can reuse rockets, which a couple companies are doing now. So that's a paradigm shift on that. And then I think the industry is struggling with the fact, do you build a 15-year satellite for hundreds of millions of dollars? Or do you build satellites for a lot less expensive, they last three years, four years, five years? And that was never an option before because the cost of the launch was so great. But as the cost of launch has come down, if you can reuse rockets, I think you could make the leap, right, that there is a paradigm shift to smaller, faster builds, more launches, more satellites in the future whether it be LEOs, MEOs or GEOs.","Ric H. Prentiss - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Very helpful. Thanks.","R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp.","And operator, we'll take one more question from the analysts and then we'll switch to media Q&A.","Operator","Very well. We will now take our final question from the analyst community. Our final analyst question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Just a couple from me. The first on your beef (40:12) during the Tribune dispute as well as earlier disputes. You guys had a little bit of an experiment in a way distributing free antennas. Just wanted to understand what the experience with that was. And you've also seen the number of antenna-only homes in the U.S. grow over the last maybe year and a half or so at a faster pace. How do you guys think about that as an opportunity potentially from a cost perspective for the legacy business?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I mean we've done \u2013 our customers have Hopper antennas, they have for years. Some portion of our \u2013 it has grown and not so much for our customers but it's grown more for the cord-cutter who \u2013 look, you can read the blogs and see it every day where somebody gets Netflix and Hopper antenna and they are happy with that for their viewing needs. So it's not a big part of our business. We've done some of it. We certainly did it in the Tribune dispute. Many of those customers will remain satisfied and didn't come back to Tribune channels. But some of those customers weren't satisfied and they did come back. So it's a household by household kind of thing. I don't know that Hopper antennas are a replacement for the more traditional way of doing it that we and satellite and cable business do it unless retrans just got too high. There could be a breaking point where people will go through the pain of getting an Hopper antenna but we're not there yet. The vast majority won't do it yet.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And just a follow-up on programming costs. So when we look at the subscriber-related expenses, obviously, that benefits as the net adds go down, but also, you guys had a few disputes and some of the channels were off. Going forward, when we look at that particular line item, is there any reason to expect that the trend line will continue to be low to mid single digits instead of what we have seen historically?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I think it depends on when your programming contracts are up. But there remains pressure of higher prices in the linear television business, right? And that's going to change because you're going to \u2013 as you get into OTT and people have more choices and there ends up being more \u00e0 la carte offerings, people are going to \u2013 in my opinion, will look to leave linear television because the price is too high and the bundle is too big, right? So you say why am I going to spend $120 for this when I can get it from this vendor or that vendor or I can switch seasonality between this vendor and this vendor or maybe I'll pay $60 a month during football season and maybe I'll pay $30 a month after football season. And I can switch between vendors and so it's going to put pressure on the other sides of the linear television business. And my only message to the content people is there's things we could do about it to make that content better and the environment richer for our customers but it involves things like changing the 16 minutes of commercials. It means we got to change things so we need to be able to do binge viewing for customers with the lower advertising load.","We need to have dynamic ads for customers that are more meaningful to the people. We have to make it a better product for people so they're willing to pay more for it. We have to make it more convenient product for them so they'll do it and not all linear content companies move that fast. But if you have a long-term contract, you don't really want to change it because you know you're going to get that amount of revenue for a period of time. So it takes a bit of a forward thinker on the content side to say let's change things now so that when we get to the end of that contract we're not in a situation where you take us down, right, or we lose your service because we don't have a product that people watch anymore, right?","And not to pick on anybody but Viacom and Sony that was just yesterday where Sony \u2013 I think Sony Vue announced that they were going eliminate all the 22 Viacom channels. Well, that means that a customer now can get a \u2013 that's a lower cost for Sony Vue, and if you don't watch a Viacom channel you have a different choice. And if you want Viacom channels, then maybe you're going to be able to go to DIRECTV NOW or Sling or somebody else. But if you don't want Viacom channels, you're going to have a choice now. You're not going to have to buy them. So that's a change and that's good for consumers but it's going to put pressure on all the content providers.","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take questions from members of the media. Our first media question comes from the line of Scott Moritz of Bloomberg. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Great. Can you guys hear me?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Great. Charlie, a question. I know we are only hours into this election results, but wanted to get your reaction. Over the years, you've described in these acquired assets toward a vision of having a next-generation video service. Do you see a Trump administration helping to advance that strategy or hinder it? And if so, why?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, it's a little bit hard because obviously the \u2013 because the President-elect was not that specific on his policies and we don't know who the cabinet members and the regulators would be. But if I take a general look at it, I think the potential negative is just uncertainty and that ultimately is going to go away but that's going to be a negative for a while because we just don't know necessarily what the policies and the people who will be in charge of those policies would do.","Once that gets in place, that will dissipate to some degree. But the positives are, I don't think there's any question that the President-elect and the fact that the Republicans and the Republican leadership in the Congress that you're probably going to see bipartisan support for infrastructure. You're probably going to see a more rational tax code, particularly as it relates to corporate taxes and particularly as it relates to maybe bringing overseas money back which then can pay for infrastructure. So I think those are all potentially big positives for business in general. I think you're going to see lighter regulation, which I think could help GDP. Any time you have less regulation, you have a better chance for GDP growth. I think you have a chance now for maybe immigration reform and maybe some bipartisan support for immigration reform. That would be a positive for GDP. So you've got a lot of potential policy positives for business in general.","And then those companies where you might have CapEx, whether it be satellites or networks or connectivity in rural America or connectivity in inner cities or things like that, DISH is positioned in those areas should this administration decide to go that route, which I think there's a high likelihood they will because this was an election about people, it's always the have and have-nots, and the have-nots voted for Donald Trump. And so they don't have as much \u2013 rural America doesn't have as much connectivity, right? Inner city doesn't have as much. So those things we would expect to probably see some real initiatives there. And certainly, if you bring back billions of dollars from overseas, it's going to go into this economy here and that's going to \u2013 so we think there are some positives there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shalini Ramachandran of Wall Street Journal. Please proceed with your question.","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal","Thanks. Hi, guys. Just following up a little bit on Scott's question, specifically on how the Trump administration would affect net neutrality and potential deals. I was curious for your thoughts given that Trump has said that he would kill AT&T\/Time Warner. I'm not sure \u2013 I don't think that those companies are taking that seriously at the moment, but I was curious for your thoughts specifically on those two points.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Well, I think you always got to take seriously when somebody is running for president what \u2013 you have to take seriously what they say. But obviously, I think any candidate would reserve the right to change their mind if they had different facts that do it. So I think that the regulatory process there is probably as unknown as it was before the election. And I forget the first part.","R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp.","Net neutrality.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","Net neutrality. I think \u2013 in general, I think the Republican leadership, whether it be in the Congress or the executive branch, and potentially now in the Supreme Court, would have a lighter hand to regulation. And so you may see net neutrality be challenged or weakened going forward. But the American public also has come to make sure that \u2013 the American public, the same people that voted in the election are going to say I want my \u2013 I want to be treated fairly and I don't want to be gouged. And you're going see a balance there, I think.","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Malathi Nayak of Reuters. Please proceed with your question.","Malathi Nayak - Reuters","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up on that previous question, do you think, Charlie, that media industry consolidation faces a high risk under the Trump administration? Like what could happen to a potential CBS\/Viacom deal or the AT&T\/Time Warner deal?","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","I mean that's the uncertainty part that I talked about. We just don't know until you see who's going to be heading up the Justice Department and who's going to be heading up the FCC. And in general, the Republicans would have a lighter regulatory and I think they're probably \u2013 in general, I think there's going to be more flexibility in M&A transactions, right? So I think you'll see more where it makes sense and where it doesn't harm the public interest and where it doesn't violate anti-trust laws, I think, people \u2013 my gut feels people today are looking at or not today maybe but once you have some certainty on the administration, people will then take a look at those policies and see what people say about it and maybe what their track records are and they'll, at that point, determine whether they think M&A is gotten \u2013 the regulation will be less or more or the same.","Malathi Nayak - Reuters","Got it. Let me ask one question...","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","My get feels the regulation will be less but I don't think that's any breaking \u2013 I don't think that's any breaking news but I think the regulation will be less.","Malathi Nayak - Reuters","Got it. If I could ask Roger one question. In terms of your marketing initiatives with Sling TV, will we see a lot more investment on marketing the product now that there is going to be increased competition from, say, Hulu, and AT&T's upcoming services?","Roger Lynch - DISH Network Corp.","Yeah. We've already been ramping up our marketing ever since we launched. So it's not in response to competition or expected competition but more in response to when we feel we're ready to expand either because we have additional content or we have additional devices or we're going after new market that we weren't going after before. So you saw just in the last couple months we started with television advertising because we now feel like our product can appeal to a broader segment of the market than we could before we had all the devices that we're on and all the content that we have. So that ramp-up has already been happening and we're seeing good momentum from it.","Malathi Nayak - Reuters","Got it. Thank you.","R. Stanton Dodge - DISH Network Corp.","All right. Is that it? That's it.","Charles William Ergen - DISH Network Corp.","All right. Thanks, everybody. We'll be on in February. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DISH Network Corporation Q3 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Robert Olson. You may begin your call, sir.","Robert E. Olson","Thank you, Heidi. My name is Robert Olson. I am the CFO at DISH Network. I'm joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman; Joe Clayton, our CEO; Tom Cullen, Executive Vice President; Bernie Han, COO; Paul Orban, our Controller; and Stanton Dodge, our General Counsel. Before turning it over to Joe for his remarks, I would like to have Stanton cover our Safe Harbor disclosures.","R. Stanton Dodge","Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. As you know, we invite media to participate in listen-only mode on the call and ask that you not identify participants or their firms in your reports. We also do not allow audio taping and ask that you respect that.","All statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements, which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from historical results and from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a list of those factors, please refer to the front of our 10-Q.

We assume no responsibility for updating any forward-looking statements.","And with that out of the way, I'll turn it back over to Robert.","Robert E. Olson","Thanks, Stanton. I'd like to now turn it over to Joe for his remarks on our third quarter results.","Joseph P. Clayton","Thanks, Robert. And good afternoon to you on the East Coast and good morning to our West Coast participants.","The third quarter brought to a close my first full year as DISH CEO. And I believe that we are on track with the commercial revitalization and the transformation of DISH evolving from an engineering-driven organization to more consumer-focused approach. Putting the customer first and giving the consumer what he or she wants is a winning formula for success. Today, we are clearly focused on embracing change, embracing technology and embracing the consumer. DISH is indeed better off today than just one short year ago.","While I am pleased with our commercial transformation of the DISH brand and improvement in subscriber trends, there is still much more work to be done in terms of our financial performance. It is no secret that the pay-TV industry continues to face a difficult economic environment in a more price-sensitive marketplace. The pay-TV business is now at a maturation point. The days of double-digit growth in our business are over. Going forward, we must deal with single-digit growth, and even that rate assumes that the economy rebounds and new home formations restart. Faced with slow subscriber growth plus faster-than-inflation programming cost increases, there is no question that the entire industry will have to rethink its current business model and strategy.","At DISH, we continue to develop a portfolio of assets that will serve as the foundation of our future growth, and that brings us to our wireless initiative. First, our wireless spectrum status is generally unchanged. We continue to work with the FCC on the AWS-4 rulemaking process. The FCC chairman has publicly stated that we will have a decision by the end of the year, and Charlie and Tom will take your questions on wireless in a few minutes.","Now let me briefly give you all an update on Blockbuster. During the second quarter conference call, I told you all that we were going through a transition period with Blockbuster as well, and I enumerated the actions that we had taken to improve the business. While we did incur a small operating loss in the quarter, I believe that we are properly positioned to capitalize on a seasonably stronger fourth quarter. We've already made investments in a new merchandising strategy and improved in-store displays. We'll also have a deeper inventory and high-impact titles that will be released during the fall selling season. This has been accomplished by negotiated -- negotiating improved trading terms with most of our studio partners.","As we move into the fourth quarter, which is traditionally the highest-performing quarter for all retailers, we expect revenues to improve above and beyond the seasonal impact due to our new marketing and merchandising initiatives. And going forward, we will focus on individual store profitability and the execution of our long-term strategy.","Now let's move on to the third quarter DISH highlights. First, we showed improvement in our subscriber performance. In the third quarter, we had gross activations of 739,000. This is a sequential improvement of 11% over the previous quarter and a 13% improvement over last year. We lost approximately 19,000 net subscribers from the end of the second quarter, giving DISH a total of 14,042,000 subscribers as of September 30. Now while disappointed in the loss of even 1 customer, we were 92,000 net additions better than our 2011 third quarter results.","We're also pleased with our churn performance. It came in at 1.8%. While this is higher than last quarter, this is again an improvement over 2011. This was accomplished despite a number of significant headwinds in our business: the AMC channel's takedown; several difficult local retransmission negotiations, with Sinclair and Gannett being the largest; and a brief Big Ten Network takedown. While unsettling for our customers, we took these actions to stem the tide of spiraling programming costs and thus minimize price increases for our customers. Obviously, we were not alone. Other pay-TV providers had similar high-profile takedowns in the quarter.","Now as part of our effort to provide additional programming value to our customers, we were pleased to announce that DISH and the Pac-12 Network entered into an agreement making DISH the only satellite provider to offer Pac-12 sports programming, including football and basketball events. This new agreement also provides DISH with exclusive category sponsorship for Pac-12 athletic programs, such as stadium signage and logo rights with each of the member schools.","We were also focused on subscriber quality in the quarter. We continued to gradually increase the mix of DVR and IP-connected subscribers in our customer base. Again, this growth was primarily driven by the Hopper, our award-winning whole-home HD DVR, supported with an aggressive marketing campaign. Not only have our national TV commercials, radio spots, newspaper ads and billboards been well received by the buying public, but so have our online and e-commerce marketing efforts. In fact, we exceeded 2.3 million Facebook likes, surpassing our satellite TV competitor by over 500,000. This time last year, we were just slightly over 2,000 likes, so we are making great progress here.","Our customer service metrics continued to improve in the quarter. On top of the main news that the ACSI, the American Customer Satisfaction Index, ranked DISH first among the nation's largest satellite and cable providers in customer satisfaction, J.D. Powers' 2012 Residential Television Service Provider Satisfaction Study showed that DISH had made steady gains on a regional basis. Although we stayed flat in the south, we made improvement in the East and North Central regions, and we finished #1 in the Western region. We believe that customer service will ultimately be one of DISH's competitive advantages as we move forward. Again, our focus is on the customer.","Now I want to highlight additional returns from our drive for operational excellence. DISH was recently recognized by CIO magazine for our successful billing transformation project. Their annual award recognizes organizations from around the world that exemplify the highest level of operational and strategic excellence in information technology.","As I mentioned during the first quarter call, our 2-year program literally transformed our operational support systems, including our customer billing system. IVR and our workforce management process sufficiently assigns and manages thousands of DISH daily installation and service jobs nationwide. Our IP organization, according to InformationWeek, also landed in the top 100 best information technology innovators in the country. And lastly, our CIO, Mike McClaskey, was recognized with the 2012 transformational CIO award from the Enterprise CIO Forum. So clearly, this effort was Herculean, leading to increased flexibility, productivity and efficiency in our DISH operations.","Another highlight of the quarter was the national introduction of our dishNET broadband services. We launched this product with great fanfare at a 12-store regional retailer, Cowboy Maloney's, in Jackson, Mississippi. The significance of Cowboy Maloney's is that it also served as the launch site of satellite TV back in 1994 and the introduction location for Sirius Satellite Radio in 2002. I guess big satellite things just seem to happen in Jackson. But more importantly, we will be able to provide high-speed Internet to the nearly 15 million rural Americans with no or slow broadband access.","It's not only our intent to provide an Internet solution to this underserved market but to give customers faster speeds, greater capacity and the convenience of bundling with video, which is an obvious win for customers but also a win for DISH as bundled customers have a lower churn rate. Like wireless, this move to provide broadband in a capital-efficient manner is clearly on our strategic road map. Our dishNET service began October 1, and we'll give you all an update at our next analyst call.","And finally, let me address an out-of-quarter event that impacted our third quarter results. That's our settlement of the VOOM litigation last month. As you all may know, we agreed to pay $700 million to resolve all pending litigation with VOOM. Additionally, the agreement calls for Cablevision to transfer certain of its wireless licenses to DISH. And finally, we entered into an agreement to bring the AMC channel back to DISH, as well as other AMC Networks channels including IFC, WE tv, the Sundance Channel and Fuse.","In summary, with the exception of the litigation expense accrual associated with the VOOM settlement, our third quarter results were generally consistent with the trends during the last few quarters.","Now to provide you all with greater details on our financial performance, here's our CFO, Robert Olson.","Robert E. Olson","Thank you, Joe. I'm going to start by reviewing the impacts of the VOOM settlement on our financial results. Even though the settlement was reached in late October, this was a type 1 subsequent event, which requires it to be reflected in our third quarter results. There were 3 separate elements to this agreement, which we evaluated to determine their fair market value: the settlement of the outstanding litigation, the purchase of certain spectrum licenses and a long-term programming agreement. Based on this work, our third quarter income statement reflects $730 million of litigation expense associated with the VOOM settlement.","Adjusting for taxes using a rate of approximately 38%, the VOOM settlement had a $453-million impact on net income in the quarter. Adding this amount to our reported net loss of $158 million yields an adjusted net income of $295 million, which was down 8% versus third quarter last year. The year-over-year decline was largely due to higher programming costs and increased activations this year, which drove up total acquisition spending.","Our reported EPS for the quarter was a loss of 30 -- $0.35 per share. Adjusting for the VOOM settlement, our fully diluted EPS was $0.65 per share.","As Joe mentioned, we continued to make progress in several areas in the third quarter. Our gross activations were up 83,000 versus third quarter 2011 and up 74,000 compared to last quarter. Churn also improved slightly year-over-year, although it was up sequentially due to normal seasonality and the programming issues that Joe mentioned. The result was a loss of 19,000 net subscribers in the third quarter in what is typically a tough quarter for DISH and the industry.","Subscriber-related revenue was up 1.2% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by slightly higher average subscribers and slightly higher ARPU. The year-over-year increase in ARPU was driven by higher hardware-related revenue. ARPU was down $0.54 sequentially due to fewer pay-per-view events this quarter.","Subscriber-related expenses increased by 6.3% in the third quarter versus last year. This increase was due largely to higher programming expense. Programming costs were primarily driven by increases in our contractual rates.","Blockbuster had a $12-million operating loss in the quarter driven by weaker revenue per store. Some of this revenue shortfall was due to seasonality, as the business is normally stronger in the first and fourth quarters. As Joe mentioned, we have numerous initiatives underway to improve revenue. We ended the third quarter with approximately 850 domestic stores.","Our SAC for the quarter was $805 per activation, which was up $16 versus third quarter last year. This increase was largely driven by higher brand advertising expense associated with marketing the Hopper set-top box. SAC was roughly flat sequentially.","Administrative expenses were down $52 million year-over-year in the third quarter. This reduction was a result of fewer Blockbuster domestic stores this year. G&A expenses for the DISH pay-TV business were roughly flat year-over-year.","Interest income was up $26 million year-over-year, driven by higher balances of cash and marketable securities and by the mix of marketable securities. Other income increased $50 million in the third quarter relative to 2011, driven by gains on the sale of marketable investment securities.","We generated $424 million of free cash flow in the third quarter and roughly $1.35 billion through the first 9 months of the year. We expect free cash flow will be negative in the fourth quarter due to the litigation settlement, which was paid on October 23.","There were a few major changes in the balance sheet relative to second quarter. The VOOM settlement drove an increase in the litigation accrual on the balance sheet ending September 30. We also issued an additional $1 billion of debt on July 26. The proceeds from this debt largely ended up in cash and marketable securities.","Let me now turn it back to Joe before we start Q&A.","Joseph P. Clayton","Thanks, Robert.","I believe that today's third quarter results clearly show that we continued to make progress. Unquestionably, there is much more work to do, but we are committed to growing high-value subscribers, increasing revenue and investing for long-term growth.","Thank you all for joining us today for our Third Quarter Earnings Call. Now we'll open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker of Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. I have 2 questions. One is strategic and then one is for Robert in terms of modeling. So, Robert, you said churn was up sequentially due to normal seasonality and programming issues. So assuming that you don't have big programming issues in the fourth quarter, should we see a higher amount of year-over-year improvement in churn for the fourth quarter?","Robert E. Olson","Well, Marci, we generally don't provide forecasts. However, the fourth quarter churn will be lower just due to normal seasonality. We obviously had a little bit of carryover effect of the AMC dispute into the -- into October. But as we've talked about in prior calls, we continue to manage the churn to balance the retention spending with the customer satisfaction and keeping overall churn at reasonable levels.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is for Charlie. DIRECTV has been pretty vocal about their desire to merge with DISH. So what are your thoughts about a potential transaction? And do you think this would be more difficult with a Democratic administration versus Republican?","Charles W. Ergen","I don't know. It's pretty -- I mean, obviously, it's one of the things that, I think, probably both companies have to consider. You've got a basically mature video business that's very competitive, with the power structure being more on the programming side than the distribution side, and then tremendous distribution coming -- almost unlimited distribution power coming from broadband and the Internet, which neither one of us have a lot of assets in, so I think it's something that probably both companies will look at. I don't think it would make -- if -- first of all, we're not having discussions about that. It's not an active thing. But I don't think either administration -- if a transaction made sense, I don't think either administration would block it if it made sense, if it was good for the American public. If it wasn't, both administrations would block it. So I don't think that really makes much difference. I think it's more a factor of, if you look at any transaction -- at least my experience with the government has been, any transaction that you look at, ultimately they weigh the effect on competition and innovation in the market. And they look at that -- every deal is different and they look at that in its totality. And if the deal makes sense, they approve it. And if it doesn't, they put conditions on it to make it make sense. Or if it really doesn't make sense, then they just don't approve it. And I'd leave that up to the experts, but I think it -- my personal opinion, it's probably a doable deal no matter who the administration is, under certain circumstances. And there's probably circumstances where it's not a doable deal.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Do you think the SiriusXM merger helps your case?","Charles W. Ergen","The which merger?","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The SiriusXM.","Charles W. Ergen","Oh, the Sirius. Yes, I mean -- I think every merger is different. But yes, that one is pretty much on point. That was a situation where 2 companies had -- and Joe can speak to this better than I can because he was there. But 2 companies who were in a relatively mature business, had tremendous competition kind of -- had competition from direct regular radio and had tremendous competition coming from iPads and -- I mean, iPhones and other forms of radio. So that one is close to on point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two wireless questions, one for Charlie and one for Tom. Charlie, there's some concern among analysts that DISH will end up investing a lot of capital on a wireless build-out. How should investors think about potential cost of any wireless build-out? And I guess I'll probably just go ahead and ask for Tom. I just imagine that you guys -- when you realize you'd win DBSD and TerreStar, you didn't think it'd be late 2012 before you had any visibility on terrestrial rights for that spectrum, right? So my point is, you've had a lot of time, probably more than you expected, to explore wireless business models and undertake discussions with potential partners. So the question is, how far along are these conversations with potential wireless partners at this point, given all the time that you've had?","Thomas A. Cullen","Hey, Doug. It's Tom. I'll comment on the second part. Obviously, this has taken longer than we had originally forecast. We continue to work with the FCC, and we'll see how that transpires over the next several weeks. As far as industry partnerships, I think we've been pretty public. And we've concluded we clearly aren't going to go this alone in a greenfield build. And the only way to put this spectrum to use effectively in a commercially viable way is through a partnership. So yes, we have had discussions with pretty much all of the players you would think would be natural partners for us. That being said, since October 1, we've seen 2 pretty significant announcements that would modify the landscape of the wireless industry in the U.S. You both -- you know what I'm talking about. Both the T-Mobile and the Metro merger as well as the Softbank intent to acquire 70% of Sprint puts us in a -- I would say, a delayed position in terms of meaningful conversations with those players as they pursue their own regulatory approval process.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. And this is Charlie. I think, just to add on what Tom said, I mean, obviously, we're disappointed in the delay in getting our license approved. I mean, obviously, it's gone on a lot longer than we -- everybody anticipated. Certainly, than we anticipated for a relatively noncontroversial -- and finally, there's lots of precedent in terms of what we're trying to do. So having said -- and obviously, the landscape has changed materially in the last -- with the Japanese coming into the market and obviously Deutsche Telekom with Metro. So we'll have to wait and see and we'll have to -- ultimately have to wait and see what the FCC decides and whether we have the technical flexibility to enter the marketplace. And as a new entrant against 4 very large incumbents, you can't -- you got to kind of -- the FCC, you would have liked them to have gone a little faster, but the Chairman has always said that it's going to be at the end of the year, and I think they'll probably do it by then. And you hope to get a technical flexibility so that you don't take away spectrum from us or give it to somebody who's already an incumbent, who has a lot of spectrum already. And you hope that they play it fair and down the middle and consistent with what they've done in past practices. If they do that, then we think there's a lot of opportunity for us in the marketplace. And we obviously have a large cash balance, and we're ready and willing to invest that in this business. If it makes sense and we have a high likelihood of success in that -- in the business plan, then we're going to do that. If we don't, then we're not going to do that. And we're not going to get in the business just to get in the business. We're going to get into a business because the FCC has allowed us, as a new entrant, to have the technical flexibility to get in the business that and that we find some -- we find people who are like-minded in where we want to go in terms of people who probably already are in the business in terms of partnerships. So I think you should -- I think investors shouldn't be concerned -- well, I shouldn't say -- I don't think you should be concerned. Based on our track record, we don't normally spend money unwisely and we don't normally take exuberant risk. So I think that we would be prudent about it. And I'm -- and I guess the way you should look at it and the way I look at it is I'm awfully glad that we have some optionality in the wireless space, because obviously we're in a mature business today and to grow our business -- I think the world has changed and video has gotten very competitive. And I think you have to redefine your business every 10 or 20 years, and I think we're in a position to do that. So I like where we are. And we'll just have to wait on the FCC and see whether they're giving us the flexibility to enter the business or not, or whether they're trying to take -- or whether they end up with rules to take spectrum away from us.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And sorry to take so long, but just a follow-up on the modification of the landscape. Has the change that's taken place recently impacted your plans at all, or what kind of returns do you think you can get out of the wireless business?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I guess the biggest impact is that Sprint kind of changed directions with the Softbank investment and takeover from Japan in the sense that they then went to FCC and became more aggressive on the H-Block, which is 5 megahertz adjacent to us, which is a guard band today and it's not used by anybody. There's no standard for the H-Block. There's no 3GPP, there's no chipsets for the H-Block. They've been very aggressive to try to limit -- to an unprecedented level limit our out-of-band emissions in our adjacent frequency. So that's been a little bit of a difference. And they've gotten very aggressive there. I don't think that the FCC -- and the FCC is taking a look at that, but I think -- at the end of the day, I don't think the FCC is going to take away 5 megahertz or render 5 megahertz of ours useless and give it the Japanese, who, with their Clearwire investment, has over 200 megahertz of spectrum. That just wouldn't make any sense if you really want a new entrant into the business. And so that's kind of the last -- I think that's the big thing to be decided. And I think that slowed things down because that became a very aggressive approach by Sprint. And you can just read the ex partes on our side and their side to get -- I don't want to get into long technical explanations about it, but the ultimate kind of decision is, do you take -- if you were to -- really an unprecedented decision and going against maybe 20 years of FCC precedent to take a band that we have today and suddenly restrict it by -- to us to 1\/500 of our power level to open up 5 megahertz that only Sprint could use just wouldn't make a lot of sense. But that doesn't stop a company from trying, and it certainly doesn't stop -- you just never know what happens in Washington, I guess, you'd say, I guess. But I think that common sense would -- we'd feel comfortable that, ultimately, the FCC will make the right decision there. And if they do, then I think we have the technical flexibility to move forward in the marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amy Yong from Macquarie.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Research","Charlie, can you talk about your plans and how you plan on creating value for the spectrum you'll receive from Cablevision? And then also can you just provide some details around the AMC programming contract and what kind of leverage, if you had at all, in the negotiations?","Charles W. Ergen","Okay. First, the spectrum that we're acquiring from Cablevision is kind of the mirror image. We own about half the country, and that particular spectrum is exactly the same spectrum we use for our DBS. So we go up to the satellite. So it's again spectrum that we think that could be -- we think can be used terrestrially because we use it for satellite today. And with the Cablevision spectrum, we'll own virtually all the United States. There's a few small areas that we won't own. And so we think that it has use. If we're able to enter the wireless business, we think it has a lot of strategic value with what we're trying to do in the wireless business. And it also provides some -- we also would be in a position to make sure that it doesn't interfere with what we and DIRECTV do today through satellites. So it's not too dissimilar than what we did with DBSD and TerreStar in the sense that it's spectrum that's already used for satellites that could be used terrestrial. We don't place a lot of value on it today. There's a lot of hoops we'd have the jump through and a lot of testing we have to do and which we're doing to -- there's a lot of creativity, I think, involved to be able to use it and some advances that you'll have to make in technology that we think are doable. And we'd have to be allowed to get into the wireless business. But all those -- if all those things happen, then we think that the spectrum could -- ultimately could have the -- a high value for us. As far as the settlement itself, I think that our analysis of it was, based on the judge's orders to the jury and stuff, that we really had no -- very little chance that the jury would side with us. It was pretty much a stacked deck against us, as normally -- as it normally is when you have this full application [ph] order. So I think that, with that said, we looked at it and said this settlement makes sense for us. We probably would have lost probably not the kind of amount of money they were asking for, but we would have been through an appeal process that would have gone on for 3 or 4 more years. And based on our experience in TiVo, we ended up about -- we ended up with TiVo where we probably could've ended up 5 years earlier, right, and we wasted a lot of time for lawyers and management time on something that probably could have been settled. And I think, from that -- based on that experience, we just decided that we didn't want to go into another 3- or 4-year appeal process where we'd probably end up about where we ended up. As far as AMC, Joe could speak to this more, but we probably would have had a positive quarter from net adds had we not taken down AMC. The product -- if AMC continues to produce shows like Walking Dead, which is kind of off the charts in terms of people viewing it, then that will be a fair deal for us. And if not, if they don't -- if they stub their toe, then we probably paid too much for their programming going forward. But it is an intermediate-term type agreement. And I know our programming folks have always liked the AMC folks and they get along pretty well. And I think we're now in their camp to try to help them as a partner be as successful as they possibly can. And absent the litigation, we probably never would have gotten to that point, but we are kind of are where we are. And I think, at the end of the day, our decision was that we needed to put the litigation behind us and focus on the real opportunity that we have in terms of building DISH Network and then also entering the wireless business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stefan Anninger of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Stefan Anninger - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have 2, and I'll keep them brief. The first one is just about your balance sheet. You have an awful lot of cash on your balance sheet at this point and also a fair amount of debt capacity. As you look forward and you think about partnering with another player, is it necessary to carry all that cash? Or are there better uses for it, for example, perhaps a dividend? And then my second question is about Clearwire's spectrum at 2.5 gigahertz. As you look at that spectrum and the opportunities on that spectrum, what opportunities do you see there? Clearly, Sprint sees an opportunity there, perhaps, with the new investment. How do you view that spectrum as an opportunity going forward perhaps for you?","Charles W. Ergen","Do you want to take the balance sheet question, Robert?","Robert E. Olson","Oh, sure. So, Stefan, it's true, we did have a lot of cash on our balance sheet. And as you know, we've historically been pretty lightly levered in terms of our borrowing capacity. We've talked to this question probably almost every call, which is we -- as a company and in conjunction with our board, we discuss options for our cash. And obviously, one of those options is to reinvest in the business. Another option is, as you pointed out, to pay a dividend. And so we -- and we've talked, on previous calls, about one factor that we obviously keep an eye on is tax policy. So all of those factors are being evaluated. And at the end of the day, we're just simply trying to do the best thing for the shareholder.","Thomas A. Cullen","Stefan, this is Tom. Regarding Clearwire's spectrum or, frankly, any other spectrum, to us, that's a second-order consideration. We first need to understand the starting point of where we are with the S-band and what the conditions would be for us to enter this market through a partnership. We're obviously cognizant of moves that have taken place since mid-October, when Softbank moved on Sprint. And then subsequently, Sprint moved to take control of Clearwire, so that's now theirs to control. And we know that Softbank has aspirations, apparently, for that spectrum, as they use it in Japan. And we're -- we understand the capabilities of the spectrum, but as I said at the beginning, we really have to understand where we are on the first investment we've made before we can consider options to move in other directions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet from Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Thomas, on sort of the applicability of the Sky Angel sort of proceedings going on at the FCC, is that relevant to you at all in terms of how that plays out?","Thomas A. Cullen","Okay. I think -- I don't know if everybody heard that, but the question was about the Sky Angel proceeding at the FCC and whether that was relevant. The answer is yes, it is relevant in the sense that what Sky Angel has done is they're basically claiming to have IPTV over-the-top rights because they had some rights to broadcast it via satellite and because they are -- they believe they're defined as an MVPD. And so that would have relevant -- that proceeding would have relevance to all of the MVPD players and potentially people who aren't in the business today if the definition were to change or if Sky Angel were to prevail. So it's worth watching, and predicting outcomes is -- in Washington is a difficult game, so -- but as usual, they will pick winners and losers on that and somebody will win and somebody will lose.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Am I right in sort of -- if the FCC rules in favor of Sky Angel, it could bring on more competition. But it is not reasonable to assume that it could dramatically lower your SAC costs and raise your cash flow by a substantial amount? Or is that misguided?","Thomas A. Cullen","Well, I think there'll be a lot of unintended consequences from that, and some would be good. And like you said, I think SAC -- I think there probably would be potentially more competition. I think that potential already exists today. So I'm not sure that it -- but it just may go a little faster. And I think it may -- it would change some dynamics for certain homes where SAC would be less, or things you could do with the programming would be different. I mean, I think, from a big picture perspective, the industry is struggling with, how do you take a market that's extremely profitable for the content owners today and where it's pretty much fully distributed to 90% of the kind of homes in the United States -- and do you want to change that model into a different paradigm of over-the-top IPTV, potentially with new entrants, where short term you might be able to get some added revenue, but you ultimately would affect the revenue that you get from the current people who built that infrastructure and are your current partners? So how do you do that? And so you see programmers struggle with what they -- the owners of Hulu struggle with how they do that, as you saw Starz struggle with how to do that with Netflix. And each of those -- each -- I think each of those programmers will come to -- perhaps, there could be some different conclusions, but it looks like the industry right now is focused on kind of a win-win situation for the current environment, which is authentication, which means as long as you pay me for your programming today, then you can -- that you get more flexibility in how you can watch that programming, both inside the home and perhaps outside the home. And so I think we have to -- we keep our eye on that. We continue to look at technologies and companies that are involved in over-the-top transmissions and -- but that -- we're a small player in the distribution side of it, and the content owners are ultimately going to decide what's the best strategy for them. And I guess Sky Angel is just one really small piece of that in terms of that decision. I think the other decisions are, I think, like Aereo -- is it Aereo or Aereo -- the -- can you put over-the-top -- can you put broadcasting networks over-the-top? That's a big decision too, where they -- we were -- initially had won the initial battle. And whether they win the war or not is another question. But if that were to happen, that would be pretty dramatic change in the way the business runs, at least for local networks, because you certainly would have -- you certainly would have retransmission consent agreements go away or come down a lot in terms of price.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with Sanford Bernstein.","Craig Moffett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I want to return to something Joe said in the intro remarks where, Joe, you talked about slowing subscriber growth or little or no subscriber growth and rising programming costs being a recipe for contracting margins. How do you think about that? I mean, how do you think about what you do about that? Obviously, you suggested that your wireless strategy is part of the solution, but can you say more about how it's part of the solution? And have you gravitated more toward a fixed wireless broadband network, as opposed to full mobility, because of that? I'm wondering if you can just elaborate a little bit on that commentary.","Charles W. Ergen","Craig, I think -- this is Charlie and I'll take it a little bit. I mean, I think that -- look, we're not -- we don't put our heads in the sand. I mean, I think, when you don't raise your price and you've got programming costs that go up that -- according to industry statistics of 6% to 10% a year, your margins are going to contract. So what can you do about it? There's really 2 things you can do. One is you can improve your product and make sure it's a better product. And I think that Joe and his team have done a pretty good job with the Hopper in terms of making a really great product that, as soon as people understand it, they -- it would be the product of choice. It is the best set-top box kind of user interface system in the business today. A second thing, I think, you can do is you can start taking things like authentication and things that you have -- that most people have the rights to today and make sure that we give customers a better experience both inside and outside their home. And of course, we do that with Sling outside the home. So you continue to make a better product and you compete. And I think that our subscriber losses are less than most in this industry, and I think we're better positioned kind of going forward to maintain where we are. And of course, the third thing is we have the ability to raise price next year because we didn't raise price this year. So we have a pretty good path to increasing our margins, although we have to be prepared for that fact that, any time you raise price, you give customers a reason to look elsewhere. So all those factors considered, I think the core business is pretty good stable -- in pretty good shape. The wireless side of it gives you another opportunity for a lot of reasons. It gives you another opportunity for another revenue model, whether that be fixed broadband or whether that be -- or fixed wireless or whether it be mobile wireless? Obviously, you'd -- fixed wireless probably doesn't work in a lot of parts of the country economically, but mobile broadband's -- but mobile wireless certainly does. You have another chance to go to a customer and get another revenue stream. You also have a chance to give them a customer experience that's similar to what they get in the home at a quality of service that you can control. So it gives you a lot of reasons why somebody might want DISH Network and they can take their TV with them everywhere and get a quality of service that they otherwise couldn't get, and one bill that takes care of their fixed and mobile needs. So in certain parts of the country, you'd be more competitive than others. And so we like the optionality that we have now. It's really -- it's been frustrating. I mean, I would have liked to been sitting on a conference call at the beginning of this year, telling you exactly kind of how we'd see ourselves going forward. So it's been excruciatingly slow in terms of getting to where we need to get to, but I think we'll have decisions in the -- before the end of the year. And then I think, give us 30 days once we get decisions for us to say, \"Okay, now based on all that data, here's where we think we're going to go.\" And so I'm hopeful that the next time, our next quarter conference call, we'll be able to give you some real insight into kind of the direction we think we're going. I -- the only thing you can do strategically is put yourself in position that if certain things happen, you can take advantage of that. And I think we've done that. And I think that we have half a dozen options of where we want to go as a company, and I hope that all those options will be good for our shareholders. So -- and that's a much better situation than sitting here -- if we just sat here with a video business, with satellite and that's all we had, you'd have -- you might have only one option going forward. And it's probably good for shareholders, but it'd probably only have one option. And so I'd rather have multiple options because then you can pick the best one that has the highest return.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two, if I may. First, to follow up, Charlie, on the spectrum side. You mentioned in your Q the potential for a shift in that band. And in the filings in the past, you talked about a delay as long, as I believe, 18 months. How do you minimize that delay? Can you work with vendors today and work with the standards bodies today to start getting ready for that potential?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, I -- the shift you're talking about is that -- if you could free up the H-band spectrum to be usable, that would be a good thing, right? We'd all like to do that, right, because it would increase another 5 megahertz spectrum for a country that's low on spectrum. And one way that we looked at that with the FCC and all the technical people and with the government is to shift 5 megahertz of us up to -- our low band up 5 megahertz. The ultimate conclusion that everyone has come to is that, that doesn't help because the shift would be interfered by other government users. And so there would be -- that shift would not increase 5 megahertz of spectrum. So the other -- so that doesn't look like it's going to work. So then you're back to, do we have to stay where we are? And by the way, if we did shift, it would delay us somewhere between a year or 2 at the 3GPP conference and delay us getting in the marketplace, which would be in a -- which would probably be a deathblow to what we're trying to do. The next -- so then you go back to, can you somehow make H-block work in the current environment? We've offered through our discussions, and obviously, you can read about those in our filings, is we believe that H-block could be used at low power for femtocells and small cells and it could be used. And it could have value and it could be used. Sprint has come in now with Softbank in a different discussion in terms of saying, \"No, we want to protect it for full power.\" But in doing that, the result -- cutting through all the technical stuff and cutting through all the mumbo-jumbo, the result of that would be to render 5 megahertz of our spectrum useless so that the net effect would be to take away 5 megahertz from us and give 5 megahertz to Sprint, who would be the only likely bidder on the H-block because it's adjacent to where they are. So -- and you'd have to go against years of FCC precedent to take a band that is unused today and suddenly protect it by imposing incredible power limits that -- on us that really haven't been done before on a usable band. The second thing that would happen is that, if the H-block would have to go through the 3GPP process itself, and so it's undetermined whether you'd ever be able to use the H-block and it's undetermined whether you'd ever get much of a spectrum value from it because there'd only be one bidder and -- likely bidder in Sprint-Softbank. And then you'd get asked the question, should Sprint, with their Clearwire at -- now control of Clearwire, gives them, I think, 250 megahertz of spectrum. Would -- do you need to give them 5 megahertz more spectrum and take away 5 megahertz from the new entrant who would essentially have 40 megahertz of spectrum? So I don't think that's a practical outcome, but that certainly is worth looking at and making sure that we should look at every way that H-block could be used, and I think we've offered real practical solutions to that. We certainly would bid in an auction for low power, as I would think others would bid, because it would be usable for what we really need, which is more capacity in the cities. So that's the -- that's kind of where the discussions -- or I think the discussions are going on today, is between the staff and the FCC. And ultimately, the Chairman has to decide, and he has to decide. I hate to say it again, but the government does pick winners and losers. Would they pick Sprint as a winner over a new entrant? Maybe, but I would hope not.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then second, if I may. Robert, you had a pretty big working capital drawdown this quarter. How should we think about that in terms of being temporary and reversing in the fourth quarter? Or is that pretty sustainable from here?","Robert E. Olson","Well, Phil, as we discussed, I would expect free cash flow being negative in the fourth quarter because of the VOOM litigation. Over the last couple of years, we've had favorable working capital because our cash taxes have been less than our book taxes. This is -- we've -- over those years, we've benefited from bonus depreciation, clearly. Going forward, it's -- well, it's -- quite frankly, it's unclear what the situation will be in Washington, whether bonus depreciation will continue in some form or another. But we continue to work very hard on really all elements of working capital. I think we have some room to improve inventory over the next year. We've been a little bit high on inventory as we've made the transition to the Hopper. Once that stabilizes, we've got some opportunities there. So without giving you a direct forecast quarter by quarter, in general, we manage working capital pretty tightly, and we think we can do a pretty good job going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Barclays.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Regarding AutoHop, I know you're in litigation on this, but if we assume that your right to offer the service is sustained in the court, what do you think the impact this has on broadcast economics? Do you think that this fundamentally, over time, makes ad viewership lower and then broadcasting becomes a less profitable business? Or do you think the balloon gets squeezed and we see it, the dollars, emerging in affiliate fees instead?","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. I think I'll take that one. I think that you've seen a couple of programmer -- broadcasters talk about the fact that the DVR is their friend. And Hopper is just a better operating DVR in the sense that people watch more of their shows and they don't all skip -- about half of them skip commercials. So if you get more people watching, then you still have -- you have half the people -- the dirty secret is half the people skip commercials whether it's the Hopper or somebody else's. We just allow you to do it with a push of the one button. Somebody else makes you push a button 3 or 4 times. So I think that it's unclear, other than I think I -- other than the data seems to show and the broadcasters seem to say recently that the DVR is actually a positive for them in terms of more viewership that maybe is not being measured today and the fact that only about half the people actually skip commercials, and net-net, they come out ahead. Having said all that, I think that, ultimately, the broadcasters are in fact our partners. We're not going to go out there and try to do something that would be -- at least knowingly, we wouldn't go do something that would be very harmful to their total economic model because, ultimately, as you say, it would show up in other forms. And we want -- obviously, broadcaster's content is something our customers want. So I think there's other things you can do. If you -- once the litigation is over, where you're actually working together to say, \"How can we do the kind of things where, as an example, we can target ads to customers, so they're not -- so people don't want to skip them, and do it in a way that customers feel better about and want to watch more commercials?\" And you make them better and we can have viewer measurement as to what works and what doesn't work, in that you have more of partnership agreement where -- with the programmers so that you can do things that make sense for both companies. But we're going to have to get through the litigation first before we get there. I mean, I think, again, this is -- we don't always take principled stands, but the fact of the matter is we believe the American public has the right to change the channel. We think they have the right to record a show, and we think they have the right to push a button to skip a commercial because not all commercials are intended -- I don't want my family -- certainly when my kids were young, I didn't watch -- want them watching all those commercials. Some are very offensive. So I think you have to have the right to skip the commercial. And I think that's where we differ today. And we think the broadcasters, at least in the lawsuit, have said, \"No, customers don't have the right to do that.\" And I think we have to take a stand for the consumer, because if we don't, nobody else is going to do it. So I think it's one of the things what customers like about DISH.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore Partners.","Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I had 2 questions, one on ARPU. Can you just talk about whether the sequential ARPU decline was also driven by increased credits issued to customers during the AMC dispute and the other programming disputes? I know you mentioned pay-per-view was a driver, but was wondering if this was also a factor. And then secondly, what kind of traction have you gotten in selling the Blockbuster digital and DVD-by-mail service into the DBS subscriber base? I mean, has this strategy worked at all? And if you strip out the financial impact of the stores, what does the digital and DVD-by-mail business look like? How big is it? Is it profitable? If you could you talk about that, it'd be great.","Robert E. Olson","Bryan, this is Robert. I'll address your question on ARPU. The majority of the sequential decline in ARPU was indeed driven by pay-per-view events, as I mentioned. There was a small impact, clearly, due to waivers and adjustments associated with the AMC dispute. However, once again, the majority of that was just seasonality and really the lack of major boxing events in the third quarter. With regard to the question on Blockbuster, we offer the Blockbuster @Home product to new customers. And what we've seen with that offer is it's very similar to the take rates on premium channels. So we offer it for a few months to new customers. Some of them decide to continue, some don't, but the performance of those customers and the performance of that product is very similar to what we see on premium channels.","Thomas A. Cullen","And just on the Blockbuster By Mail piece -- it's an element of the Blockbuster @Home, and about 1\/3 of the customers utilize that service.","R.

Clayton","Thanks, Jason, and good afternoon to those of you on the East Coast, and good morning to our West Coast participants. Now I've been serving as the DISH CEO for a little over 10 months now. And early on, I was pleasantly surprised at how solid the fundamentals were here at DISH. We're fortunate to have an outstanding operations team headed by our Chief Operating Officer, Bernie Han, and we also have an excellent financial organization led by our CFO, Robert Olson. So I saw my assignment as significantly improving our marketing and sales efforts. Thus, I've been focused on developing a customer-focused transformation here at DISH. Now I spent the first 6 months working on identifying the weak areas, powering new leaders for key positions, setting specific objectives, developing the strategy or game plan, establishing key performance metrics and defining a time line for completion. That was Phase I of our transformation. The balance of my time was spent communicating our new DISH Customer First vision to our key constituents: programming partners, distributors, key retailers, employees across the country, DISH customers, the press and yes, even Wall Street. ","Since the January CES show, DISH has taken the following actions: reorganized our management structure with the greatest change coming in the marketing and sales areas. For example, we have realigned our sales efforts by segmenting our business into 6 distinct channels of distribution: TVRO or independent retailers, national accounts, telecommunications, independent direct sales marketeers, commercial accounts or B2B and our own DISH direct sales. All channels are headed by experienced, energetic, intelligent and sales-savvy vice presidents. The entire senior marketing team has also been reorganized. And just last month, we hired an experienced communications professional as CMO, James Moorhead. Now James is no stranger to business and brand transformations. He joins us from Proctor & Gamble, where he oversaw the reenergizing of the Old Spice brand. ","And we've launched new products, the Hopper and Joey, the industry's most innovative whole-home HD DVR solution. We've developed new promotions like Blockbuster @Home, which has a step-up selling focus and it has an unequaled programming consumer offer. We've created exciting national advertising with our new ad agency, BFG9000. It has significantly enhanced our brand image and is resonating with the buying public. Our creative message highlights our unique product attributes like PrimeTime Anytime and over 2,000 hours of storage capacity. These are features that others cannot match. We've developed a simplified but elegant new brand treatment for DISH. We've established new corporate partnerships with SIRIUS XM and Univision. We've expanded our commercial focus on the Hispanic market. We have completed the transition to a new billing system. We've designed and launched a new website and we've even introduced new corporate mascots, Hopper and Joey. Yes, we have indeed been busy. ","Now I'm going to give you a progress report in a few minutes. But first, I want to update you all on 2 important corporate initiatives. First, Blockbuster. In terms of this business, we reported $14 million in operating income for the first quarter. This included the financial impact of closing roughly 500 domestic stores, which we discussed on our last call. Going forward, we'll monitor the performance of our remaining stores closely as we go forward. Now in addition, we'll continue to experiment with different marketing and merchandising ideas and we'll introduce new products, which you'll hear more about in the coming months. Just 2 weeks ago, we announced that we would move the Blockbuster corporate headquarters to Denver. This will be completed by the end of the second quarter. We can then leverage the strengths and capabilities of DISH across the entire Blockbuster enterprise. We've also put in place a Blockbuster senior management team, which brings a great deal of retail experience to our commercial efforts. That's Blockbuster. ","Now let me give you a quick review on our wireless assets. As you know, in mid-March, we closed our acquisitions of the reorganized DBSD and substantially all of the assets of TerreStar, making DISH the licensee of a large swath of spectrum, 40 megahertz largely unused. The FCC subsequently issued a notice of proposed rule-making and then published its proposed new rules. This would effectively re-band our MSS spectrum into AWS spectrum, thus potentially allowing for terrestrial-only wireless services. These rules were written to free up new capacity for mobile broadband, which will also help solve our nation's spectrum crunch, plus it will also allow for new competition in the marketplace. We look forward to working with the FCC through this rule-making process. Charlie and Tom will be available to answer any of your wireless questions at the end of our presentation. ","So let's move on to the first quarter highlights. I'll let you all be the judge as to whether we're making progress on our DISH transformation. First, we continue to grow. Our first quarter net subscriber additions were the highest they've been in 2 years. We gained over 100,000 net new customers in a difficult, competitive and economic environment. We ended the quarter over the 14 million mark. ","Other items of note were churn came in at 1.35%, the best performance in many years. Some of this can be attributed to our not raising prices in the first quarter as all competitors did, something that clearly resonated with customers. Our customer satisfaction measurements improved. We successfully converted to a new advance billing platform, one of the greatest operational accomplishments in the history of our company. And with the successful product launch of our new whole-home HD DVR, the Hopper and Joey, our broadband connectivity rates are trending up as well. So all signs indicate that our DISH transformation is moving in the right direction, but there is still a lot more work to do. ","Now let me tell you all a little more about some of our key initiatives. Again, we successfully launched our award-winning Hopper, the satellite industry's smallest most energy efficient and feature-laden whole-home HD DVR. Along with Hopper's sidekick, the Joey, a lightweight easy-to-hide companion for multiple-room usage. This groundbreaking product with its PrimeTime Anytime feature and massive 2-terabyte hard drive is proving to be a winner with consumers. Hopper has also been instrumental in reenergizing our brand. Now we only had 2 weeks of Hopper sales in the quarter. The new activation sales and existing customer upgrades are meeting our initial sales expectations. Consistent with our new brand focus on variety, innovation and value, our Hopper launch was supported by a product-oriented national advertising campaign, featuring the lovable Boston guys. America's now beginning a love affair with the Hopper, and you can expect to see more product-focused advertising spots in the future. ","Next, we continue to see success with our Blockbuster @Home promotion. We believe that this content package is a superior product value for DISH subscribers. In the first quarter, Blockbuster @Home had a positive impact on our sales mix. Our step-up selling strategy gained momentum as we improved our sales of our higher-margin America's top 200 and 250 programming packages. ","Moving to operations. As I mentioned earlier, we successfully completed our billing system conversion on March 31. This was a major milestone for DISH. It was a 2-year effort that also included implementation of a new workforce management system, a new IVR platform and a new data center in Cheyenne, Wyoming. These systems are the heart of our operations, and this overhaul will greatly improve how we serve our customers through increased flexibility and speed to market. This Herculean effort was headed by our SVP of Information Technology, Michael McClaskey, job well done. So as you can see from our recent management and business changes, we're going to great lengths to set ourselves apart from our competitors. ","Internally, we like to refer to our differentiation efforts as more music, more movies and more magic. It is our goal to offer much more than the pay-TV competition. This is the course that our DISH transformation has embarked upon. ","Now to provide you all with greater details on our financial performance, here's our CFO, Robert Olson.","Robert E. Olson","Thank you. As Joe described, first quarter results were generally in line with our expectations. We're pleased with our churn rate of 1.35% for the quarter, which was 12 basis points better year-over-year. Some of this improvement obviously was driven by the fact that we did not increase programming prices in the first quarter this year. ","Subscriber-related revenue increased by roughly 1% year-over-year in the first quarter. Profit was up 1.8% year-over-year but down slightly versus fourth quarter. As we discussed on our last earnings call, both pay-per-view revenue and advertising revenue tend to be seasonally lower in the first quarter than the fourth quarter. We expect these areas to rebound in the second quarter. Total company revenue increased by 11% year-over-year in the first quarter, largely driven by the incorporation of Blockbuster into our results and our price increase last year. Subscriber-related expenses increased by 4.1% in the quarter versus last year. We had a slight reduction in variable cost as we continue to drive process improvements in operations. However, these variable cost reductions were more than offset by higher programming expenses. The increase in programming costs was driven by contractual rate increases. ","Total cost of sales increased year-over-year as first quarter 2011 did not include Blockbuster's results. As Joe mentioned, we closed roughly 500 Blockbuster domestic stores in the first quarter. We generally liquidated the inventory for these stores at prices above their book value. As a result, Blockbuster was able to generate slightly higher income in the first quarter relative to prior periods. As we discussed previously, with the majority of the stores that were closed, we negotiated early termination provisions in the leases. Therefore, shutdown costs associated with these stores were not material to our results. We remain focused on keeping the business above breakeven, while we experiment with new marketing ideas, both integrated with the pay-TV business and stand-alone.","Our SAC for the quarter was $751, which was down versus recent quarters, but up 3.6% compared to first quarter 2011. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher advertising in the quarter associated with the Hopper launch, partially offset by the deployment of a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers. Keep in mind that we only had 2 weeks of Hopper sales in the first quarter. We expect SAC to increase slightly some next quarter when we have an entire quarter of Hopper equipment sales. While administrative expenses overall were impacted by the Blockbuster acquisition, G&A expenses for the DISH pay-TV business were largely consistent with recent trends. ","Net income was down 34% in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. There were several one-time items, which distorted that year-over-year comparison. Obviously, the largest item was the $341 million litigation accrual reversal associated with the TiVo settlement that occurred last year. This quarter, we had a $99 million gain in other income associated with the conversion of our DBSD senior secured notes upon completion of this transaction in March. We also had $14 million of noncash stock-based compensation this quarter driven by the stock option adjustment, which was made in connection with the $2 dividend we paid. This stock option adjustment had previously been disclosed in our 10-K filing in February. ","Finally, with the closing of the DBSD and TerreStar transactions, we have broken out a separate wireless spectrum segment in our financial data. These transactions closed on March 9, but we only consolidated 22 days of results in the first quarter. ","We generated $690 million of free cash flow in the quarter due to the timing of estimated tax payments and cash taxes were far less than book taxes in the quarter. For the remainder of the year, we expect cash taxes and book taxes to be in the same general range. However, that will vary by quarter, and second quarter cash taxes are expected to be higher than book taxes. Cash flow was also helped in the first quarter by a $37 million reduction in inventory, which was partially driven by the Blockbuster store closings. Finally, we continue to control capital spending, with first quarter expenditures under $170 million. ","There are 2 major changes on the balance sheet versus last quarter. First, we allocated the TerreStar and DBSD assets to the specific balance sheet accounts, predominantly the property and equipment line and the FCC authorization line. Second, the strong cash flow performance in the quarter increased our cash balance from roughly $600 million at year end to slightly over $1.3 billion as of March 31. ","Let me now turn it back to Joe before we start Q&A.","Joseph P. Clayton","Thanks, Robert. I believe that today's first quarter results clearly show that we have made progress. Unquestionably, there is much more work to do. There will be ups and downs as we move forward, but we are committed to improving our DISH business approach with the right people, the right programming, the right product, the right promotions, the right advertising and the right customer care. ","Thanks for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. Now we'll open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Moffett from Sanford Bernstein.","Craig Moffett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two questions if I could. Charlie, first, with respect to your wireless strategy, would you say your interest in further spectrum acquisition at this point is fully satisfied? Or would you have interest in longer-term spectrum plays like LightSquared, for example, in its bankruptcy? And then second, if you could just comment on the litigation with AMC and your decision not to carry AMC going forward at their asked-for prices. I know you said those 2 things are unrelated, but if you could just comment on those 2 things.","Charles W. Ergen","Okay. I think I'll start with AMC. Maybe Joe will jump in here. But the -- we have very, very specific viewer measurement here, much more granular than somebody like Nielsen would have. And so we're able to watch our customer base and realize we skew a bit more rural, and so we just don't -- if you look at the Rainbow programming, they are very low -- a very, very, very low viewership outside of a few, obviously, popular channels on AMC. Those particular channels are also available to our customers through a variety of other sources like iTunes, Amazon and Netflix and so forth and so on. So one of the things that programmers have done is they've devalued their programming content by making it available in many multiple outlets. And so when someone asks for pricing -- I mean, and we just have to be up at the end of our contract, so the -- we look at it. Our customers are not really saying, \"We want to pay more money.\" They're saying, \"We want more flexibility in our programming and we don't want to pay more.\" And so when you look at that from a timing perspective, that's just a contract that we can change and we believe that the product has actually been devalued. And not that it's not good -- not that there's not some good programs, but it's been devalued because you can get it multiple ways and customers are asking for more flexibility or have more flexibility to get the programming, so it's not quite the same if something was exclusive. And so we look at that and say, \"This is a good opportunity to make a good business judgment call.\" I mean, obviously, there's a price where a Rainbow product makes sense. We just don't think that's where we are today. And Joe, do you have anything to add to that?","Joseph P. Clayton","No, I mean, we're facing situations where we want to reduce programming costs and the programming providers are raising them. So they're going the exact opposite way. So we're trying to find the right balance here.","Charles W. Ergen","That'll be really interesting because it's easy to make a short-term gain by -- I think all MVPD customers -- I mean, companies are going to take a look at this. We're not going to be the last one to take a look at these kind of issues. And when you're in a marketplace when typically, most customers have 4 providers to choose from who all sell exactly the same thing, there's probably going to be some breakout of one or more companies offering something a little bit different, at little different prices, so the customers have a bit more of a choice. And that may be disruptive short term, but maybe not -- maybe a chance to gain market share long term. So a lot of things can go on, and I think over the next year or so in the programming side, we just made a decision based on real data from our customers. On the wireless side, I guess I'd answer it from a big picture perspective, which is our focus right now is really on getting the FCC approval. We own about 6 megahertz for most of the country today and 700 megahertz. There's 40 megahertz at stake here. That would give us about 45 megahertz nationwide, and that's enough to get business. And obviously, that rule-making now is in front of the FCC. We're disappointed that we didn't get the waiver to enter the business today. But we'll certainly work with the FCC to get the rule-making done as fast as possible. It would allow us to enter the business. Long term, I think that there's only 2 companies that are well positioned spectrum-wise for the long haul, and that's AT&T and Verizon. Verizon, even better, potentially even better if they are able to purchase a cable spectrum. So I think that long term, I think you're going to have to have -- for people to compete, they're going to have to have spectrum, but there's a variety. Hopefully, there'll be new spectrum coming on the market. Hopefully, there'll be other ways to make spectrum more efficient. And we certainly think that if we're allowed to enter the marketplace, our 45-megahertz spectrum is certainly enough to enter the marketplace and compete.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Jayant from ISI Group.","Vijay A. Jayant - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on the Blockbuster @Home, can you give us any sense on how that product take-up has been for folks that can choose it? Not as part of the ATC top 200 where it comes as part of it. So on a stand-alone basis, have people chosen that product and if there's any subscriber churn on that? And second, as you mentioned, the programming costs were a little higher this quarter and there's some changes you're making. But can you talk about just retention strategy today on your subscriber base when you have 14,000,000 subscribers and obviously, churn improved. Was there really any increase on retention spend at all?","Robert E. Olson","Vijay, this is Robert. I'll take the first question and then Bernie Han will take the second question on retention. The Blockbuster @Home package has performed very similar to our premium movie channel packages. When we offer it during a promotional period for new customers, we get a relatively high take rate. When the promotional period -- when the promotional period rolls off, some of those customers drop off, but a good number of them stay, and so we look at that curve being very similar to premium movie channels. Keep in mind that the Blockbuster @Home package was first launched in October. At that time, customers got either 3 months or 12 months promotional period depending on their programming package. We've since moved to a 3-month promotional period for all customers. And so we have limited data at this point, but everything we've seen says it's tracking very closely to premium movie channels.","Bernard L. Han","Okay, with respect to churn, what we've been trying to do for the last year or so is not only get our churn improved, which we have over the last few quarters, but also to do so by spending -- while at the same time spending less money, and we've been successful at doing that for the last 2 quarters at least. This quarter, as Joe and Robert alluded to, our churn was helped out pretty materially by not having a price increase occur this year. It would normally occur in the month of February. We've done a lot besides that to try to improve churn without spending more money, things like coordinating our efforts on the retention side with customer service. There's a lot of synergies as it turns out between those 2 functions. We're spending more on reactive treatments rather than proactive treatments with our customers. We're trying to make our customers simply just more aware of the things that are already provided as part of their programming packages that already come with what they already pay for rather than trying to give them more. So all of those are helping with us reducing churn, at the same time, spending less money. But again, in this quarter, the lack of price increases probably had the biggest impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. Charlie, first, in the wireless area, anything that you've seen during the FCC comment period so far of concern? And we've been hearing from companies that are meeting with DISH regarding you guys designing wireless network build out and service, and I was hoping you could share what you see is the biggest challenges, if any, for a wireless build out and potentially entering the wireless arena.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes. The comment period is -- initial comments, I think, are due early next week.","Robert E. Olson","May 17.","Charles W. Ergen","May 17, and the final comments June 1. So we don't have -- I don't think we've seen comments -- we won't see comments before then. They'd probably be fairly similar to the comments we saw in the DBSD-TerreStar merger comments and obviously, they centered -- the most important being centered around interference. We know it's a big topic in Washington. And again, in those comments, the government actually -- the GPS industry actually commented that we don't interfere within the GPS side of the business. So that's -- so I think that we'll have to wait and see what the comments are, but I don't think this is -- there's lot of surprises there. I think we've done a lot of homework in terms of the spectrum and in terms of the interference issues, and there's very little in the way of that. So I don't expect a lot on that side, but we'll have to wait and see. Obviously, the focus is -- Tom and I and our team, really, is focused on 2 things. One is, today, we came here in the business today with a dual-mode handset, and we've built dual-mode-host handsets in the past and have some available for sale today. But we're moving ahead very rapidly on the second-generation, dual-mode handset that would work both directionally, and make a link to the satellite. That we're allowed to do today. And then we're hopeful that the FCC will restrict -- give us more flexibility and eliminate the need for all of our handsets to make a link to the satellite because that will obviously allow us to make a less expensive, more robust phone to compete against the other guys in the business. But in the meantime, we're doing what we can do, which is to continue with next generation. We're learning as much as we possibly can about the business. And obviously, it's a very, very complex business, much more so than the satellite TV business and the MVPD business, so it's -- and the technology's changing very rapidly. So the good news is we've gotten up to speed and have a decent handle on it today, whereas, a year ago, we didn't know much about it. There's a lot of moving pieces didn't fit together. And finally, I'd say that we're talking -- and Tom, you may want to jump in on here. We're talking to a lot of people. We're talking to everybody out there that has some piece of the wireless business that we think can help us either as a vendor or a partner or a customer whether that be in the chipsets, the handsets, the towers and so forth and so on. Tom, you might want to just give a feel for the kind of things we're working on.","Thomas A. Cullen","Yes, Doug, it sounds like you've probably heard that from the community. We've been very active in meeting with the infrastructure providers, as well as other technology vendors in order to jump start the S-band ecosystem, which we're prepared to do. And we'll be moving -- you'll see some movement on that in the next couple of weeks. But however, it's all still predicated on the outcome of the FCC process. And so you may have seen that we met with the FCC last week and we've indicated to them that we want to try to work on a more reasonable build out schedule that allows for that time of development in terms of ecosystem development to support S-band, as well as using a reasonable milestone structure that would allow us to enter the market, provide something competitive and still allow us an acceptable return on capital, which is something that we'll focus on during the proceedings over the next month and beyond.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'll limit myself to one more, I guess, for Robert. The wireless results for 22 days suggest a run rate of $30 million or so losses per quarter. On the wireless business, is that what we should consider the run rate to be sort of this year?","Robert E. Olson","Doug, yes. The 22 days is roughly 1\/4 of a normal quarter. So I think that, that would be a good starting point just basically taking 4x our first quarter results. There will be little ups and downs as we go through, but we'll explain that on future earnings calls.","Thomas A. Cullen","Well, I'd also add to that, though, during those first few weeks, while we -- once we closed on the businesses, we combined the 2 organizations and rationalized their spending significantly. So there were severance payments and termination agreement -- or termination payments in those first few weeks, Doug, that wouldn't be projectable going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. The first, Robert, you touched on the increase in programming expenses, so how should we think about this particular line item for the rest of the year? And can we expect any change from an expense basis going forward now that the billing platform was finished at the end of the first quarter? And then my second question is for Charlie on the wireless asset. Is there a maximum amount of money you're willing to spend to monetize this spectrum? Because there's a view out there that should you go it alone on a network build, it will cost you upwards of $10 billion, and I'm curious as to your thoughts on this number and how you think about the return on a potential network build.","Robert E. Olson","Marci, this is Robert. I'll take your first question. I think our programming costs are quite similar to the other competitors in the industry. I think that we've talked about this being single digits, but certainly above inflation and that hasn't changed. It's currently above the inflation rate. Last year, we were very successful in offsetting those programming costs to some degree by reduction in variable cost. In the first quarter, year-over-year, we reduced variable costs further, but not by as much as we did last year. So I think that we will have pressure in that line and we'll continue to find ways to offset that. But first quarter is a good reflection of the challenges we face.","Charles W. Ergen","It's Charlie. I guess, I'd say it this way, that the wire -- that the real key for us will be how the FCC decides as to how we proceed in the business. But we look at the -- we look at that our strategy within wireless today has actually been very, very conservative. And those of you that have been an investor of ours for a long time, know we're very conservative in terms of management and how we do things. And I think you can expect us to be conservative in how we enter the wireless business as well, but that doesn't mean that you don't go out and do things. And certainly, our customers today, we're in a mature industry from a fixed video perspective, but certainly our customers are broadband customers and wireless customers from other companies and so it makes sense for us to tie all that altogether in one offering for our customers because it reduces churn and gives us a chance to enter new markets and certainly can increase our ARPU and our margin. So the cost of -- one of the nice things about wireless is there's not a programming cost there. The cost of air is not necessarily going up, but the cost of programming is. So it makes sense for us to diversify and get in the total fixed and wireless business. That's pretty conservative strategy quite frankly. There's a wide range of things we could do. We could build it alone on the one hand. And on the other hand, to the extent that we weren't allowed to get in the business, have enough flexibility, we could sell the asset. Neither one of those is likely -- is as likely because they're at the far end of extremes of what you might do. I think we're more than likely going to be somewhere in between that where we work -- assuming we get flexibility and enter the marketplace and assuming the timing to that is fairly quickly, obviously, there's a point in time when we just couldn't enter the marketplace because the market's passed us by. But assuming that the timing and flexibility are allowed, it probably makes sense to work with people who are already in the business. They already have towers. They already have relationships. They already have spectrum. They already have handsets. It makes sense to work with them because we bring something that makes the transition for them, particularly to LTE, much easier, so -- and we also bring video in a way that they may not be able to do themselves. So that's why, as Tom mentioned, we're certainly talking to everybody to see where this fits strategically with how we'd enter the marketplace and how we'd be competitive. But obviously, I'm happy to spend $10 billion if we can get a 50% return on it every year, right? I wouldn't be happy to spend $10 billion if we get a 3% return on it every year. So I think you can be rest assured that as a company, we're going to go spend our money where we think we'll get the greatest return. And that's one reason we spent almost $4 billion for spectrum as opposed to that same $4 billion in SAC to grow a business for a customer that doesn't generate as much return as they did 4 or 5 years ago. So everything for us is an economic analysis. We have realtime data. We have now great expertise in the video side of the business. We're developing great expertise in the wireless side of the business. And so I really -- I really am comfortable with where we are strategically. No matter what happens out there in the marketplace, there's going to be a lot of things that are going to happen over the next year. And I think like we -- I feel like we've positioned ourselves to kind of move based on things outside of our control, which at this point in time, is primarily with the government.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stefan Anninger from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Stefan Anninger - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was hoping you would discuss the moving parts that will impact potential for customer growth for the balance of the year. On the plus side, you have no price increase and the Hopper, of course. And then from a headwind perspective, you have DTV's decision to extend its free NFL SUNDAY TICKET promotion. So as you look out, how optimistic are you about being able to grow subs? And then if I just may slip in a related question, in the past, you've reduced marketing in some quarters when DTV has been out aggressively marketing attractive promotions. Would you consider doing that this year?","Joseph P. Clayton","This is Joe Clayton. I'll try to take that one, Stefan. One, we have a new product that we've just introduced in the marketplace that we think will resonate to the buying public, that we believe has greater features and capabilities than our competition. Two, we do not have the Sunday ticket, but we will also be bringing promotions to the party like Blockbuster @Home, and there will be additional promotions coming throughout the balance of the year that we think will also help stimulate sales. We are reenergizing our brand with a whole new creative strategy, if you will, that we think will indeed entice people to buy DISH products. And these spots and our advertising messaging will highlight the product attributes that we believe are better than what our competition has to offer. And in my prepared remarks, we talked about differentiation. It's our strategy to offer consumers what our competition does not have and to set ourselves apart and to help us sell a better mix of goods. So that's the roadmap that we're looking forward to in addition to greater customer service. And I think you'll see as the year goes on that we are making great strides here as well.","Charles W. Ergen","This is Charlie. I just want to add. I think there's a real misconception on the football, really, that we and others in the business had the red zone, and the red zone really shows every important play of every game. In HD, no commercials, no blackouts. And so we found that customers actually are finding out about we maybe haven't done as good a job marketing that product as we should and Joe is going to change that. But people -- we find a lot of people prefer that product and certainly less expensive, and I think that -- that one, I think, that I view the reduction of the season ticket price, obviously, is a strategy where the price just got too high and maybe the right fees and so forth and so on, and they now have to give away more programming. And whether reducing, cutting your cost in half is going to make more revenue for you, more profit remains to be seen, but my gut feels probably not. And I think that it's in part a reaction to the fact that the red zone, which shows all the games, all the important plays from every game is really a fantastic product. And for the vast majority of customers in football is actually a product that is maybe a better answer for them. And so since we have that product, I don't think that the season ticket is a big a deal as it maybe has been in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions. Charlie, maybe if we could pick up on the prior question about the FCC process. There's another process going on, on the cable side with Verizon Wireless. And I don't know if there's a direct relationship and you've always said you're 0 for whatever, 100 in DC, but I'd love to get your thoughts on how you see that playing out because on one hand having Verizon Wireless and cable partnered is a competitive issue for -- a potential competitive issue for your pay-TV business. On the other hand, if the FCC rules that they don't want Verizon to have more spectrum and they want to limit the big incumbents, AT&T and Verizon, from getting more that could have an impact on the flexibility, I think, you're looking for with MSS. So I'd love to hear any thoughts on that, and I have one follow-up just operational for Joe.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, well, obviously, I think Verizon's foray into the wireless and with the cable industry and then the marketing agreements, which we haven't seen un-redacted is cause for -- is potential cause for concern because obviously, you have 2 competitors who now are getting together potentially and tactically agree not to compete against each other. So that's really a question for the FCC and the Justice Department to take a look at and we haven't seen the details of those agreements. So we don't know whether there's concerns there or not, although on the surface, that certainly looks like something that's worthy of investigating. But it does -- it is going to be one of the key variables that will determine our ability to enter the business and whether we can be successful or not. I mean, obviously, the first and foremost is to have the FCC finish the rule-making as rapidly as possible, and we see no reason why that can't be done by the end of the summer. On June -- when June 1 comes, the comments are done and the FCC could rule any day after that. There's nothing to stop them from ruling the next day other than, obviously, there's a process where they got to read all the comments, respond to the comments, analyze the comments and prepare a rule-making. But obviously, that could be done in several months. It doesn't have to take several years to do that. And certainly, if that's a priority, as the President and the Chairman of FCC have said, then we'd be cautiously optimistic that would be done by the end of the summer. The Verizon cable deal could also be done this year perhaps, and that would be the other thing that would probably be -- would probably set the landscape for the wireless industry going forward. And obviously, that's not our focus today because we have our own issues to make sure that we can enter the business. But it makes a big difference and depending on how that goes, there's going to be -- the government picks winners and losers, as we all know. There's going to be haves and have-nots, and we just have to position ourself that no matter what happens, no matter what those results of our rule-making and the Verizon cable deal, no matter what happens there, that we can put this company in position to move in directions that would be beneficial to our shareholders. And I think I like where we are there. And we'll do our best to help the government make the best decisions they possibly can and make sure that we're articulating how we see the industry and the things that are important. And then these are bright people in government and they work hard. And in general, I think the FCC has gotten big decisions right, and I hope they get it right this time.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So is it fair to say that if they were to rule that Verizon Wireless accumulating additional AWS spectrum is not in the public interest of competition, that would be a concern for you as you think about your flexibility exiting this process?","Charles W. Ergen","No, I wouldn't say it that way. I'd have to see what the conclusion they came to and why they came to conclusion. But obviously, we're not approaching the kind of spectrum that Verizon has. Now having said that, Verizon realized and said that they may sell-off some spectrum, some less valuable A-band spectrum. So it really would be the conditions that are put on it if they were allowed to -- do they approve it with conditions or do they not approve it at all, we'd have to wait and see whether that -- how that changes the industry. But what -- the way you paraphrased it, it wouldn't necessarily be a concern. It could be, but it wouldn't necessarily be.","Thomas A. Cullen","Yes, Ben, this is Tom. I would say, well, first of all, we haven't taken a public position on the Verizon proceedings. Secondly, I think it is important to separate the competitive aspects of the proposed arrangement versus the spectrum acquisition. I think those are 2 very different things. And the backdrop to that, of course, is the demands on frequency and spectrum in this country are going nowhere but up. So our lens of how we look at spectrum holdings will have to evolve over time as well.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just, Joe, you've put a lot of operational pieces in place, the billing systems in place, the product launch. Should investors and shareholders look at the rest of this year as a way to measure the investments you're making and focus in on any single or couple of metrics for the business? I know you said last year, you weren't hired to sort of harvest cash flow, but to grow the business. You guys used to do 800,000-plus gross adds a quarter. It's maybe a different industry today, but maybe you could just help us think about what should we look at over the next 2 to 3 quarters to see if the investments are paying off?","Joseph P. Clayton","Well, I don't think our metrics that we focus on have changed at all. Quite honestly, I think we made progress in the fourth quarter and again, in the first quarter, but we do have to grow our net subscribers. We do have to keep our churn lower. We've got to make money in doing this and indeed, it's a work in progress. So we'll try to make improvements every single quarter. That's about all I can tell you. I don't think that what we focus on is any different than it was 6 months ago.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, this is Charlie. I mean, the macro trends are very competitive in this industry. I mean, I think we just saw something like 1.5 million less households watch -- in TV households in the last year. That's the first time since I can remember that TV households have actually gone down. You've got tremendous competition with most customers having 4 video providers or 4 choices for video, and you see heavy discounting of the product in the marketplace sometimes for the entire period of a 2-year contract. So you've got a very pretty interesting dynamic. Yet having said that, I think Joe and Bernie and Robert have put DISH in absolutely the best position. There's not any question that the Hopper is the best product in the marketplace, and can save customers money in terms of watching TV and give them a lot more choices, and it's very good for the broadcasters or that already shows that people watch more primetime television with the Hopper than they do with -- than our other units, which is good for the broadcasters, and it makes their product more valuable. So it really is the best product. The customer service metrics have been going up steadily over the last couple of years in terms of how we run our operations. And again, we'll have additional products. We hope more customers to purchase in the future from us and our customers -- our loyalty factor and our trust factor is going up with our customers. So I like where we're positioned. But how it goes quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month will be -- it's hard to really tell. But I feel like when we invest in a customer today, we can keep that customer long-term. I did -- I wasn't sure about that 2 years ago, and one of the reasons we were -- because we didn't -- we knew as a video-only company that, that was going to be challenging. And probably a negotiation every time somebody calls us on the phone, there's going to be a negotiation to how much discount you had to give them to have them stay with you. And I think now, we can just -- I think now, I feel confident we can just offer them a better product. And if you can offer somebody a better product, people will pay for a better product, and iPhone has shown that. And that's not the -- that's the most expensive phone in the marketplace, and yet people will pay for it because in their mind, it's a better product. And we're positioned to do that now with our product and strategically where we're going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi.","Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a question for Mr. Ergen. Assuming that you get a thumbs up from the FCC, what do you think is a reasonable amount of time before you could have a wireless product available in the marketplace?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, that would depend. It would take -- I would again -- to the extent that we're building a network from scratch, again, we think that that's probably a 4-year time frame to have a network up for a portion of the country. To the extent that you could partner with people already in the business, you could do it much sooner than that. Realize that the frequency we're using is not in the ecosystem today. So what's different about our build out than perhaps others is that we have to develop S-band chipsets and S-band handsets. And we're all ready to go on that, and we're risking some capital to do that today even without the FCC approving us into the marketplace because we know we can do it with the satellite. But part of the rule-making could potentially change our frequency for example. So how do you -- you can't really start fabricating the chipset when the frequency might change, but we've changed by the FCC. So we're just holding on. We're going to put everything in place we possibly can, but the long pole in the tent is going to be -- it's in development of chipsets and radios and handsets. And we're not going to know for sure what we can and can't do \u2019til that rule-making's final so -- but to the extent you partner with somebody, you can get in much quicker to the marketplace. So it could be as long as 4 years to have the initial -- in my opinion, and it could be much, much sooner than that to the extent that you work with somebody already in the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Wlodarczak from Pivotal Research.","Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","It's Jeff Wlodarczak. I just had 2 questions and a follow-up on churn. Other than typical seasonality, is there any reason that the sort of positive year-over-year churn trends that we saw this quarter should materially change over the course of 2012 unless there's a major change in the competitive environment? And then also on the closure of the 1\/3 of the Blockbuster stores, what kind of G&A run rate saving should we expect going forward from that?","Bernard L. Han","This is Bernie. With respect to the churn question, I think it's fair to use year-over-year or seasonality that we've seen in historical years as a starting point. I think that's a fair way to look at it. I think this quarter -- first quarter 2012, as we've talked about, we have an unusual benefit in terms of not having a price increase, which typically we do in most first quarters of past years. And besides that, we're trying to do things to continue and improve churn. We're starting to lap, however, the period last year, in which we started seeing some trend improvement. So I think all of those would factor into how you look at churn going forward.","Robert E. Olson","Jeff, this is Robert. On the Blockbuster question, first of all, you need to keep in mind that the Blockbuster International business is close to the same size as the domestic business. So 1\/3 of the domestic stores closing translates into a far smaller number overall of the Blockbuster business. In general though, I think that our focus on keeping the Blockbuster business at breakeven or better is what will continue. Obviously, the stores that we closed had the worst metrics in terms of G&A as a percent of revenue, in terms of operating margin. So that should help. On the other hand, we've talked in the past about having the benefit of purchase price accounting during the -- during most of 2011, and gradually rolling off through 2012. So all those things factor in. But consistent with my opening remarks, our focus is to keep experimenting, keeping the business at breakeven or above and taking action if we think it won't stay there.","Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","I'm just going to drop one more on you guys. Can you provide more color on the Charter co-marketing relationship? Are you seeing material gross adds in that partnership? And do you think there's opportunity to work with other maybe smaller, more mid-sized cable operators with a similar partnership?","Joseph P. Clayton","Well, once again, Charter has been the first cable company that we've worked with. We've looked at offering broadband services through a host of different other avenues, even with our own CenturyLink CLEC acquisition we made last year. So we're still looking at that either -- whether it's broadband by satellite, broadband through one of the cable providers, broadband through using the telco providers. We're open to, as long as it makes sense for financially and as long as it doesn't cannibalize our own subscriber base, we're open to that.","Jeffrey Duncan Wlodarczak - Pivotal Research Group LLC","Did you all see material adds from that channel this quarter?","Robert E. Olson","Yes, they probably weren't materialized. There were some adds, but not material.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","My first question is with regard to the segmentational channels, which Joe alluded to. So of those 6 channels that you mentioned, I just wanted to get a sense on whether your segmentation actually changes the way you would be marketing to the channels. And also, specifically with regard to the mobile and tablets, the test drive, if you can update us on that and whether you view that as a separate channel, that would be helpful. And also separately, any comment on early market launches of Verizon and Time Warner Cable or Comcast on the wireless bundle? Was wondering if you're seeing anything in those early markets.","Joseph P. Clayton","I'll take the distribution question. Of course, we will go to market differently within each channel segment. The 2 that are most alike is our independent direct sales marketeers and our own direct sales business. We use similar tactics, strategies like direct mail, lead generation in those channels. In terms of the TVRO industry and market, that's more product displays, different type of promotional offers. You move into national accounts, that too, we go to market differently. Telecommunications are promotions directly specified for each one of our partners, whether that be Frontier, Windstream, TBS and possibly, new partners going forward. And last, but not least, the commercial sales or B2B, that market is going through a transition just like residential market move from analog to digital over the last several years. The commercial market has not made that switch yet. They will be making that shift in the next 18 to 24 months, and that you need different technology and different programming packages. So every channel is different. And we have organized the business not only to have different sales leaders, but different marketing support for each channel.","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, I was going to say -- this is Charlie. On the second question, I don't think we've seen -- I think it's too early to know whether there's an impact. But obviously, these guys are bright guys and obviously, that's something we have to be aware of that obviously when you can bundle wireless with cable, that has potential to be a compelling product.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay, that's very helpful. Just a quick clarification on the -- I note that you still have a pending waiver request on the technical provisions separate from the integrated service and space satellite. I was wondering if that proceeding is going to be now subsumed by the rule-making process? Or if somehow, the outcome of that could have any material implications one way or the other. Just a quick clarification on that.","Thomas A. Cullen","Tuna, this is Tom. I would -- we're assuming that what wasn't -- we had a number of waiver requests out there. The primary waivers were denied, went to the rule-making, but the licenses were transferred. They specifically did not modify some of the secondary and tertiary waiver requests as part of the license transfer. But we would expect those to be addressed in the rule-making's final rules.","Operator","Your next question will come from James Ratcliffe from Barclays.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones if I could. First of all, on price, I mean, clearly, a part of the reason not to raise price in 1Q was because of the billing system transition. Now that that's successful, would you consider a price increase later in the year out of cycle, so to speak? And secondly, on working cap, we've highlighted inventory and the tax item. Is there anything else in there that led to that working cap gain?","Robert E. Olson","James, I'll take the second question first. Now that the change in working capital this quarter was largely due to taxes and due to inventory, keep in mind the last year's working capital was impacted by the TiVo announcement.","Joseph P. Clayton","And in terms of the price increase, specifically in regards to our programming packages, there are no plans in place at this particular point in time to increase the programming packages. But hardware and some other possibilities could possibly exist depending upon the environment, the economic environment.","Charles W. Ergen","Thanks. I guess we'll be back in August. I may or may not be on that call. But certainly, Joe will be here and the team, and thanks for joining us this quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jason Kiser. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Kiser","Great, thank you. And thanks everybody for joining us. Joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman; Tom Cullen, EVP of Corporate Development; Erik Carlson, our CEO; Brian Neylon, the President of DISH; Warren Schlichting, the President of Sling; Paul Orban, our Chief Accounting Officer; and Tim Messner, our General Counsel.","Before we get into Erik's prepared remarks, we do need to do some safe harbor disclosure, so for that I'll turn it over to Tim.","Timothy Messner","Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone. Statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results and\/or from our forecasts. For more information please refer to the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings. All cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as being applicable to any forward-looking statements we make wherever they appear.","You should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in our SEC filings and should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which we assume no responsibility for updating. As part of the process for the upcoming FCC Auction 102, we filed an application to potentially participate as a bidder for those spectrum assets. Because of the FCC's rules, we are not able to discuss what if any spectrum resources we may intend to bid on and we will not be answering any questions about the auction on today's call.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to our CEO, Erik Carlson.","Erik Carlson","Well, thank you, Tim and good morning everyone. Both Paul and I have a few remarks before we open it up to Q&A. On the wireless front we're 388 days away from our March 7, 2020 build out deadline and the deployment team is in full swing. Crews are working at knitting, staging and installing gear on towers across the nation. A lot of work is ahead. But progress is definitely mounting. And Charlie and Tom are both here for questions on wireless.","Over the past year, I've been fairly consistent on the theme of excellent customer experience as a strategy for DISH. Delivering the best in service, technology and value has been a consistent goal. This is intentional in a category as challenged as this one. This is a rational way for us to stand apart. Our internal metrics confirm our path.","For the year we reported 1.78% churn at DISH TV. That's the full picture including Latino. If you were to look at just general market, we continue to deliver historic company lows for churn. Part and parcel of the customer experiences having the right customer and you may have noticed we're a bit higher and stack year-over-year.","A couple of factors to consider, as many of you know, we've been pursuing a strategy for finding the right customer in the right geography and delivering that household the right service, technology and value that will deliver us the profitable long-term relationship for DISH.","The emphasis has led to a higher commission for an independent retail channel and an increase in hardware costs as a higher percentage of our new customers are activating with higher price receivers like the Hopper 3 instead of some of our remanufactured gear.","Now, another dimension is the SAC picture. In 2017, we had more low SAC, Puerto Rico subscribers, those that were impacted by Hurricane Maria reactivate as compared to 2018, which effectively lowered our DISH TV SAC during 2017.","Let me touch on programming for just a moment, first on Univision. It's fair to conclude that we've been unable to achieve a reasonable deal for our customers. And at this point, customers who are heavy Univision viewers have likely found alternatives including our customers who installed off-air antennas and who are able to leave Univision programming at no cost.","For our part, we expect the situation to offer some advantages over the long-term. Especially as you introduce an OTA into the picture, and we're able to charge less for DISH Latino to our customers. With regard to HBO and AT&T there haven't been meaningful moment. HBO is demanding a contract that would have forced DISH customers to subsidize both HBO and Cinemax even if customers chose not to subscribe to those services.","So our view hasn't changed. AT&T stance remains where the fundamental negatives of their merger with Time Warner. Consistent with the guidance I shared with you in the last call. It's fair to say that together HBO and Univision account for a little bit more than half of our net sub loss in the quarter.","Let me close out a few observations on Sling. We're pleased that sub growth continues in the right direction and that we continue to lead the category in live OTT. I think that's a product with several points coming together. We continue to invest in platform stability, we found that customers are incredibly sensitive to performance and the ad experience in Sling continues to improve and by that I mean we're delivering on DAI driven advertising, programmatic, addressable and cross platform.","That's great for us, that's great for the brands and it creates an advertising environment that's better for customers. In fact we've seen ad revenues on Sling grow three fold in the past year and that's on top of the tenfold increase I shared with you on last February's call.","We remain margin positive on every sub we bring into Sling and that's reflective of a disciplined, dare I say rational program that Warren and his team are running. Drafting the right content, the right add ons like DVR and with the right technical expertise on the mobile and fixed platforms that our customers love. We remain bullish on live OTT and the experience that the Sling team is shaping and delivering is really second to none.","So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Paul who has a few brief remarks on the quarter and then we'll open up for Q&A. Paul.","Paul Orban","Thank you, Eric. Good morning everyone. Our core Pay-TV business made positive strides throughout 2018. Our DISH TV team continued to focus on acquiring and retaining high quality subscribers with long-term profitability. Our Sling TV team added content and grew the subscriber base.","Consistent with previous calls, I want to outline the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. This had $154 million positive impact to both operating income and EBITDA for the full year. The benefit from this new standard will decrease over time as the deferred COGS begin to build up.","2018 operating income and EBITDA were both higher year-over-year by 580 million and 368 million respectively. Adjusted for onetime items such as REV break [ph] and the impacts of the 2017 litigation expense and asset impairment, operating income would have been relatively flat down $16 million year-over-year.","EBITDA would have been down $228 million. In 2017, EBITDA benefited from $105 million of other income primarily related to gains on marketable investment securities. Free cash flow continues to be strong at $1.2 billion.","Now for the P&L details, revenues down 5% year-over-year due to fewer DISH TV subscribers and lower Pay-TV ARPU partially offset by the growth of the Sling subscriber base.","Subscriber related expenses decreased 4%, also as a result of fewer DISH TV subscribers. Our programming expenses were positively impacted by the Univision and HBO channel removals. Our variable expenses improved due to fewer subscribers and increased operational efficiencies.","Our satellite and transmission expenses decreased $81million or 12%. Certain satellite leases expired and cost decreased in our digital broadcast operations.","Our subscriber acquisition costs decreased 435 million or 36%, largely due to fewer DISH TV activations and the impact of capitalizing certain commissioned costs under the new revenue accounting standard.","As a reminder, substantially all of our interest expense is being capitalized while we are building out our network. Also, our effective tax rate is lower in 2018 due to the Federal Tax Reform Act.","Additionally related to our wireless network, it's important to know that because we are currently building that network, much of our spend related to the build out is being capitalized, which you do not see in the P&L","Pay-TV ARPU is down due to a higher percentage of Sling TV subscribers in the Pay-TV subscriber base. In addition, we had a decrease in revenue related to premium channels put into impact of the HBO channel removal and pay Pay-Per-View Boxing Events. This decrease was partially offset by DISH TV programming price increases and increases in revenue per subscriber related to Sling TV.","The Sling increases was mainly driven by the mix of customers taking higher price packages and add on revenue such as extras, cloud DVR and ad sales. In addition, the impact of the $5 increase on our orange package began in the third quarter and was fully realized starting in the fourth quarter.","With that, I'll turn it over for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Philip Cusick with JP Morgan. Mr. Cusick, your line is open.","Jason Kiser","Perhaps we should go to the next caller.","Operator","Okay, next we'll move to Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you, just a couple for me, first on the refinancing risk. Charlie, I guess there's a little bit of a language change in the 10-K in terms of refinancing and there is a risk that's been added there. So just wanted to understand how are you thinking about the balance sheet and all the maturity that are coming up? Is there any difference in the way you're thinking about the balance sheet today versus maybe beginning of last year in terms of maybe raising secured debt or something on those lines, especially as you go into the 10 billion phase of the build out - the phase 2 of the build out? And secondly, more from a core performance trend line perspective, as we go into the first couple of quarters this year, should we see any change in trends given that the biggest impact of sub loss is due to loss of carriage tends to happen close to when the loss of content actually happens and should expect that to moderate in the coming quarters? Thanks.","Jason Kiser","Kannan, this is Jason. I'll take the first one on the refinancing risk. I mean, we continually monitor all of our capital markets options just like we always have. There's nothing really new there. The market got tied up a little bit in the fourth quarter and we keep our eye on that type of stuff all the time. We're constantly evaluating what's available to us. I think we've got many alternatives that are available to us both for RevPar [ph] or for fresh capital. We've looked at things that are at the operating company, we've looked at things that are the holding company, so I think right now we're pretty comfortable that there's not any urgent need to do anything. Everybody's familiar with our maturity profile and as we move on and get into some of the bigger maturities we'll continue to look at that and determine what's the best avenue to take, but we haven't made a determination on anything at this point. Eric you want to take I think the programming question.","Erik Carlson","Yeah, Kannan on the carriage obviously, I think that you normally you see a trend very close to the takedown of contents. In this particular case there's a couple inflection points. On the Univision side obviously, we had a removal midsummer, I think the end of January - June, sorry about that and then Deportes followed that in November, early November along with HBO. So there's no doubt on the Univision front we are seeing declining customer attrition. However, I wouldn't give guidance that we're through all of the customers leaving us. On the HBO front, obviously, HBO had an impact along with Univision in the fourth quarter and I think HBO has the Game of Thrones coming up in April and obviously that could impact us if we're not able to reach an agreement, yeah.","Charles Ergen","And this is Charlie. I think what happens is, it's always disappointing when you lose a long-term partner and both Univision and HBO, particularly HBO were long-term partners, but there's different dynamics there. HBO obviously was acquired by AT&T and AT&T has taken a very anti-competitive approach to carriage because they view DISH potentially as one of their larger competitors and so that's strictly a - they made a decision not to engage in any kind of conversation any company would realistically take. The downside for them is that customers love DISH and are at least within the Pay-TV business I think we're the highest - most polls and most survey show us as most highly rated. So they like their DISH service, they like their Hopper experience and so some customers do leave us because HBO is a very strong brand and has strong content. But some customers find that they can live without it. And then some customers still stay with DISH and love it and they find another way to get HBO. And that means they go - they'll go to their friend's house for 10 weeks during Game of Thrones or there becomes an increased usage of - every young person knows how to go on the internet and get a code and watch HBO for free. And so you end up with a piracy issue that unfortunately, we prefer not to see. But when customers get some taken away, they resort to the other mean. So and then we work with other partners that have movies which are very popular with our customers and we see increased usage of that. It does affect our ARPU obviously, when we sell HBO for $15 and Cinemax $10, you lose those subs. You lose ARPU there, so that's one of the intension. So the Univision, they really had - it's kind of a perfect storm at a change management who would - I think the existing management would say in private that unrealistic expectations of what they're trying to do DISH on a renewal deal.","So the management and DISH probably have a pretty good - actually a pretty good relationship absent the inability to get to a deal and the reason that we haven't been able to get to a deal is that our best customers who love Univision and we have a lot of customers who love Univision they left or they put an off-air antenna to get the programming. So they've made adjustments to view Univision or leave us to go get it, the remaining customers on Univision still like Univision, but not at the level that the customers have left. So that makes it really hard to put Humpty Dumpty back together again, even though the relationship I think is - I think that - but not for lack of trying on both the Univision managements part and the DISH managements part, so HBO is not trying, Univision is tying, but they're difficult situations. What our direction to management is - that's not an excuse to go to continue to lose subs, right. With the Univision we have an advantage in the marketplace now that Latino subs can get - can save $10, $12, $15 from DISH and we'll provide a local antenna, so they can get the program and save $10, $12, $15 over everybody else in the industry. And we have to take advantage of that in some markets because we're the only provider, major provider that's in that situation today. So it's going to be y cost advantage and we can go out and start building our Latino base based on that cost advantage. So that becomes a tail on it and then we move forward.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Thank you","Operator","And next we'll move to Philip Cusick with JP Morgan.","Philip Cusick","Thanks guys. Sorry about that. I need you to get that 5G network up in the air. Charlie, can you talk about timing on the IoT build and the cash needs as we go through the year for that? And then second, what's the latest on timing of your 5G equipment? Assuming you had the money when could you officially start building that network?","Charles Ergen","Okay and Tom may want to jump in on this, but nothing's really changed on the cost or the timing. The cost of our network is between five - initial phase 1 build of Narrowband IoT network, it's somewhere between $500 million and $1billion through 2020. We continue to make progress in building that network. We intend \u2013our expectation is we're going to meet the deadlines, we know there's going to be a lot of obstacles in the way, but we intend to meet that deadline. CapEx will accelerate in 2019 from where it has been in the past and what's the other part of the question?","Erik Carlson","5G equipment.","Charles Ergen","5G equipment the - because we're a - our plan is to build a standalone ground for 5G network. In other words, the only other country that's doing that today is China. So if we really want to compete with China in 5G, in my opinion, you need a standalone 5G network from scratch and India - and then second, more importantly, maybe you need the architecture that goes with it. So if you want to compete with China. It's imperative that in the United States somebody builds that standalone network that specification for 3GPP standalone specification is not out at the earliest until the end of this year. And then it takes several months to get equipment from that. So I would imagine that sometime in a little bit over a year from now we'll start to have equipment in standalone 5G that we can start deploying that equipment. And so today we're basically architecting that network and putting the business plan together. So that will do to the rest of this year and then we will have a business plan for a network like you may only see in China. And how have we believed and we believe that with the record ingenuity and other people help we can build a network that can arrive or that will be better than that.","Philip Cusick","Has there been any change in the discussions with potential partners to help fund that positive or negative?","Charles Ergen","We haven't had - I don't know if we had any negative discussions. We certainly like everybody else - I'd say it this way, people are very interest - those people are very knowledgeable, so perhaps more knowledgeable than an analyst can be because you're in the business or they build product for it or they've studied the architecture for a long time. I think they're pretty positive and I think that the real 5G and the architecture that goes with it when you put those two things together, I think most people virtually any business or any business in the United States realize that can be powerful compared to what they get today in a wireless network. And so we've had discussions from - we've had interest and discussions for from unexpected places, but our strategy really is where somebody has the infrastructure in place or they do things - they do a good job at it, we're going to try to partner with them. We may just be - they just may be a vendor for us, we need to pay them, right. It could be other things that happen there. But rather than try to reinvent it ourselves, say an example, we're not probably going to build towers, we're probably not going to lay a bunch of fiber if somebody already got fiber. So when we need edge compute, if somebody is in the edge compute business that's probably not a business we have to enter. If somebody doesn't do it or doesn't have confidence in us, then by all means, we will do it. Very similar to - we launched our satellites in the DBS business, some vendors refused to launch for us because they didn't think we could pay him. Some people refused to build satellites for us because they didn't think we could pay him or we've been successful. But some people did believe we had a chance to be successful and those people have become long-term vendors and partners for us for a long time. I think the same things going to happen here. Some people will be skeptical as many people in life are and some people will look at our track record and our commitment and our business plan and there'll be opportunistic.","Philip Cusick","Are you any more willing to borrow money against the spectrum through raise that 5G money than you were before?","Charles Ergen","Well, we know it's going to cost us in the magnitude of $10 billion and we're going to raise capital. I think that capital will come in - I think that capital will come from various different capital structures and sources, but I don't think we're dependent upon with.","Philip Cusick","Thanks, Charlie.","Operator","And next we'll to Michael McCormack with Guggenheim Partners.","Michael McCormack","Hey guys, thanks. Charlie, maybe just a quick comment on what you're hearing from Washington with respect to your Narrowband IoT build? When will we get comfort that that's going to meet their desires or needs? And then with respect to Sling, just maybe a comment on the competitive landscape there, whether or not you are share takers from DirecTV now losses and the impact of Hulu Live and YouTube TV? Thanks.","Charles Ergen","Warren why don't you take that first part?","Warren Schlichting","Okay sure, I mean I think it's probably fairly well known that DirecTV was heavily promoting that product and so we just follow our; A, we listen to the customer and B, we follow our sort of guidance internally and fiscal responsibility. So if we look at it, it's taking share as much as we do. We just keep marching in the direction that works for us. And as Eric mentioned, margin positive and we continue to accumulate customers. And frankly, I'm not exactly sure where they come from. But it's a good story for us.","Charles Ergen","Yeah, on Washington, we don't - we haven't heard - obviously, we got - we met with staff and the commissioners, we got questions, follow up questions on that. We've answered those. Those follow up questions. We haven't, to my knowledge have not heard anything since that period of time. And obviously, we're past the point of no return at this point to do something different. I don't think there should be any skepticism about Narrowband IoT or Narrowband IoT build out meaning our commitment for the FCC, because I think the rules are pretty clear in terms of flexible use. And it's pretty clear that the incumbents all have net have followed our lead with Narrowband IoT in the United States and of course other people are doing that around the world. I don't think we're happy that our network is not going to be as robust as perhaps some existing networks because we're limited by five megahertz of nationwide uplink spectrum, so we only have that clear the rest of the spectrum is either tied up in the - in an interference studies by the government and from the auctions and also tied up in DE stuff that's gone to FCC, where all the information is in, but the FCC hasn't ruled yet and so that is more difficult to plan for something that we don't control at this point.","Jason Kiser","In addition to the 600.","Charles Ergen","In addition to the 600, which isn't going to be cleared until June and there's always the risk that the broadcaster's will ask for more time there. So we obviously, if we had ability to use the spectrum that we own and also work at DE partners in a more robust way we could build a more robust network. So that's why - so we're all disappointed that we that we can't do a little bit more and I'm sure that given the kind of race to 5G and the - I think within the Congress and the FCC and additionally also the incumbent operators, we want this country to lead in 5G and I think we're going to play a big part in that.","Michael McCormack","Great thanks guys.","Operator","And next we'll move Jonathan Chapman with New Street Research.","Jonathan Chapman","Thanks a quick one for Mr. Ergen. So a lot of the comments you've made about the 5G network that you're planning in phase 2 has echoes, at least for me of what we saw Jio do with 4g in India. And I'm wondering to what extent you've looked at that example and some of the experience the disruption that Jio bought to India you think could be replicated here. And then just following on from Phil's question, in looking for a partner, are your discussions primarily with strategic and financial players in the US or could international players come into this as a partner as well? Thanks.","Thomas Cullen","Hey, Jonathan, this is Tom. Yes, we of course, have looked at Jio and they've graciously spent some time with us to help us better understand how they approach the market. It's pretty well documented how disruptive they were in terms of elimination of many carriers and forcing prices and competition to respond. There's obviously differences between 4G and 5G and as mentioned earlier on the call, I think everyone in the industry understands that 3GPP has yet to finalize the release 16 documentation or codification of the standard, which really in release 16 are the three pillar elements of 5G, which is enhanced mobile broadband, ultra low latency and massive connectivity. So once that gets finalized late this year or early next then the ecosystem begins to develop. What we're also excited about is what's happening around virtualization and the opening of interfaces within radio access networks, which we think will have a significant impact on capital and operating expense in a network in the 2021 time frame. And of course having a green field with a clean sheet of paper gives us an advantage because you won't be burdened by any legacy previous generation equipment and architecture.","Charles Ergen","Yeah and this is Charlie. I just would add that realize of what Jio did was clean sheet of paper and 4G, very little band - I think they had ran 40 megahertz of bandwidth to work and they have, I think, by last count they're somewhere in the 270, 280 million customers on that network after 18 months. But the most important thing I think that we learned was how important architecture is to the network and the efficiencies that you get in both the CapEx and OpEx situation and flexibility that you get in your network when you architect it and spend your time on architecture and then obviously, part of that architecture is virtualization that Tom alluded. I'd say this way, I believe that 5G with the proper architecture, right and a clean sheet of paper has the ability to be far more reaching then the marketplace understands today. I think T-Mobile understands that which is why they don't want us to be in the business. But I think the external when you're talking about 5G being 28 gigahertz to a couple people in Sacramento, our 5GE being - but I actually don't know what that is. 5GE is something Sprint thinks that the illegal and AT&T thinks that's something the American public is going to latch on to it. I don't know what that is, but what we're doing is different than that. That's all I'd say and I think that as we get farther into this that would become more evident. And it's starting to become avid and obviously the people that have spent time with us and really, really spend time in this industry.","Jonathan Chapman","And Charlie with the one's you're doing on - sorry, go ahead.","Charles Ergen","No, I'm sorry. Go ahead.","Jonathan Chapman","I was going to say just with the work you're doing with vendors on virtualization could that result in a network that costs less than $10 billion to build or is that $10 billion still stand?","Charles Ergen","We've seen estimates for less than that. And we've seen estimates for more than that. So I think one of the - I think in taking on big projects, I think it's imperative that the strategic manager of a company, which is our board and executive staff, that we set out those challenges. They need to be realistic, but they need to be realistic and achievable, but they need to be a stretch to. And so I think that 10 billion gives you a feel for what we really think we're going to do. I hope, you know, we said $500 million to $1 billion on our initial phase. I hope we come I hope I don't know where we're going to end up. I hope we come in look closer to 500 million and a billion but I don't know and 10 billion I think we're going to be in that range, could be a little higher, it could be lower.","Operator","And are you ready to move to your next question?","Charles Ergen","Yes.","Operator","Jason Bazinet with Citi.","Jason Bazinet","Yeah, I guess a couple years ago we were pretty confident you weren't going to get an adverse ruling from the FCC on the DE discount issue. And we're wrong. And I just wonder if you could spend a second and talk about what happens mechanically if the FCC does sort of rule that your network doesn't meet the build out requirements? Not so much what I'm just saying, let's posit that that's true, what are sort of the next steps that happen?","Charles Ergen","Well, I guess in my previous said, that that's not going to happen, but obviously to extent you like anything else, if you thought in life if you think you're right you then - you go to the regulatory process which could include up litigation, so both on the DE side when they ruled against the DE structure, by the way properly the court agreed with them resulted in litigation, but the court also said that the FCC aired and not giving as they head out every other DE and continue to give DEs the right to restructure to meet the DE and I'm proud of what the DEs did and what DISH did in restructuring and taking those 36 things that the FCC had concerns about and restructuring all those 36 things. So now that the - if the FCC serious about getting spectrum put to use, right, we would expect that the FCC would at least rule on the current application in front of them, right. At least rule on it so we can get moved the process down the road. Now, obviously we'd like to have them rule in our in our favor and the DEs favor, but the extent that there's still issues we certainly like to know it sooner rather than later.","Jason Bazinet","And so as this wines it's let's assume that they rule against you in at once its way through court do can you would continue to just sort of build out your network as if you're ultimately going to win in court that's sort of the plan if we go around?","Charles Ergen","Yeah, we're going to build - yeah, we're going to continue IoT network and the 5G network and again we don't believe that's going to come to cook. I think that's been \u2013again, one analyst said there's no way we were building towers, one analyst said there's no way Narrowband IoT or even T-Mobile who's been a big adversary in terms to get in this market. Now, I think actually, now admits in the filing that Narrowband IoT does meet an obligation, so I don't put words in what they said, but that was the gist of it. So I don't think it - I just think that's a bit overblown and I don't think that - look, we have to execute. I mean, I don't think - I think we're coming under a different level of scrutiny than probably any other wireless provider has. But having said that I don't believe that the FCC is looking to change the rule on flexible use; A, I don't think they can do it legally, but I don't think they're looking to do that. And I think that as they understand more, and this is up to us, right, some of this is our fault. But as they understand more about what we're doing, and as they start understanding what the rest of the world's doing and what we're doing and they understand the need to lead in 5G and what a standalone network does that the other guys can't do maybe I'm Pollyanna, but I think that that the FCC for the most part will be supportive of that and I think they'll be very supportive of that.","Jason Bazinet","Very helpful, thank you.","Charles Ergen","Because they are \u2013this is a great FCC for being supportive of trying to get wireless assets used better and to advance the technology and lead the world in 5G. They are to a person on the FCC and staff they are very focused on that and I think they've done just a simple example and kind of controversial, but they did pass regulations for - or improved regulations or lack of regulation for small cell that wasn't easy politically and that wasn't - it's maybe not a popular decision, but that's important if we're going to lead in 5G and they did - this FCC did that and so they do a lot of good things.","Jason Bazinet","Thank you","Operator","And next we'll move to Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Vijay, your line is open.","Charles Ergen","You can move on. ","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll hear from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.","Walter Piecyk","Thanks. Charlie, two questions, first on CapEx, I think you were - you've already started putting some radios on towers in 2018, there was - CapEx is imperceptible I guess, it just seemed like a normal run rate. If you think about 2019 when would the bulk of CapEx hit? And then the second question is, the Sprint T-Mobile deal looks like it's coming to its final stages here. If the government blocks it and you have an opportunity to partner with one of those companies, which would be preferable? Now, I would think that Mass and Sprint might be a little bit more desperate for a solution for Sprint from the other side T-Mobile has probably a greater need for mid band spectrum, they get better scale, they can generate free cash flow and help to fund the build, so which of those two partners would you find more attractive if they were both an option to you for the 5G build? Thanks.","Thomas Cullen","Hey Wall, it's Tom. I'll take the first one. Yeah, as you know in order to hang radios on towers, there's many steps that you have to go through in terms of milestones before you can proceed to construction. So much of that is moving through the pipeline in late fourth quarter and early first quarter, but also had some pretty significant weather issues in some parts of the country. So to answer your question, I would expect second and third quarter to ramp activity pretty significantly in terms of tower activity and therefore the associated CapEx.","Charles Ergen","And then - I mean it's no - I mean this is public, we tried to buy Sprint, right and obviously we're continuing discussions with them prior to their merger with T-Mobile. So we'll have to wait and see what the regulators decide. I think Sprint and T-Mobile have done a pretty good job on the political side of their merger and I think we're sympathetic to some of the things that they're saying, but they've done a really poor job on the antitrust side through Economic Study. Their own Economic Studies they've showed the prices would go up and obviously they would become the biggest hoarder spectrum by going over the market - by the limits that the FCC is - the screen limit, so but 300 - really almost two and a half times more spectrum than other people. So that I think they've got challenges there, but let's see where that ends up and then regardless of where that ends up from DISH perspective, we want a chance to compete.","Richard Greenfield","And Charlie, if I could just follow up -","Charles Ergen","And I fail, but I want a chance to compete.","Richard Greenfield","It's Rich Greenfield.","Charles Ergen","Sorry, go ahead, Wall.","Richard Greenfield","No, it's Rich Greenfield, you had said on the - in the release that - or in your comments before that roughly a little bit more than half of your 381,000 subscriber losses were due to your programming issues. So I'm just going around and say roughly 200,000, but I think you were been pretty clear and not just on this call, but prior calls that most of the Univision pain was felt in those first couple of months after the drop in late June, early July. Does that mean that HBO or the loss of HBO contributed the majority of that 200,000 subscriber loss because it sort of surprises me with HBO still available on Amazon Prime and HBO NOW which you can buy on broadband like it just seems surprising to me that HBO would have that much of an impact when there's lots of ways to get HBO, so maybe you could just clear that up for us?","Charles Ergen","yeah I don't quit up, but I think as Eric said in his comments, with Univision there wasn't - there was - Univision per se went down in June, but Univision Deportes which is their Sports Network and all the soccer went down in the end of October. So there was - what I would - I don't have numbers in front, but my guess is that obviously Univision that had pretty dramatic drop through the summer and then maybe started leveling off and then when the soccer fans last soccer there was probably another drop there. And HBO, I think that - the HBO will be interesting because as you say people find another way to get it, in HBO at least HBO hasn't had any real new shows come \u2013their promises - put it this way, their main claim to fame today from a show is Game of Thrones and that hasn't been on during the period that our new shows haven't been on during the period that they've been down. So I think that realistically you would expect that when Game of Thrones comes on you may see a pickup in defections from HBO. But the bosses are - the losses for both take downs, we have certainly had losses and we would have preferred not to add take downs. It's always painful for our customers, when it's painful, our customers painful for us. Warren, do you want to add something there?","Warren Schlichting","I think you covered it, I mean, Charlie and Rich I mean, roughly half of your math works there.","Richard Greenfield","Thanks very much.","Warren Schlichting","I think the thing for analysts on the call is the underlying businesses is actually - I think the steps that Eric and team have taken the last couple of years, the painful steps of right sizing our customers, eliminating customers that aren't profitable, which we had some, of not doing crazy giveaways and just trying to have numbers for the street, but rather run it as a business and run it for the long-term profitability of that business. I think the core business that's paying big dividends. I think AT&T to their credit is probably going through that similar process now and so they'll have a few quarters where they have to right size of that because they were very aggressive on some of their promotions that just couldn't possibly be making money and at some point you have - at some point there's race to the bottom and tell people realize there at the bottom and then people start climbing the way back up. And I think we're kind of there, we're already past that, for the most part I think others in the industry will get there and you'll see some stabilization and result once it happens.","Richard Greenfield","Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll move to Marci Ryvicker with Wolfe Research.","Marci Ryvicker","I have a couple questions the first, the ecosystem is clearly changing and it feels like it's just going to get harder for the core business to continue to run, so I guess why doesn't it make sense at this point to do a JV with at AT&T and share costs?","Warren Schlichting","Well, it's pretty simple if they're sticking a gun to your head and take an HBO where you're probably not have long conversations. I mean, I'd last I looked at HBO is owned by AT&T, you can't - we're not real good at guns at our head?","Marci Ryvicker","And then I want to ask a question on the core business, so without HBO and Univision and is it safe to assume that programming expense in 2019 should be lower than 2018?","Warren Schlichting","It will be lower. Well, there's price increases, they get bounces to out - they will be definitely lower than they otherwise would have been. Those are certainly two of the products that subjectively based on viewer measurement, might be considered overpriced.","Erik Carlson","And on a per subscriber basis you'll see increases in programming costs even in spite of HBO and Univision being down, just because [indiscernible] and other ones have such high increases in them.","Marci Ryvicker","And then third thing there's been some conversation Charlie that either you or DISH or both are backing locast.org [ph], can you give any comments on that?","Charles Ergen","No.","Marci Ryvicker","Thank you.","Warren Schlichting","Operator, we'll play one more from the analyst community and then move to media.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our final question from the analyst community. [Operator Instructions] Our final analyst question comes from Gregory Williams with Cowen and company","Gregory Williams","Great thanks for squeezing me in. My question is on G&A was up fourth quarter. I get the seasonal aspects to it, but it's up fourth quarter 7 million over a fourth quarter last year. Just wondering that anything specific to call out? And then changing gears just want to talk a little bit about spectrum, in the last quarter or since last earnings the C-band and CBRS spectrum band developments have been occurring and for one C-band it looks like there we can see as much as 300 megahertz to market higher than the 200 that was proposed and just want to know or just be interested in your take on these developments and spectrum in general as it relates to your portfolio? Thanks.","Paul Orban","Yeah, this is Paul. I'll take the G&A question. There's small puts and takes there, there's nothing really to call out on that increase.","Warren Schlichting","And I think as it relates to spectrum, I think that trying to get more spectrum available here for satellite are for [indiscernible] some competition is worthwhile endeavors and I think CBRS is - C-Band is a little bit tougher, CBRS we're moving along and the royalties like kind of out and looks like that's going to proceed. C-Band - the C-Band does a little tougher because base cap for non-U.S. companies, European and Canadian companies that they control that spectrum and you kind of - normally you have an auction process where the government but sharing any proceeds that similar to what maybe the incentive auction, so I think that that's the normal kind of process there at least in the modern era but that's a bit more difficult in this situation. So, on other hand, I think politically windfalls to foreign companies that might not be paying U.S. taxes on it, then might be, you know, have tax treaties and might be interesting effect on CBRS from the interference perspective, or things that people have to look at. But in general, we'd be supportive of CBRS and C-Band additions to the marketplace as long as that's done in a manner that's fair and equitable to both incumbents and new entrants, and to the U.S. Treasury.","Gregory Williams","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take questions from the members of the media. [Operator Instructions] Our first media question comes from Sheila Dang with Reuters.","Sheila Dang","Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on whether you have any more programming contacts that are up for renewal this year. Do you expect to have conversations with anyone else coming up?","Charles Ergen","It's Charlie, we have - I'd say a couple of things, one is, we always have programming contracts coming up, so that every year there will be no different. I will say that - one of the things that in the AT&T merger with Time Warner that was a positive was that they agreed to baseball-style binding arbitration or they offered everyone baseball-stuff type arbitration. So that's a process where if somebody chose to get into that process or go through that process, those signals were not good, would not be subject going down at those contracts are up.","Sheila Dang","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll next move to Scott Moritz with Bloomberg.","Scott Moritz","Great. Thanks. Charlie, you're pretty accurate with your prediction about HBO impacting the subscriber levels. And as you look ahead, you're already predicting that, probably, Game of Thrones contributes more subscriber losses. Just curious if and to follow Sheila's question, are there more contracts that might be significant coming up that you can point to and is there a sense that scent of blood in the water that maybe you might not have the leverage and negotiations with future contracts?","Charles Ergen","No, we've never had - we've never had leverage, I don't think that has changed. We're a little pipsqueak in a world of really big companies. So we've never had any leverage. But we do write big checks to programmers and we have real data. I mean, we approach it differently, right? We look at real data about what our customer views and how they - real data what they view and what the cost per viewing our, there is a bunch of - along with a bunch of other data. So we have a relative basis for what people watch and what they're willing to pay. And you also look at what the alternatives to get that product, right. So HBO, obviously, today is available from AT&T Direct. They can get it a variety of different ways. So, and then we - we have a feel for what it is. Most programmers at least historically have said we have a budget to make, we got this - we got this much last year. We want an increase. We want a 5%, 10%, 15% depending on what this local TV it might be more than that an increase and we have to meet their rationale, they're going to make their budgets, they have to increase. But even the CEO of AT&T said, in a world of declining ratings, 6%, 7%, 8% percent increases are not sustainable. I think we figured that out a few years ago that that's not sustainable. So, look, we'd love the partners that we've had, they've helped us grow our business. I think we've done a good job of helping them grow their businesses where somebody wants to work with us. We'll do our dankest to get subscribers and make sure our products good and our signals good and if somebody doesn't want to work with us, we'll move on and we're going to figure out how to run this company profitable and there's ways to do that. But again, I think HBO's unique situation because of the AT&T acquisition of the Time Warner. And Univision was a little bit unique because there was a management change both at the executive level, and also on the other programming department. So there was nobody there that had the history other than the budgetary item in front of them that the previous team had. So they - you know, we got off to a slow start. Let's put that way. Little bit of miscommunication.","Scott Moritz","Thanks.","Charles Ergen","By the way, I think you look at history, we've probably done 10,000 - I'll say 1000 deals we probably had, you know, a very small percentage as ever lead to a takedown and I think in terms of permanent - just a handful of been permanent losses. But if something's unrealistic and if you can make more money and service your customer better by taking some down by all means, I think you should do it. There's no certainty in this business.","Operator","Our next move today today's with [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks so much. There's so much investment on the content side and direct to consumer offerings, both of the companies, you're in disputes with those. And in HBO's case, they've taken pains to describe HBO now as a compliment; it's neutral in terms of their core business. They're trying to do it collaboratively. But as you step back and kind of look at its evolution over these last couple of years, as well as other partners and other programmers. I mean, isn't it an irritant? How would you view the direct to consumer business, I mean, hasn't made life more complicated I'd just be interested in any thoughts there?","Charles Ergen","Well, first of all I take issue that HBO is collaborative, I think they clearly are going to competition with the distributors out there. And they do two things, at AT&T sells them for free, right, in a bundle. So it's actually free for life, right? It has been in the past and of course they sell direct. So that's not very collaborative for people that have helped build their business over the years. But having said that, that's where the world's going, as management, you have to make decisions based on where things are going. So, yes, the direct to consumer businesses is and that's why we started Sling. It's why we moved into connectivity, transition to connectivity, because we saw those kinds of things happen years, maybe years before, most people saw those things. The other piece of it is that that Eric and team, the businesses is not going away, there are - we have real strength. There are people in rural America that going to customer direct is not possible today. They don't have fast enough broadband connection to do that. There are people that love the fact that the viewing experience on a Dish network system with the hopper with primetime anything and ability to skip through commercials with the ability to record 1000 hours of programming to never miss your show, the ability to get a second subscription for free with Sling and to watch your TV on any device and anywhere you are the fact that we have a voice remote where you don't - where you now you can discover programming different ways. That's a pretty popular product with a lot of people. And I'm pretty omniscient about what's out there and I still love my Hopper and I changed, right, because that viewing experience is far superior to whatever. And I can get broadband and I do have high speed broadband. So second thing is there's places where our competition can't go. If you want to - if you're a truck or an RV or tailgater at a game, right? You can't go there with - have you ever tried it a game to get a connection for stream video just doesn't happen. So we have unique areas of our business that that our team can focus on and grow those sides of business, so absent HBO and Univision, I think you'd see this company in a little bit different. We're not - I'd say maybe we're not as pessimistic as the tone of the analysts on this call to our core business. And Eric, you want to add anything to that? Because we talk about it literally every day.","Warren Schlichting","Operator we're at the top of the hour, so we'll take one more call from the media community.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll move to Andrew Dotson with Denver Business Journal [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks, Charlie. You guys did some testing on the ATSC 3.0 standard that broadcasters are working to launch I think it was last spring. I'm just curious, what have you excited about that standard? And how could DISH leverage it as were you mentioned earlier, you're putting up antennas to help people get Univision during the blackout. Does this good? Is it something different that have you more excited about it?","Charles Ergen","Well, the way I would say it is ATSC 3.0 is new broadcasting standard and when I - I don't know if you were on earlier. We talked about we don't want to build infrastructure where we don't have to and the broadcasting community particularly the independent broadcasters, they have a whole set of - what are they going to do long-term, you know, in terms of growing their business what's the shift they need to. So ATSC 3.0 is a new opportunity from our broadcast perspective where we think there might be good partnerships between broadcasters and us in the sense that they can use that technology to broadcast and different revenue stream from them that we probably wouldn't participate in, but we also can be the gap filler for them since we're going to be having towers in more rural communities along highways for autonomous - for vehicles and things like that. In addition, we have uplink spectrum that they don't have from a broadcast side when you put those things together. That looks to me like a potentially interesting match of technology. So we're testing - we continue to test, we're going to do even more test and we continue to work with broadcasters to see where they want to go with that. And look, at this point, we're in the early and in the first inning of ATSC 3.0. I don't think anybody knows exactly where that can go. But I would just say that we normally see technologies, we're not always right, but we have a pretty good track record of identifying technologies and staying focused on them for a long period of time until they come to fruition. And ATSC 3.0 has that potential, but we don't know where it leads we'll continue to monitor and test it.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Jason Kiser","Operator, that's it for us today.

My name is Laurel and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DISH Network Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Year End 2015 Earnings Conference Call.","I'll now turn the call over to Jason Kiser. Please go ahead.","Jason Kiser - Treasurer","Thanks, Laurel. Thanks for joining us, everybody. I'm Jason Kiser, Treasurer here at DISH Network. Joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman and CEO; Tom Cullen, EVP of Corporate Development; Roger Lynch, CEO of Sling TV; Erik Carlson, new President of DISH Network; we've got Bernie Han, Executive Vice President; and Steve Swain, our CFO; Paul Orban, our Controller; and Stanton Dodge, our General Counsel.","Before we open it up for Q&A, we do need to do our Safe Harbor disclosures. So I'll turn that over to Stanton, and I think Steve's got a couple of things that he wants to cover as well before we open up for Q&A.","R. Stanton Dodge - Secretary, Executive VP & General Counsel","Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in your reports, and we also do not allow audio taping and ask that you respect that. All statements we make during this call are not statements of historically fact and constitute forward-looking statements, which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from historical results and from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a list of those factors, please refer to the front of our 10-K.","All cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as being applicable to any forward-looking statements that we make wherever they appear. You should carefully consider the risks described in our reports, and should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which we assume no responsibility for updating.","Also as part of the process for the Broadcast Incentive Auction, we filed an application to potentially participate as a bidder for those spectrum assets. Because of the FCC's anti-collusion rules, we are not able to discuss what, if any spectrum resources we may intend to bid on.","Operator, with that, I will now turn it over to Steve Swain.","Steven E. Swain - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","All right. Thanks, Stanton. Before going into Q&A, I would like to make a few brief comments about 2015. So looking at the income statement, our 2015 operating income was $1.3 billion, a decrease of $492 million year-over-year primarily due to a couple of one-time items.","First item, we recorded an FCC auction expense of $516 million. This expense was discussed on last quarter's call. The second item is an impairment of $123 million. It was determined that the carrying value of our D1 satellite and its associated ground equipment was greater than the fair value. These assets were originally acquired in our DBSD transaction.","Moving to other income and expense. In 2015, although cash paid for interest increased $21 million to $854 million, interest expense on the P&L decreased $117 million compared to 2014, primarily related to the increase in capitalized interest. The increase in capitalized interest was primarily driven by the AWS-3 licenses which were granted in the fourth quarter and have a carrying value of approximately $10 billion. This stepped up interest capitalization will continue. Meaning, because the total spectrum carrying value is approximately $15 billion, effectively, all of our interest expense will be capitalized off of the income statement in 2016.","For presentation purposes, also note that capitalized interest associated with spectrum was separated from PP&E creating a new line on the cash flow statement. So to maintain prior period comparability when calculating free cash flow, we take operating cash flow and subtract out both PP&E and this new line which is named capitalized interest related to FCC authorizations.","Looking at other income, in 2015 other income increased $347 million to $278 million. 2015 was positively impacted primarily by net realized and unrealized gains on investments. In contrast, 2014 was negatively impacted primarily by unrealized losses on investments.","Next is free cash flow, which for the full year 2015 was approximately $1.3 billion. The year-over-year increase in cash flow was $129 million, primarily driven by lower CapEx, excluding the impact of capitalized interest, lower cash taxes and by a source of cash from working capital, partially offset by the FCC auction expense and decreased cash interest income.","Working capital as a source of cash in 2015 came from both assets and liabilities. On the asset side of the balance sheet, underlying operational changes drove much of the decreases in accounts receivable and inventory balances. On the liability side, the changes in balances were within historical fluctuations and may reverse or partially reverse in 2016.","Lastly, taxes. As shown in note four of our 10-K, in 2015 we paid $16 million in cash for income taxes. Cash paid for taxes was reduced by, among other things, the amortization of our licenses and the AWS-3 licenses. Spectrum amortization for tax purposes is over 15 years, and of course, for GAAP, spectrum is not amortized but instead tested for impairment annually.","One other note on taxes. Although we capitalized a significant portion of interest off the income statement, in 2015 cash paid, whether it is expensed, cash interest paid, whether it is expensed or capitalized is deductible for tax purposes.","Now, we'll open up the call for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Good morning. I know you guys can't talk specifically about your auction plans, but I wonder if you could talk about how you would finance your spending for the auction, if any? And then, as always, we're all interested in hearing what the latest observations are about how you might deploy the spectrum you already have? In particular, I'm thinking about fixed wireless broadband versus mobility. Has your thinking evolved at all given how much talk there has been about fixed wireless broadband over the last couple of months?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","This is Charlie. Craig, you're right. We really can't talk about how \u2013 what we might \u2013 and I think we've taken a broad view of the anti-collusion rules just to be in abundance of caution. So, talking about anything about strategy in terms of even including financing probably is off the table for us for a while.","In terms of spectrum, obviously we've talked in the past about a lot of optionality. The thing that's particularly nice about the mid-band spectrum that is predominantly what we have, it's probably the most versatile of the spectrum that's out there, in the sense that it can be used for small cells with acceptable interference and also can be used in macro cells. So for coverage, so it can actually be used \u2013 it's one of the \u2013 there's not a lot of frequency out there that's kind of in the sweet spot for coverage and capacity.","So when you talk about fixed broadband, to the extent you haven't already seen, you're certainly going to see over the coming years a lot about 28-gig and 38-gig and 60-gig and things like that. Those frequencies obviously will play a significant role long-term in wireless and broadband, but they're uniquely challenged really for, they are not really \u2013 really can't do anything more than very small cells or in some cases, backhaul and line of sight, and that makes a lot of sense potentially in fixed wireless.","So, all I can really say is we're kind of \u2013 what we have is really the most versatile of the, it's more of a Swiss Army knife type spectrum in terms of a wide variety of uses that it could do. And then I think as other things develop, there is a lot of developments going on; 5G obviously, it changes some of the dynamics and certainly in terms of Internet of Things and speeds and so forth.","There's unlicensed spectrum both in 3.5 and 5. There's a 28-gig, 38-gig, 60-gig frequencies. So you have to look at the systems design and, I believe that each piece of spectrum has unique attributes and probably will be used as a result of that for its best economic use. But the frequency that we have, the vast majority of the frequency we have has multiple applications. So it can be used for fixed wireless as well, but I'm not sure that's the best use of it.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. And if I could press for one additional question just with the FCC just having voted on the set top box rules. Could you just offer some commentary on the set top box rules as you see them?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Stanton maybe start with that.","R. Stanton Dodge - Secretary, Executive VP & General Counsel","Sure. And Craig, this is Stanton, Craig. Now, as you know, they just voted to approve the NPRM today, we haven't actually seen the actual words of it. So, of course, we'll have to read that and reflect upon it. But generally speaking, it's our view that the video industry, as everyone is well aware, is currently undergoing a true wave of innovation and experimentation as evidenced by the success of OTT services like our very own Sling TV, and the proliferation of devices on which consumers consume video, such as tablets, mobile phones, Roku, Apple, et cetera. So as we sit here today consumers have unprecedented choices in the terms of video apps and services available to them. So as we sit here today it's really not clear to us that any new regulation is needed to encourage innovation, in fact, it would actually hinder it.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you.","R. Stanton Dodge - Secretary, Executive VP & General Counsel","But we'll have to see in terms of the actual rules \u2013 proposed rules.","Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks, Stan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks. I wonder if we could start with the DBS business? Can you update us, Charlie, on how you think of the strategy for this business? It seems like churn is doing well, but gross adds continue low. Should we expect you to continue to be fairly subdued in competing here? And do you expect to tighten credit more as you go forward, or should we think that gross adds have sort of stabilized at this level? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, I think at least since I've come back as CEO, we've taken a really hard look at the DBS business and said, if we're going to put on customers, we want to put on customers that we think will be long-term profitable. So we're taking a pretty long view of it. And just as kind of a backdrop of that, five or six years ago, we put a customer on DBS, we had a cable company as a competitor and DIRECTV as a competitor. Today, you've got a phone company, you've got the cable company, you've got AT&T DIRECTV, and then you've got a proliferation of OTT companies with more to come. So the likelihood that you're going to keep customers in certain locations as long as you did in the past to me is \u2013 there's more risk that you keep them less time, right?","And at the same time, the industry has gone to $19.99 and a year or two years of free programming, and so SAC has gone up when you count in all the freebies and the gift card and all kinds of stuff you do. So in the backdrop of that, I think we've been more conservative probably in the last year perhaps than others because we think that we want to make sure we get a return on the customer. So that has led to looking at higher credit scores, which is probably the best correlation of a long-term profit subscriber. Certainly, a concentration more on rural America where there's more limited options.","And so we just looked at it. If it was your money which, you know, if it was your money would you invest in that customer, and if the answer is yes, we invest in the customer. If the answer is no, probably not. And I think we probably made some mistakes the last several years in the past and we're probably done very similar things to other people in the industry and got subs and didn't think it would be long-term and really take into consideration the changing dynamics that are out there.","But on the same token, Roger and his team at Sling TV have said that in going to OTT, you're able to get a different class of customer, a customer who's not in the Pay-TV universe today or maybe was in the Pay-TV universe and left the Pay-TV universe in part because the costs were so high or they were paying for channels they don't watch, and the SAC is relatively low there. The churn obviously is higher, but they tend to come back over a period of time. They kind of go in-and-out, in-and-out. So the economics of those customers are interesting to us because we think there's a bit of a wider field to play there long-term for proper customers.","So it's not that we're giving up on linear satellite customers, it's still a great business. It still throws off a lot of cash and there's long-term customers that just aren't going to go anywhere given where they live, and there's a lot of synergy with how we do satellite broadband for those customers. But I think that we've taken a long-term view of it and spend money like a shareholder I think would want us to spend the money and invest in \u2013 at least at the time we invest in a customer, it's our belief that we have a high likelihood that will be a positive net present value customer, and as a result of that, we're more conservative on the DBS side. And so that is a \u2013 that in my opinion is mature to declining business nationwide and certainly a declining business at least in the short-term for us.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there a point where you see the churn and gross add dynamics stabilizing the business, or should we look at this being sort of declining business for the next medium-term three years to five years?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think that \u2013 I think there's two things. One is we may have a little \u2013 we probably had a little excess churn. Churn is what happens from what you did last year, not what you did today, right? So we probably had a little excess churn just based on some takedowns of programming and also maybe in my opinion maybe not the wisest decisions, a $19.99, $29.99 you're just not going to get an economical customer at those levels. So that will run through the company. A lot of it has. Some will finish up in this year, and then I think we're more disciplined about how we go about it. And so in that sense we could see some improvement.","But there's not that many new household formations where satellite and cable are the right product for them. If they have OTT options and they are younger they're just going to go to Netflix and Hulu and Amazon and hopefully people like Sling TV and others.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Charlie.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","The other piece that we have is \u2013 the other dynamic for us that's probably a bit more unique to DISH is that people do bundle, and they look for broadband in many cases first before they look for video. And so we're disadvantaged there vis-\u00e0-vis the cable industry. So that's why I think you've seen a better cable performance, for two reasons. One is they have some advantages in bundling, and the second thing is that they are downgrading people to lower tiers or maybe just the local channels in HBO for $15 and things like that. Those still count as a subscriber for them, and so they are less profitable customers, and less ARPU customers, but they still count as a subscriber.","We're not as focused on the number of subscribers we have, we're a bit more focused on the actual profitability of the subscribers. So that's just how we look at it and as a result of that, we're a very good cash flow business, it's going to continue, and we have a growth opportunity. We have a significant growth opportunity, in my opinion, on the OTT side that we should grow. Our goal is certainly between what Roger is doing at Sling and we're doing at DISH, we expect to grow as a company. We certainly hope to grow as a company on the video side and that's external to our wireless assets.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Maybe just extending this discussion, when we look at your Pay-TV stack it's been coming down and obviously that's partially reflected by the mix of Sling, but I was hoping maybe you could just provide a little color. What is the underlying acquisition cost structure of the satellite TV business? Is that actually becoming more efficient as you're more focused on customer profitability? And then just thinking a bit more about Sling. The product has been in the market for a year now. Anything you can do to give us some sense as to the size and the gross trajectory of that business or just key learnings in the last year, it would be really value added. Thank you.","R. Stanton Dodge - Secretary, Executive VP & General Counsel","Go ahead.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I'll try to answer, and then I'll turn it over to Roger on some of the Sling stuff. There hasn't been a material change in terms of the subscriber acquisition cost in the satellite TV industry. In fact, it may be in some cases, some of the promotions out there, not DISH, but others the cost may actually be going up because hardware is still expensive and there is still quite a bit of discounting going on. One thing we have done is we've moved pretty dramatically from starting people at $19 or $29 or $39, and most of our customers are coming in well north of $60.","So that they're not getting hit with these big increases in the second and third year, and it's borderline dishonest to run a $19.99 ad knowing that to the FCC's point about set top box and everything else, the customer's ARPU is going to be $80 or $90 or $110. So we've tried to take a more long-term approach, and be more upfront about that. And it appeals to certain kinds of customers, and those kind of customers tend to have a little higher credit score, tend to be a better long-term customer for us and we're probably not as competitive on the low-end at this point or the person who is looking for a great deal. But that person is going to be looking for a great deal every year and they call you and they want credits, and you go through a vicious cycle that is not as impressive.","And then on the Sling side, it's in some way a science project because there's a lot of complexity technically to it but we certainly believe it's a high-growth business and a wave of the future for class of customers we can't get today. For example, Sling TV works great in the city. Most people have high-speed broadband there. So in a New York City, in Manhattan, we can't sell a satellite dish there, but we can sell Sling TV there. So it brings up an incremental, truly incremental base for us and for our content providers. And I think we have three main challenges there, and then I'll turn it over to Roger, but we have \u2013 our biggest challenge is probably technical, how to make it work. Live TV is more difficult than \u2013 because you can't buffer it and do all kinds of things you can do to video-on-demand or ask video-on-demand or things like Netflix do, so it's a much, much tougher. There is all kinds of restrictions like blackouts and for sports and local channels and things that just don't exist in the VOD world.","So it's very complex. We're learning a lot. We're on a lot of different devices. Those devices get replaced by new devices and you still got to maintain support for the old devices. So we've learned a lot and we probably think we'd do different, knowing what we know today, but those lessons reminds very much of when we started DISH Network, it took us a couple years to really go to sleep at night knowing that we were more than a science project.","And the second thing is that we still would like to have two or three other content providers to participate in what we're doing at Sling and we think that obviously we can add incremental customers to them, and incremental income to them and incremental advertising and a new model that's going to be around for 20 or 30 years. And so we're working closely to try to find two or three people who also want to participate, and then we're probably be done for a while there.","And then we need our user interface, we started with 20 channels, now we have like 80 channels or something. So the user interface needs to be upgraded to help people search and get all the channels. 20 channels is pretty easy but when you start looking for 80, or 90 or 200 channels, you need something a little bit better. So, maybe turn it over to Roger in terms of where he's trying to go with it.","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","Yeah. I think, we launched Sling just a year ago and I think about back prior to \u2013 just prior to our launch, I'd say, we had questions about, would there be demand for this product because this is something new to market and that was certainly a risk.","And then, second big question is where would that demand come from? Would come from existing Pay-TV subscribers? Or would it come from people who don't have Pay-TV? I think those two questions have been answered pretty well for us.","First, there is demand for the product. We're definitely seeing that. And secondly, the vast majority of the subscribers we're getting are not \u2013 they are not currently Pay-TV subscribers. Either they've never had Pay-TV because they are 25 years old, and it never crossed their mind to \u2013 traditional Pay-TV, or they cut the cord sometime in the last one, two, three, four, five years ago. So, there are some who come from traditional Pay-TV, but that's small, relatively small.","So in our analysis this is quite good for the overall ecosystem, which was our hypothesis from the beginning is that we could grow subscribers overall for DISH Network and that OTT as a category would grow subscribers overall for the Pay-TV ecosystem. And so far, I'd say, the evidence we're seeing so far is that those that is happening.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And just, I'm curious, is there a timeline you have in your head for when you might start breaking out the financial impacts for Sling?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, this is Charlie. I don't think we have a timeline, but obviously that's something and as we move forward and get it to the point where strategically where we think it needs to be that's certainly something we will consider.","Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much. There's been a lot of high-level disputes in network bundling recently and a while ago the U.S. Court of Appeals preserved the bulk of the program carriage rules. I guess I'm wondering Charlie, what's next? What's Washington's appetite to revise those rules? And then I have follow-up? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure I totally under the question, something about bundling?","R. Stanton Dodge - Secretary, Executive VP & General Counsel","Yeah, let say \u2013 Tom, this is Stanton. In the immediate, what we're looking at today, the FCC is rule-making going on about \u2013 we're taking a look at the retransmission consent rules.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Yeah.","R. Stanton Dodge - Secretary, Executive VP & General Counsel","...so that's the biggest thing that is going on today. And, of course, we've been participating in that. I think there are some meaningful changes that can be made to level the playing field from where it is today.","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","By the way, that certainly is impacting; the retransmission rules are so one-sided to the broadcaster, particularly the network broadcaster that that's probably impacting customers, consumers way, way, way more than set top box rules. No matter what, in linear TV you're still going to have a set top box, right regardless of who is making it and somebody is not making it for free. And when you add a DVR to it and you add encryption to it and you pay for intellectual property, it's going to cost money no matter what.","But re-trans fees have gone up 300% in the last few years and continue to go up, and there's no competition to that and the rules guarantee the broadcaster a local monopoly. So it's out of balance from that. And that particular rule-making will have much, much more impact on consumers in my opinion than even set-top box rule even if they were to make the set-top box rules very aggressive, so.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","And of course, the Senate Commerce Committee in the last Congress introduced the Local Choice Act, which we wholeheartedly supported and we're optimistic and hope that they'll reintroduce that which effectively allows broadcasters to set their rate, allows consumers to decide whether they want to take particular broadcast stations \u00e0 la carte, which we think is great because it ensures that the stations that are important to consumers will remain up for those consumers.","And today, we live in a world where broadcasters have got billions of dollars of free spectrum, some of the most valuable spectrum, under the cloak that they would serve the public interest, and in fact what they do is they hold consumers hostage when it comes time to renew contracts, and some consumers lose their programming. And we just think that's ludicrous. We put forth many proposals to keep the programming up while we negotiate and remain somewhat optimistic that someday that will actually come to fruition to benefit consumers.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","The FCC has proven really unwilling to get involved here. Do you think that that has changed?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","It's hard to say. I mean, they have this rule-making going today, and we're hopeful that they will make meaningful changes. You know, that the heat has certainly been turned up on this over the last four to five years. The number of blackouts increase year-over-year, and last year, we had a particular situation where the FCC got immediately involved and actually seemed to really care. So hope springs eternal.","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","No, I think is \u2013 we'd like them to go further, but this has clearly been the best \u2013 if this is clearly been the best FCC and certainly in terms of looking at imbalances in the system.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Right. And then separately, DISH's fourth quarter subscriber-related costs per sub, per month were up about $5 year-over-year, fourth quarter over fourth quarter, hurting gross margin this quarter. How does that inform your approach to any upcoming renewals in carriage agreements? Thanks.","Steven E. Swain - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The subscriber-related costs last quarter, so fourth quarter 2014 benefited from a one-time reduction in subscriber and programming-related costs, so that was really the anomaly in 2014. We're on track, on a trend, if you will, the rest of the quarters. And so I would just follow that trend through 2016.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","But in terms of how it impacts, how you approach any upcoming renewals I was thinking? Thanks.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean \u2013 this is Charlie. It's pretty simple. We have actual consumer data for millions of our customers; real data, not Nielsen data, which we look at as well, but we know what the value of particular content is to our consumers, right? And as a generalization, viewership of most cable and network channels has been declining for the last two or three years with the advent of Netflix, and their numbers are going up, right? And then there's been, in general, more advertising on the linear channels that further frustrate consumers, and then they watch less because of the advertising. So that's a trend that we're not sure is going to change dramatically. And as a result, when programmers come in for a renewal, they typically just say we have a budget, we want a double-digit rate increase, and we look at it and say we should get a double rate decline based on your viewership. And so that leads to intense negotiations where 95 times out of 100 you ultimately come to a conclusion with the content owner. But we don't always because sometimes you're just so far off between what the content person thinks his content is worth and what our viewers think it's worth that we \u2013 that to protect our viewers, we have to take it down.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Yeah.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I think we're spending a lot more time thinking that, at this point, that this isn't \u2013 so we kind of \u2013 there's lots of creativity you can have. But if we take something down, we're probably not going to end up negotiating as we have in the past for the most part, because we've already made the economic decision that it's not worth it and so you just move on and get replacement programming.","So life has changed a little bit, particularly for some programmers, their content is available on other outlets. So if the majority of our customers today have Netflix then they probably have a lot of kids programming today they're paying for. And if they're paying for that kid programming, why should they pay for it again on us? And so they scratch their head when we go to them and say we have a price increase this year because our content cost went up. So if there is a science show and it's on Hulu or Amazon, they scratch their head. It is like 100 million people have Amazon potentially. So that makes negotiations difficult. But I think the way \u2013 really the escalating content fees, probably the balance has shifted now to some of the distribution people having more leverage than they did in the past because consumers have other outlets to get that content.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","All right. Okay, great. Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","But having said that, where we have relationships with content providers, particularly people supported us for 20 or 30 years, it would take a really, really material disagreement for us to not renew with a current content provider that has any kind of meaningful viewership. I mean, it would have to be a really big disagreement.","Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I have a question for Charlie and then one for Steve, I guess. Charlie, looking at where your stock is today, the market seems to be assigning a per megahertz top value of well below $1. So why not buy back your own stock instead of participating in the auction or just why not buy back your stock in general? And then for Steve, is there any way to help us think about cash taxes and CapEx for 2016 and beyond?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Steve take the second part. We certainly look at what \u2013 we're cognizant of our stock price, we're cognizant of a strategy that can have, as you mentioned, that could have some logic to it, depending on the point in time where you might be highly confident that the valuation is such that the best return you could do is to buy your stock back. We look at those things versus what you could do with the cash alternatively. So we continue to look at those things. And, again, I think our driving force in terms of management what we recommend to our board is what the long-term implications of doing those things are and then we balance the trade-offs of those things. So what you propose is logical. But there'd be a bunch of other data you'd have to look at to say whether that's the most logical, that's the highest priority for us. You want to take the second part, Steve?","Steven E. Swain - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, sure. Marci, so cash taxes and CapEx, so I'll give you a couple forward-looking items in my preamble. So one thing that we do do is amortize our licenses and the AWS-3 licenses. So that is a cash tax help going forward. And I also mentioned that cash interest paid, whether it's expensed or capitalized, is deductible. So there are a couple of helps as well as we take advantage of any accelerated depreciation or bonus depreciation in the tax department, and that's a variance from book. So there are a few helps going forward and that's really all I'm going to talk about on taxes.","CapEx, to the extent you do a variance between DBS activations and Sling activations, the DBS activations, as Charlie mentioned, SAC has been relatively constant on the DBS side over the past several periods, so just continue that trend if you see that going forward as well.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I just have a follow-up for Charlie based on the answer to my question. You seem to be very confident you still have a lot of options, and I think the market feels like either those options don't exist or they're much further out than what a lot of investors can handle. So is there any color, anything you can say today to give us confidence that there are still as many options in a reasonable timeframe as there have always been?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I mean, I think this hasn't changed since we went public in 1995 or 1996. As management, we are looking at things long term. So we're not looking at quarter-to-quarter so a shareholder can make money quarter-to-quarter. I mean, we're looking for long-term value for shareholders. We're making money over a long period of time. We're very fortunate in that regard because we don't feel any pressure for short-term gains, right? And so we can make long-term decision. As a result of that, there are more opportunities for us than a typical public company because we can take a little bit longer-term approach to it. And sometimes we're penalized in the short-term stock price for that, but that's a small price to pay if you're doing the right thing for your shareholders long term. And I'm selfish because I'm a long-term shareholder.","But we do the right \u2013 we try to do the right thing, so having \u2013 the other thing is I think we try to look at where the world is going to be three to five years from now, not where it is today. And as a result of that, I think we have a myriad of options to grow value in the company. And some of that clearly is going to be driven by what we do with spectrum and how we utilize that to grow the value of the company, and we've talked about all the things in the past that there are options there. And I think our value will be driven by how well we execute on OTT and how well we run a mature to declining business in linear TV and so that's how we look at it. And when you look at that, we feel pretty confident where we are and as well there's pressure on it when you're a $40 stock price and when you're an $80 stock price. So I think we can just go out there and do the right thing long term.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","And, obviously, the next six months in the wireless industry nobody's going to talk to anybody. I mean, there's very little that will happen, if anything, until people see what happens in the next auction. And then the deck will be \u2013 the table will be reset from where it is today and then some people will be pretty happy where they end up and some people won't be so happy, and somebody will have a strategy to go north and somebody else will say, just based on that, the counterstrategy is to go northeast or south or whatever, but we're well-positioned within that industry. And it's a little bigger \u2013 I hate to digress, but it's a little bit bigger than the wireless industry what everybody is thinking about it.","What you really got to think about it's really the connectivity industry, which is all the information is in the cloud and you got to connect to it. If you're going to be a living, breathing, productive human being or productive machine or productive industry or whatever, you're going to have to be connected. And the most efficient way, in my opinion, that you can connect, the most efficient way is through wireless spectrum. And it'll be all kinds of different frequencies, but you're going to have to connect. And the sweet spot of that, the most versatile spectrum in the toolbox is in that 2-gig range where we have the vast majority of our spectrum.","So if people don't want to connect, I'd probably stay up at night. If you believe that people aren't going to connect and use more data and want more information and want to know when they're going to have a heart attack before they have a heart attack or know how to save money on their electricity or whatever it's going to be, if you believe they're not going to want to do that then I don't \u2013 go buy some oil because they're always going to use that for a long time. So, I mean, I guess, it's the way we look at it, but I think we look at it a little bit broader than perhaps people are writing about today.","A lot of people focus on the here and now. There's an old story about Pel\u00e9. He was a good soccer player because he wasn't playing the ball, he's playing where it was going and that's I think what you have to do. I think that's the CEO and the board's job is to make sure that this company is where the ball is going, and I like where we're positioned based on that. But not for the next three months.","Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. Charlie, you might want to stay away from the comparison to oil. It's not looking so good these days.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, but they're still using it. And if oil \u2013 it's funny, if oil is not looking good, then how is solar energy and wind and all those things that weren't \u2013 they weren't economical when oil was at $80, now they're looking at $30. So there's always this \u2013 the new shiny car is always going to be better, right?","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","That's true.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","But when you really run the math and if you're an economist and you're running stuff on \u2013 and then you're going to come back to mid-band spectrum is pretty damn valuable. The new shiny car at 60 GHz is very interesting, but it's not going to do what you do at the mid-band frequency.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Right.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Again, solar is very interesting, but without the government subsidizing it \u2013 even with the government subsidizing it, it's probably not economical at $30 a barrel, but it's not economical until you subsidize it, so. So, I guess, that's my oil story.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","I appreciate that. Just a couple of things from my perspective.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","By the way, they are producing more oil. They're not making more spectrum, so...","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","That's true.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","If you had a choice, I wouldn't flip a coin.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","So, I guess, just thinking of the first thing I was interested in is your thoughts on the overall wireless industry structure, whether or not you think there is, in fact, a room for a sort of a fifth facilities-based provider? And then two more that might border on something you might not be able to answer, but just updated thoughts on your build-out requirements. We've got one approaching, I guess, in a couple of years. I know that it's not a hard-and-fast, you can push it back if you want to. But how do we sort of think about how you think about whether or not those initial requirements are a hurdle for you? And then just lastly with respect to the AWS-4 downlink decision, I think June 20 is your deadline. Just trying to get a sense if there's a benefit for you to wait till you get closer to that deadline, or are you just sort of biding your time?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, there's no hurry to make a \u2013 there's no reason to make a decision on downlink until we have to, right? Not that I think the world is going to change or our decision will ultimately change, but you never know.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Right.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So what was the other questions? Oh, build-out requirements, yeah, it's a bit complicated, and a lot of analysts get it wrong, but it's easy. Some of our spectrum has to be built out by \u2013 there's a deadline of 2020, some is 2022, some is 2026 or 2028. Some spectrum has \u2013 they still got to be cleared, and then it will have a date once it gets cleared. We don't see that today as anything that keeps us up at night. The nice thing about the spectrum build-out is I think that's interesting is we're starting to spend a lot more time looking at 5G because you're probably \u2013 realistically when you look at our spectrum being used, it's most likely to be used in a 5G format by however it gets used and however it gets built out, and so those timelines kind of match up.","You'd probably not think about building out an old technology. You wouldn't build out black-and-white TVs today. You wouldn't build black-and-white TVs today because everything's color. You wouldn't build standard definition TVs if everything is HD. So, in fact, you'd probably build 4K TVs today just because that's where it's going. So that's kind of the build-out schedule. And what was the other question?","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","We put out a note last week, Charlie, just sort of identifying some of those requirements, and I think we've got a pretty good understanding of the dates on it. I just didn't know if those interim dates meant anything or whether that's \u2013 you're just sort of...","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, the interim dates mean something only if you meet them. If you meet an interim date, then you have a longer time to \u2013 then it would be 2021, 2023. You get an extra year or two if you meet the interim dates. But because of the transition to MPEG-5 where you're seeing a lot of people talking about it now and testing it, and you'll see it at the 2018 Olympics, I mean, 5G, it's not likely that we would build out interim spectrum in 4G.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","That makes sense.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Or that anybody else would with us. I mean, that's probably \u2013 I mean, it's not impossible, and maybe there would be some testing there, but that would seem like a waste of money if a year or two later you could do 5G. Because 5G is going to be 10 times, 100 times, 1,000 times more efficient. It's going to allow for the Internet of Things in a way that 4G doesn't. So 4G was better that 3G, 3G was better than 2G, and 5G is a big leap. So you always want to \u2013 if you're going to build them, build it with the latest and greatest, particularly when you get those kind of efficiencies.","And then on the fifth carrier, I don't personally see a fifth operator in the United States unless it was something like a neutral hosting where the existing carriers could use it. So, in other words, it wasn't competitive with the \u2013 the competitive balance is pretty good. The government's kind of got it right. It's pretty competitive. It's pretty intense with four. Maybe the government always would like more, but there's a lot of CapEx involved, so four seems to be, at least for the foreseeable future, seems to be about where the sweet spot is. A lot of countries, it's three. Some countries, it's seven or eight, so it varies. But I don't personally think you could start a fifth network unless you are somebody \u2013 at least DISH couldn't. I mean, somebody of scale could, right? These companies that have money overseas that they could buy AT&T and Verizon tomorrow. So the world could change.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Right.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Operator, we have time for one more from the analyst community.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will now take our final question from the analyst community. We'll begin the media portion of this call following the answer to this final analyst question. Your final question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. I had two questions. First, I think you had $1.5 billion maturity due on February 2, I was just wondering how you handled that? If you repaid it with cash on hand and if there is any plan to refinance it? And then separately, on Sling TV, just wanted to ask you how you're thinking at this point about the potential addition of the broadcast networks to the service and if you could \u2013 I don't know \u2013 maybe talk about how those discussions with the broadcasters have gone? And as you come up with the Viacom renewal, is getting their content on Sling a big focus for you in the negotiations? Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","In terms of debt repayment, we sent a wire for the $1.5 billion.","Steven E. Swain - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We did repay it with cash.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","We repaid it with cash and it was on hand.","Steven E. Swain - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","U.S. dollars.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","So we tried to use Bitcoins, but they wanted cash. Just because of the auction, don't want to talk about financing, but obviously we have cash on hand to run our business today. The market liquidity has tightened up a fair amount in the last six months and certainly we were pretty conservative. I think we were five times levered, we're more like four times levered now. That just feels like a more comfortable spot to be based on our existing business.","For Sling, on the broadcast networks, that's \u2013 certainly, I think there's an opportunity for both Sling and the broadcast networks, but it's a bit complicated because there's O&O networks and then there's the affiliate and they are still fighting through their rights between the O&Os and the affiliates. So whether we would need to go to the affiliate and have an individual deal or whether the network itself could speak for the affiliates is unclear to us at this point and I think affiliates and O&Os all have different opinions about that. So they're working through that, although we do have a couple of networks from an O&O perspective that we do have the rights to today. So, I think that that's one of the things that's a challenge for OTT providers and Sling and could be a benefit to the networks and to the consumer, right, because they'll watch networks but they're expensive, so that's the other piece of it. And what was the other piece?","R. Stanton Dodge - Secretary, Executive VP & General Counsel","Viacom renewal.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Viacom renewal, well, look, I think any \u2013 we're taking a long-term view, so anytime we talk with the content provider, we want to know what their thoughts are on OTT and whether this is the way to \u2013 because we think OTT is additive to the content provider, we would scratch our head if the content provider \u2013 I understood three years ago where people may be skeptical looking at the business, but I think we've shown how it can work today to the benefit of the content provider. And I think that I scratch my head if content provider didn't want to play, but it has different values depending on whether it's live TV or VoD or SVOD or whether it's available on different platforms already.","So, it gets a little tricky because some content providers sell some of their programming to one of the OTT providers like Hulu or Amazon or Netflix and then we want to pay for it again, right. If you're watching that particular show, consumer shouldn't pay twice for it. And so some of the programming is chopped up a lot and makes it really difficult. And, again, some people will make great decisions in content and how they handle OTT and they'll be more successful and grow and some people will make mistakes.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Charlie.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","And we're just not...","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sorry.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","We're not the guys that get to make that decision.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","If I could just ask a follow-up on the broadcast side, I know that the affiliate network relationships can be complicated. Do you think it's just that they haven't sort of hashed out who has what rights or yet at this point or do you think that some of the networks have a different view strategically on whether they want to be on the OTT services? So, are some more motivated than others to kind of work with the affiliates and help to get them on board?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","It's hard to know. I mean, CBS sells theirs direct today. Through their All Access, so they probably maybe are less inclined. Other people I think would like to. I mean, the O&Os and the affiliate agreements are complicated, not primarily because of OTT, but because of reverse re-trans and their own renewals \u2013 they own renewals, right, with the affiliations because the network has options on where to go and in a particular marketplace if they don't get an agreement. So those are very complicated. We're willing to work with either party, either the affiliate or the owned and operated. We will work with either or both. Is that fair, Roger? I don't know.","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","Yeah. We look at a number of things in working with these content partners or potential content partners. As Charlie mentioned, one of the things is, is that content already available? Obviously, we look at it, is that content relevant for the target market we're going after, which is not the entire market? And the final thing is, is the programmer going to give us enough flexibility that we could actually package it in our products in a way that we'd want to do it. And so it's a little bit different for us than a traditional Pay-TV operator where they're trying to appeal to the broad segment of the market.","And there's a lot of content partners that have decided that they want to go direct, which is fine. That means from our standpoint it's a little less necessary for us to have them in the bundle because the devices that we're on, they're likely already on and so our customers can go get that content if they want or they've made decisions to distribute their content through other SVOD services, which again are on the same devices that we're on. So, again, makes it a little less necessary for us to bundle that content into our basic package.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Operator, you want to move to the media?","Operator","Yes, of course. We'll now take questions from the media. Our first media question comes from the line of Scott Moritz with Bloomberg. Your line is open.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Hey, guys. Thanks. Charlie, given your history with Sprint, I'm wondering if there's \u2013 if you see there's some scenario where you might be interested in purchasing their bond, say, if they were backed by some of their licenses?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I don't think I'd comment on that one. Yeah. I don't think we can comment on that. I'm looking at the lawyers.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Because it \u2013 I mentioned licenses?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","It's just that the anti-collusion is, we know what the rules are in anti-collusion, but we don't always know that people are going to go by the rules and not change them and that was a rule yesterday, but the new rule is today and we just better to be safe.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Got you. Maybe just shift to another question kind of following up on that last analyst question. But, is there a timeframe when you see the logjam for local broadcast might be worked out and you guys could bring that to Sling?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I would say \u2013 I think Sling is a potentially very powerful platform for all kinds of content owners, including broadcasters and that they can grow their businesses by taking advantage of a new technology and a new generation of people who aren't watching their content today.","And the second part of it is to do advertising in a model that's not obtrusive to or as obtrusive to the consumer, in a way that the ad can be interactive and more meaningful to consumer and more powerful for them. You can't have your, I don't think executives at broadcast networks have their head in the sand, they're seeing a lot of the advertising dollars go to Facebook and Google that used to go to them, and that trend is continuing. And there's a way for them to get a piece of that action, and a big piece of that action, and Sling has some solutions to that. So, I think, the progressive executives are very interested in terms of what Roger and his team are doing.","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg News","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shalini Ramachandran with The Wall Street Journal. Your line is open.","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal","Quick question for you following up on the Viacom thing. Viacom had said on its call that it has a short-term extension with you guys and I just wanted to ask whether you view that as a positive sign that you will hash out a deal with them to continue carrying their channels or is it still being worked out?","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I think it's a positive because they're not down. So I think it's positive, because I think that the approach that we really look at is, the problem you have when you take something down, you take something down and then you put it back up a month later or a week later whatever it is, you've already lost the customers that see that as valuable. So you really almost penalize yourself twice. So I think we've looked at the things strategically to say, for the most part on what I would term on non-essential programming, we'll have to make a decision one way or the other.","And we will do, I mean, my direction to people here is look for every \u2013 I don't want to look why we're not going to do a deal, and I want to look like we're going to do a deal, look for every reason to go do a deal. And the benefit of the doubt goes to our programming partner because they've helped us build our business. So that's what we're doing and Viacom is one of those long-term really long-term partners for us, and they helped us build our business, so it would take a lot for us to not move forward.","On the other hand, people have to be realistic that the viewership of their channel relates to the value of the channel and the availability of their content at other places to our consumers, they shouldn't be forced to pay for it twice. And by the way, we will other ways \u2013 we will make money as well to monetize your product. So, when you add all those things together, you put creative people in a room, you probably figured out. But...","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal","Got you. Thanks. And one more thing. I wanted to ask on, you guys had mentioned for a while that you would have some more interactive or targeted advertising on Sling, and there has been some time where some of the ESPN ad spots were dark and I wanted to ask whether that's going to change, and when we'll see that change?","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","Yeah, hi, Shalini. It's Roger. We are doing some dynamic ad insertion on some of the networks today, not currently as you pointed out on ESPN. And Charlie mentioned earlier on the call the live OTT service is a bit of a science project in that there is a lot of new technology, a lot of integration with third parties that has to go really, really well. And this is an example of the dynamic ad insertion where we have a number of third parties that all systems have to interact properly. So we've been doing a lot of work to make sure that we do dynamic ad insertion.","It is \u2013 it provides a benefit both to our programmers but also for our subscribers. It doesn't cause service issues on it and so I think we're close to having those issues solved and you'll see it come back on, but we're still in the development phase of finalizing some technologies and leads to be confident that we can redeploy it without causing service problems.","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal","Got it. Thank you.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","But, I agree with you, Shalini. It's very frustrating to see the ESPN commercial break thing. I'd rather see something moving. Part of ESPN is we have blackouts and things like that for ESPN that we don't have for other networks and that just causes \u2013 adds complexity.","Shalini Ramachandran - The Wall Street Journal","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Malathi Nayak with Reuters. Please go ahead.","Malathi Nayak - Reuters","Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Charlie and one for Roger. I start with Roger. Roger, some of the other OTT players are experimenting with sponsored content and I was wondering if you were exploring that in terms of Sling TV and bringing sponsored content on to the platform? And for Charlie, I was wondering if you had any advice to Sprint and SoftBank right now as they try to revive that business?","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","I'll start. I'll take your first one about sponsored content. Where we have experimented is running what we call traditional Pay-TV content, channels like AMC and ESPN and Food Network with nontraditional content that's available on Sling like; content from bigger studios. But really our focus in all of that is figuring out what our consumers and our target demographic really want to watch. It's not so much on can we get someone to sponsor content in a way that we could make money from the content. That's not our focus. Our focus is really on providing our service to the customers really want and content that they want to watch. So I think you'll see us do more experimentation with nontraditional TV content but, again, with a singular focus on finding stuff that really works for our consumers and what they want to watch.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I don't have any advice for Sprint and SoftBank. Other than, I think they have a good team in place now and it's very focused. And when you get a good team when you're focused, good things can happen. But it's a tougher environment because of liquidity out there, but we get our own. My job is to worry about DISH.","Okay. Operator, are there any other media calls in queue?","Operator","Yes. Thank you. Your final question from the media community comes from the line of Mike Farrell with Multichannel News. Your line is open.","Mike Farrell - Multichannel News","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I had two really quick ones. John Skipper I guess said yesterday that ESPN was talking with a lot of other OTT providers about getting their channels on their services, and the last Disney call, Bob Iger, spent a lot of time praising Sling and the relationship there. I'm just wondering if ESPN getting on a broader swath of OTT providers? So does that put you guys at a disadvantage? Or, I mean, how does that affect Sling?","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","This is Roger. Obviously, we've always expected to have competition in OTT. I'm a little surprised it's taken this long for the utility heads (1:05:10) to come in....","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well, bought Sony's into that.","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","Sony is into that. Yeah. It's true. But my expectation really with OTT is it's a new segment as long as other \u2013 as long as we're performing well, right? We need to perform well. We need to provide value to our, consumers. But other entrants coming in, we'll expand the market even though we lose market share, right, right now we have probably fairly mature market share and if we'll lose market share, the market will grow faster and therefore we may grow faster.","So that's sort of if you look at new entrants and new markets that have developed that historically what happens is starts off slow development, you get an S-curve adoption, others come in, they grow the market faster and then at some point you have shakeout between the larger providers. So, we certainly expect that competition. We certainly expect that at some point ESPN will launch with other providers.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think the interesting dynamic will be the OTT players that come in that are outside the \u2013 they don't have material costs and infrastructure, right? So even a Sony, we don't a material cost and infrastructure, they're going to have different motivations about content. Amazon today makes no secret of the fact that they sell or trying to sell Amazon Prime and they use content as a way to sell shipping services and product, right?","For content guys that's a little scary because your product can get devalued because somebody wants to sell something else. So if somebody wants to sell hardware, they may devalue your, if they have no infrastructure, than it devalues everybody whose invested in infrastructure, which is a slippery slope for a content provider to go. And so I think that's the part that's most interesting to me to watch will be, it's not only when and if somebody gets in, but who it is. And are they, do they have infrastructure, or is there motivation to monetize something other than content?","Mike Farrell - Multichannel News","Great.","R. Stanton Dodge - Secretary, Executive VP & General Counsel","All right. Thanks, guys. Thanks, everybody.","Charles William Ergen - Co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"7200":["DISH Network Corp (NASDAQ:DISH) Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call April 20, 2016 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Stanton Dodge - General Counsel","Steve Swain - CFO","Paul Orban - CAO","Erik Carlson - President & COO","Charlie Ergen - Chairman & CEO","Roger Lynch - CEO, Sling TV","Tom Cullen - EVP, Corporate Development","Analysts","Tuna Amobi - S&P Capital IQ","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs","John Hodulik - UBS","Jonathan Atkin - RBC Capital Markets","Kannan Venkateshwar - Barclays Capital","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Michael Morris - Guggenheim Securities","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities","Walter Piecyk - BITG","Alex Byers - POLITICO","Jimmy Schaeffler - The Carmel Group","Scott Moritz - Bloomberg","Operator","Good afternoon. My name is Chris and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the DISH Network Corporation Q1 2016 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Stanton Dodge, you may begin your conference.","Stanton Dodge","Thanks, Chris. Thanks for joining us, everyone. I am Stan Dodge, General Counsel of DISH Network. Jason is out today but I am joined by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman and CEO; Erik Carlson, President and COO of DISH Network; Tom Cullen, our EVP of Corporate Development; Roger Lynch, CEO of Sling TV; Bernie Han, our EVP of Strategic Planning; Steve Swain, our CFO; Paul Orban, our Chief Accounting Officer; and Bob Toevs, our Vice President of Corporate Communications. Before we open it up for Q&A, we need to do our Safe Harbor disclosures. We ask that media representatives not identify participants or their firms in your reports. We also do not allow audio taping and ask that you respect that.","All statements we make during this call that are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements which involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from historical results and from any future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a list of those factors, please refer to the front of our 10-Q. All cautionary statements that we make during this call should be understood as being applicable to any forward-looking statements that we make wherever they appear. You should carefully consider the risks described in our reports and should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements which we assume no responsibility for updating.","As part of the process for the broadcast incentive auction, we filed an application to potentially participate as a bidder for those spectrum aspects. Because of the FCC's anti-collusion rules, we're not able to discuss what, if any, spectrum resources we may intend to bid on and we will not be answering any questions about the incentive auction during today's call.","Operator, we will now open up the call first for analysts Q&A and then media Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi from S&P Capital IQ. Your line is open.","Tuna Amobi","Just real quick, first, on interest expense, it seemed like there was a major swing there in terms of capitalized interest. I know you had alluded to that in the last call. But I'm wondering if this is the steady-state that you would expect for the rest of the year or are we likely to see other swings in the coming quarters for the rest of the year?","Steve Swain","You're right. I mentioned it on last quarter's call. Because our total spectrum carrying value is approximately $15 billion, effectively all of our interest expense will be capitalized off of our income statement throughout 2016.","Tuna Amobi","And is that likely to continue beyond 2016 or is that it?","Steve Swain","It is likely.","Paul Orban","This is Paul. It will continue as long as we're commercializing or developing a spectrum.","Tuna Amobi","Okay. Separately, I know you recently launched your Hopper 3 DVR. I'm wondering if you can update us what you're seeing there and the strategy there. Any implications it might have for your upgrade expenses, et cetera, that would be hopeful. And is that a material -- I know there is some material enhancements in there but is this something that would move the needle in terms of potential upwards, as well? That would be helpful, thanks.","Erik Carlson","Obviously we want launched the Hopper 3 at the end of January and we're seeing good penetration. The Hopper 3 obviously is a good set-top box for us. It has 16 tuners, 2 terabyte hard drive and really has improved the television viewing experience for our customers.","Charlie Ergen","Go back to expense and SAC, does it have an effect on us.","Steve Swain","For the expense and SAC, it is a little bit of a more expensive box. But overall we're using a higher percentage of remanufactured receivers as a percentage of activations, so the overall equipment cost per activation is down on a year-over-year basis.","Tuna Amobi","And Roger, can you talk about your recent launch of the multi-stream offering and what you are seeing there? Any potential impact that you expect it to have in terms of the overall economics of the service?","Roger Lynch","Sure. We launched it in beta just a week ago, so it is very early in the launch of it. The timing of that was important for us because we had the new Fox deal and baseball season starting, we have a lot of good baseball content on there. We expect, through the beta phase of it, we may add some more channels and probably keep it in beta maybe up to a couple of months, depending on feedback we get from customers and what we do with other launches. So, it's too early to really give much commentary on the launch.","Charlie Ergen","But you can say consumer feedback on single. This is Charlie. Consumer feedback on single-stream was, many of them wanted a multi-stream product.","Roger Lynch","Sure, yes. And they wanted Fox channels so we answered that with multi-stream service, both of those questions.","Tuna Amobi","Okay. And, lastly Charlie, can you update us on your current thoughts on the landscape? I know there is not much you can say regarding the auction, but there is probably some unresolved questions around the impact of the DE from the last auction. And I'm wondering, you've disclosed that you're going to be participating, have your views changed dramatically over the last several months as to how you see your role in the environment? And any updates you can provide strategically regarding your wireless options would be helpful. Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","I think I'm pretty limited on talking about wireless. But the overall industry that we participate in as a company is pretty broad from terrestrial wireless to satellite and everything in between. Nothing has really changed there since our last conference call or two conference calls. We're going to talk a little bit more about it. Obviously linear television is a mature to a declining business, challenged in terms of ever-increasing programming prices and lower viewership, continued low viewership in general. Some people are doing a little better than others but there's, in general, lower viewership. There is obviously a whole generation that, they're either not paying for TV or if they're paying for TV it's more likely to be a Netflix or Prime or Hulu or some combination of those.","So, there is opportunity there. And Roger and his team have positioned DISH quite well to work with current content providers to give them an avenue to go into that space and start to get that generation paying for more TV, particularly as they get into their first house or their first apartment and so forth. So, rather than lose that generation we want to go get that generation and I think we're well-positioned. There is also, one thing that is a little bit different about our industry, we're believers in the two-revenue stream, both advertising and a monthly fee for content. We still think that's a good model. It's a good model for our content providers and we think OTT can play a significant role there with more targeted ads, maybe a lighter ad load that's acceptable to consumers. Hulu has done a lot with that with some success.","The other parts of the world, the world is becoming more and more in need of being connected and we're continuing to make the transition to a company that is a connectivity company. And we connect you through satellite and we're going to connect you through wireless. There is not another way to universally connect people. It's interesting to see that -- I think the report came out yesterday, 20% of people are connected totally wireless in their lives and don't have a physical wire to their house anymore. And that trend is increasing. And there is lots of new technologies that we're well aware of and even have some spectrum ourselves in terms of millimeter wave and things like that. We're quite optimistic about the building block that we have as a company, where we're positioned with those building blocks.","Obviously we'll be able to talk a lot more about where we're going once the incentive auction is over. We've implied that we potentially will participate but whether we participate or not we're going to be in a quiet period until that auction is over. We like strategically where we're. It is up to us to execute. It is up to us to have the courage not to throw good money after bad. As an example, we no longer really have a $19.99 product. We really start off at about $50 a month for a customer. A $19 a month customer is not a profitable customer for us given the SAC, so it doesn't make sense to chase that just for a number on the balance sheet. We'd rather chase for a number that is positive cash flow and get some positive return for us. We don't care whether that is an OTT customer or linear customer. We think there is positive returns from both of them, although the trends are going to be more toward OTT, in our opinion.","Tuna Amobi","Just for clarification, Charlie, on the connected theme that you just mentioned, the connected connectivity, do you see the connected car a future opportunity -- telematics, things of that nature or not?","Charlie Ergen","Certainly cars are going to be connected. I'm pretty sure you're not going to connect a car to a cable or wire so the only way that I know you are going to connect a car is wirelessly. If it is going to be wirelessly, you're going to have to have some spectrum to do that. There is a lot of difference parts of that. Some is collision avoidance, some is the connection, what you're doing while you're in the car, particularly as you go to autonomous cars when you are not actually driving.","We've thought about that, others have thought about that and we think we're positioned to participate in all kinds of connectivity and cars is just one of them. And I'd just further say, the world is about to change from 300 million handsets in the United States to 30 billion connected devices, that's a big change. And all those connected devices are going to potentially be income-producing for people in the industry. So, that's a big change in terms of where things are going.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman. Your line is open.","Brett Feldman","I'll go ahead and ask a question about Viacom. Based on your disclosure in the queue it sounded like they made the decision to walk away and that you guys are still pretty far apart. Could you give us maybe a little more color here? Is this simply a dispute over price or are you asking for different types of conditions in these carriage agreements as you think about how your business is evolving, particularly around Sling?","Charlie Ergen","Normally, I don't like to negotiate in the press. Let me give you some background there. We were on a short term extension with them that kept rolling as we negotiated in good faith. I think that they also maybe decided, they had the right, as did we, to send final notice which they did. So, as midnight tonight our programming contract will expire which means that absent a new agreement we would take down their channels. It's no coincidence that our conference call is today because, to the extent that we obviously don't reach agreement, we're prepared to move on as Suddenlink and others have done, without the content.","Having said that and last week I would say my impression was I didn't see a path with Viacom. I think that the tone on both sides, both Viacom and at DISH, has been more productive through the weekend and this week, so there actually probably is a path to continue carriage, but it's not done yet. And obviously the devil's in the details. The big difference is really philosophical. We look at real data. It's been seven years, I think, since we did the last Viacom deal. We look at viewer measurement for all their content over the last seven years and we look at the price we pay. And we evaluate that with other content providers we have. We try to protect our customers from two things, one a needless price increase and, two, paying for product that they are viewing other places.","So, if you're watching some content but you also get it on Netflix or Hulu or Prime or you get it on the Internet or you get it on their website or whatever, it doesn't make sense to pay for it twice. In general, Viacom is not alone in this. Viewership for linear cable TV channels is down. In general, content is more widely available and therefore the value to us and to our customers is generally down. Now that's our side of the story. I think the content providers would say we're still giving you a very valuable product, it's great deal for the consumer when you think about all the content they get for the price they pay. And we have existing contracts and other things where we have people who have shown that they are willing to pay based on more historical rates than on viewing trends.","So, you have to get together and go through that and we're in the process of doing that now. We don't know whether we will get to a deal, but I do see a path now that I didn't see last week. One of two things will happen at midnight tonight, is their program will be up or their program will be down. We're not mad at them. If they come down we're not mad at them. We've enjoyed the relationship. They been a good partner. Their content is good content. It's just that we couldn't get to an agreement. We get to an economic point of indifference, you can imagine, where there is a price where, if we paid a penny more we would say we actually make more money long term by taking it down. I think we're pretty good at analyzing those situations.","And by the way, we would always overpay a little bit for content because of the disruption. But we wouldn't overpay astronomically to avoid the disruption because long term we would be in a stronger position than our competitors because we wouldn't have to raise prices to our consumers long term. Anything you do as a takedown is short term in nature if it is not the right deal. I think the people who have taken Viacom down in the past have done just fine. They certainly had some short term disruption but I think they've done just fine. And I won't will speak for them but to the best I can tell they don't regret the decision. We have a long history, we would like to get a deal done, we see potentially a path to get it done, but we don't have a deal done.","Brett Feldman","Do you feel like the experience at Suddenlink and some of those others had when they made that decision, is it a reasonable framework for thinking about what your business could go through over the next few quarters if you ultimately could not reach a conclusion with them?","Charlie Ergen","I think we have real data, rather than rely on -- obviously they are one data point that's in general pretty positive. But the data we really look at would be the viewing, how many of our viewers view X amount of hours of Viacom content. Those are the people that are going to be impacted. And then the people who don't watch that much content would rather not have a price increase, so that's a positive. You have to balance those two things. I value the relationship.","Steve and his team are looking at the math. I'm looking at it, is there a relationship with Viacom that helps us as a company and helps Viacom go forward for new sources of revenue in wherever the world is going. And is that a relationship that is worth continuing to pursue. And if it is then you've got to try to figure out how you make it work. But we don't get to make all the decisions. They are the ones that have sent us the termination notice.","Brett Feldman","One last follow-up on this, you generated a lot of cash in the first quarter, probably more than a lot of people thought. You are in a very good liquidity position. Are you comfortable that your cash position, your cash generation is sufficient to get you through the year regardless of the outcome of Viacom?","Charlie Ergen","Yes. In fact, to some degree, probably that be -- anyway, we're comfortable with the cash position one way or the other.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open.","John Hodulik","Charlie, as you know AT&T announced that they're going to launch some over-the-top video service bundled with wireless in the fourth quarter. So, a couple of questions, one, how do you think that will change the competitive landscape in video? And do you think that kind of a bundle, putting over-the-top with wireless, makes sense? And, lastly, if that is the direction the industry is heading, given your mix of assets how does it change the equation for you? You have obviously a lot of assets on the video side but a lot on the spectrum side. How do you expect the market to evolve and how do you think it affects the value of those assets?","Charlie Ergen","I think the one reason Roger started on OTT was, the original thing was to put the content to mobile phones. Obviously you know that mobile advertising is a huge part of the advertising ecosystem today. And we know that viewing for millennials and younger people is predominantly not on a television set now. But to do it you had to put everything in the cloud. So, as we got into putting everything in the cloud we realized there was actually a business there through a wire, as well.","So, I think what AT&T is doing is logical. I think what they are doing will advance the industry. And I think that DISH thought about it five years before they did. I think we're well-positioned to compete against whatever it is they come up with. But I think AT&T is well-positioned. I think their acquisition of DirecTV gives them scale in video and gives them the ability to do some things with video that other people in the wireless industry can't do.","John Hodulik","Do you think it eventually forces the cable companies to go out of region with their own over-the-top product?","Charlie Ergen","That might be a logical move for them. That's not something that the cable industry has chosen to do in the past but perhaps they would this time. I don't know.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Atkin from RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Jonathan Atkin","I was interested in the wireless spectrum around the carrier road map for 5 gig and 3.5 gig and how you view that as an interested outsider as it pertains to the AWS4 holdings. What are the puts and takes of those assets that are at carriers versus what you have? And then, secondly, if you could give us an update on the hardware or OEM ecosystem. How quickly would it take to develop terrestrial gear for cell-site deployment for AWS4. Thank you.","Tom Cullen","This is Tom.","Charlie Ergen","You're probably going to be limited, Tom.","Tom Cullen","Yes. Again, we're being cautious about discussing spectrum and industry structure and so forth. But a couple comments, one, I think, given the consumption trends on wireless devices and the proliferation of video, most people in the industry believe you are going to have to really throw every resource you have at solving the problem in the long run. So, there is going to be a role for certainly in the mid-band capacity spectrum that we have but there are also roles for continued densification. Millimeter wave has gotten quite a bit of attention in the last few months. As Charlie said earlier, we're familiar with that. Not only have we been talking and meeting with a lot of people that are in that space today, EchoStar, our affiliate company, also owns some LNBS licensing.","So, we may do some work around that. But clearly millimeter wave has its limitations. In today's world what's bringing more attention to it, I think, is massive MIMO, but that's certainly not a mobile architecture right now. It serves discrete purposes on point-to-point data or potentially small-cell back haul and things like that. Again, there's so many layers to the spectrum -- wedding cake, if you will -- that eventually they are all going to be deployed and put to use. As far as 3.5 specifically we're obviously very familiar with the proceeding. It will be a different licensing regime in terms of not only the term of the license but the size of the license areas. And then, of course, you have the unlicensed aspects of it, as well.","It's a little hard to predict the timing on all those things. I think it's pretty widely believed that 5G standards will be defined around 2018 and devoid around 2020. And then between now and then you will see continuous improvement in 4G. There will be additional 3GPP releases every year between now and then. As far as our effort to 3GPP, there's really no significant update since the last time we discussed it. The band 66 was approved in December. We would expect infrastructure equipment supporting band 66 to be available later this year and devices to follow that. And band 77 is currently a work item and that continues to move through the 3GPP process.","Charlie Ergen","Band 66, for those of you who don't know, is really our AWS 1, 3 and our AWS4 spectrum. So, that is going to be in virtually every phone in the not too distant future. That's a very big positive. And band 77 is our unpaired uplink with our AW--.","Tom Cullen","But the DE is unpaired uplink, paired with the other 20 megahertz of AWS4 as well as the downlink H block which is adjacent to it.","Charlie Ergen","So, that's going through the approval process. I think we expect that's going to happen this year and then it's got to get into devices and equipment. 3G takes time, for sure, but we've made a lot of progress there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. Your line is open.","Kannan Venkateshwar","Charlie, just a couple of questions, the first is obviously the Viacom issue is getting a lot of press and a lot of attention. But you also have a dispute going on with NBC which in many ways could be a bench line because it go through an arbitration proceeding. So, could you update us on how you're thinking about that process and what the timeline is around that?","And, also you mentioned in one of your comments that when you're negotiating with companies like Viacom early hurdles is that content is available, in many cases, like Netflix. The DOJ and the FTC have frowned upon the distributors looking at MSN clauses which prevent content from going into OTT platforms How do you navigate the regulatory environment when you're looking at these depressions? Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","The second part of the question is, there have been obstacles to deploying OTT that have been in the press. I don't believe that DISH has been involved in any of those obstacles. In fact, DISH has led the way to OTT. That is just something that content owners have to navigate through. I think that most content providers would like, as opposed to a few years ago when most content providers didn't want to experiment with OTT, most everyone wants to be certainly on the Sling platform today. And I think a lot of them are on the Sony platform and there are others.","Ultimately that will all get resolved. As far as NBC, NBC is not really an issue for us in the sense that part of the consent decree, when Comcast bought NBC, was that, to the extent that distributors and content providers couldn't reach an agreement, there's an arbitration process where the content stays available to all consumers while it goes to an arbitration process. As opposed to Viacom where maybe you get a deal, maybe you don't. With NBC we're confident that our customers are going to be able to get a fair deal either through private negotiations or through an arbitration process and those contracts are up from time to time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Phil Cusick","Hey, guys a couple if I can. Charlie, first on the DBS business, can you talk about the downsizing of that customer base? And is there a cohort of very price-sensitive customers who you feel like you are paring away as you take those interim prices up?\\ And is there an end date to that erosion? Or is this a slow decline across all the customer bases that continues for quite a while?","Charlie Ergen","The second part of your question I don't know the answer to. But the first part, we look at our customer, the total cost of that customer. It is the way we look at it. We look at, what does it cost to acquire that customer, how much programming did we give away free to that customer. And we add all that in. We add the cost of that programming into SAC. SAC numbers, in my opinion, are a little bit higher in our industry than people put on the SAC line on the income statement or on the 10-Q because typically in the past there has been free programming involved in that. And then we look at how often a customer calls and the variable costs that it costs to service that customer.","Some customers haven't called us in 10 years and some customers call us every 10 days and it cost you X dollars to answer your call. You look at the churn. High correlation of churn based on credit score. You look at those factors and what we would like to do is get a profitable customer and let's don't take a 50\/50 chance at it, let's take a 90% chance that we'll have a profitable customer. Because we have other places to deploy our capital where we think we have a 90% or 100% chance of getting a return. Probably one of the first things that I looked last year when I came back into the CEO role was really working with Steve and team to have the courage to go out there and get the right customers where I think there might have been a mentality here and maybe perhaps in other companies, where you're trying to show some number to Wall Street, but at the end of the day it hurts you long term financially. One of our rules is to think long term. ","So, we do that. There's been a lot more discipline in terms of what we do in the last year and I think that will pay dividends for us for years in the future. We still have some cleanup to do. It takes about two years to clean up. We're one year into a two-year process probably because you have people on two-year contracts. So, it takes a couple of years to clean that out.","Our industry, there is a lot of people moving away from $19.99. It is misleading to a consumer because there's not really a good $19.99 package. And I think others have moved away from $19.99 and I think that's a positive for our industry. I think other people and other CFOs will start looking at it the way we look at it at some point, I think. And that will be a positive but the general trend is that the weight of programming contracts where you have a huge bundle of programming even in your most basic packages is a long term negative for the linear industry when they have an alternative for OTT, whether that be Netflix or Sling or Sony or AT&T in the future or whoever. The consumer is going to win, the consumer is going to have more choice and we're going to be right there on the side of the consumer trying to build a product that they'll buy that we can make a profit at.","Phil Cusick","That leads me to the second question which is, as you think about if Viacom goes dark tonight, you mentioned you have other content ready to go there. Should we think about this as a Suddenlink style where they had other content ready to be signed and once it was gone it was gone or a little bit more of things you've done in the past where things go dark for a little while but there's still negotiations to be had?","Charlie Ergen","Our intent would be if they go dark they go dark. The only reason would be that we couldn't work together as companies. If we can't work together as companies on strategic things and building value between us and it gets into just a dollars and cents issue, then I'd rather spend my time with companies who are a bit more forward thinking than that and are willing to try and experiment with some stuff. Disney, when it came to the first big player to go to OTT, we've got a lot of loyalty there. That's a company who is thinking outside the box and trying some different things. Fox, who has led the charge on multi-stream with us, that team is now thinking of new ways to do things. That can be a very productive relationship because when you start having those kinds of strategic discussions you can start getting into things that aren't zero-sum games. ","You start thinking about things where both of you make money, incremental money, that you wouldn't have otherwise made. Just a negotiation with a company like Viacom, if it's just about dollars and cents it's totally a zero-sum negotiation. They want a penny more, we want to pay a penny less. If that is all we're going to do and we can't reach -- we're fine if that is what they want to do and we agree on the penny, but I'm a bit more interested in where would you go with your content and do we both make more money and how do we change the advertising model so we have a better second stream there that isn't obtrusive to customers. And we think we know how to do that. We have a lot of ideas. We don't have all the ideas but we have a lot of ideas on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Michael Morris","Two topics, one just following up on the Viacom issue and the content question, would you consider, if you were to discontinue carriage of Viacom, if they were to pull the signal, would you consider helping subsidize perhaps a Netflix subscription, even maybe like a one-month free trial or something like that for your customers to help display to them that there is similar content available elsewhere? That is the first question.","And then, second on Sling, can you share any insight on churn for that product? Maybe share with us how churn on Sling compares to churn for traditional DBS subscribers and whether you saw any increase in churn for Sling around the end of the football season. Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","I will let Roger take the Sling question. But on the discounting, we've done a promotion with Netflix, so we're pretty aware of the power of Netflix and the content that is there., As an example, they have an awful lot of children and family programming that's pretty easy to access. In fact, if you're about two and a half you can pretty much navigate through the product. We've done some promotions and stuff with them in the past. It's interesting to see that Amazon has gone to a monthly fee now which fits more into our consumer's model. I think there are a lot of alternatives there for consumers.","Roger Lynch","The customer lifecycle for Sling is very different from satellite. A satellite subscriber, they come in, they sign a two-year contract so you fairly low churn during those two years and maybe a little bit higher when their contract ends. For Sling it really flips the model on its head because we can allow people to come in, in a free trial. So, the switch from free trial to pay, if you want to think about it as churn, is the highest churn that you'll have.","And then the first month as a paid subscriber is the second highest and then the third month is the third highest and then it drops down. And then once customers have been with you six or seven months the churn rate is quite a bit lower overall. So, when we look at churn, we don't look at averages, we look at cohorts, to look at actually how those lifecycles are shifting. But in many ways it's the opposite -- until you get to customers who are long term. Long term customers with satellite tend to churn at a lower rate, long term customers on Sling tend to churn at a low rate.","Charlie Ergen","There is very little cost to sample Sling. It's one of the things that we work with our content providers to make sure they understand, is that you will get somebody who can go on the Internet and churn in and out of your content. It probably affects somebody like HBO or Showtime the most where you want to watch Game of Thrones and you want to be on for three months and you watch HBO for three months, where at HBO and DISH you might be on all year. But with OTT, HBO Go or whatever their HBO Now, maybe the average person is on for three months or six months. It probably affects the premium guys more.","We have to get better but there's ways to get better to make sure the customers pretty much come in and stay. Those are some of the things that we're learning. Those are some of the things that we're working with our content guys to help us with. But there's going to be more people coming in at low or no cost. And there's going to be higher short term during the first year of churn and then it is pretty stable. And I think Netflix, they had that same problem early on and they've gotten to a pretty steady state now. We're a long way from steady state, I think, at Sling, but.","Roger Lynch","The other thing we see is when customers come in for a free trial, even if they don't stay to, what we call, roll to pay, what we'll see is a pretty decent percentage of them will come back a few months later as a paid subscriber. To us, the more people we get to try the service the better because they either roll to pay which most of them do after the free trial or we find that a good percent come back a few months later as a paid subscriber.","Michael, you also asked about at the end of the football season, we didn't see a noticeable change in and again, we didn't see a noticeable change in that. What you do see is, when there is a big event like the national football championship you things like that, you'll have lots of signups with people, again, who come in, who want to watch the game, use a free trial to do that and that's okay. You may see a lower percentage of them that become paid subscribers at the end of their free trial but, again, you still see -- that then becomes a pool that we can remarket to and we end up finding a good percent end up coming back as paid subs in the subsequent months.","Charlie Ergen","And the whole experiment whether the trial period should be 7 days, 30 days, 14 days, 1 day, as we get a little better and a little more data on what the consumer experience is, we'll be able to better optimize how people sample.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Marci Ryvicker","Two questions, the first, the new Sling package that has Fox, we've been asked if there was anything related to Disney and that maybe going up against the Disney cap in the original Sling package or Disney having some sort of say that another sports network can't be in the initial Sling package, if that is why Fox is separate. And then the second question is, Sony's PlayStation view is starting to sign contracts with the networks to incorporate live broadcast. Where are you with live broadcast with Sling?","Charlie Ergen","Let me start with, as far as the multisport, we're talking to Disney. We would like to have Disney in the multisport product, multi-stream product. So far we haven't come to an agreement on that. One of the big things we're doing that we've learned is that when we did the single-stream product everybody came in under dynamic ad insertion was different standards, the way the content went to customers was different standards. For example, you couldn't pause some programs. Some programs you couldn't start over at the beginning. ","Sometimes you didn't have look-back rights. With multi-stream, everybody that is in multi-stream, we just made the strategic decision that we have to get a consistent product to our consumers. That's something that Disney is evaluating as to those standards and making sure they are comfortable with those. I'm optimistic that they'll decide to ultimately partner with us there because they've done such with Sony and many of the things we need to multi-stream they've already done before. If not, our customers, they can buy both the PSS and the MSS product and some customers do that, the single-stream and the multi-stream.","They can buy both and they can get both. But it's more about some of the lessons we've learned and making sure that everybody works the same so that we have a much better service for our customer, it's consistent, it technically works better than the way we started with single-stream where there were no standards and we were breaking new ground. In hindsight, there's probably a lot of things I'd do differently there.","Roger Lynch","And also, Marci, you asked about the broadcast networks. In our multi-stream service we do have Fox in their owned and operated markets. In our single-stream service today we have ABC in the owned and operated markets as an add-on tier. And Univision we have in both services. I think that's a complex situation because the affiliates have to negotiate the rights from the national networks to be able to grant the streaming rights. And I think those relationships are just in the process of getting sorted out.","And I think ABC made an announcement recently about how they are trying to do. I think all of them are trying to work through the issues. My expectation would be that those issues will get worked through and increasingly you will see locals as part of services like this including affiliates. But it's not something where you can wave a magic wand and do one deal with one company and all of a sudden have all the affiliates. It is one where it will take some time to work through.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Walter Piecyk of BTIG. Your line is open.","Walter Piecyk","Charlie, Rich is obviously chomping at the bit to do a follow-up on Viacom, but before I yield my time over to him can you give us any sense of how large the down payment is going to be for the incentive auction? And this goes back to, I think, the cash question which you were about to answer a little bit more to Brett on that. When your deck came due you used cash. Obviously you generated some cash this quarter. The debt markets might be a little bit more favorable versus when you use your cash to pay down the debt. ","So, I just want to understand, in the week or so that's coming, if we see you guys hit the market with some debt, is this indicative of the size of the down payment you might be using for the auction? I know you talked about maybe not wanting to bid but preserving some flexibility if the price is right obviously has some value. So, if you could just address that. And then I'm sure Rich is going to fire him with some Viacom questions.","Tom Cullen","Walt, it's Tom. We can't give any indication of a down payment size that we would make because that would indicate something about our intent in the auction. So, unfortunately we can't answer that.","Walter Piecyk","Can you answer at least on the financial size? Should we be shocked if you would take advantage of the debt markets the way they are today versus when you paid down your debt previously?","Tom Cullen","Good try. Love taking your questions, good try. We can't comment.","Walter Piecyk","Okay. When you look at Viacom viewership, I'm curious, it's been seven years I think since you cut your last deal with them. Could you comment on how much viewership of Viacom's collected networks are down over that seven-year period? And, also, they say that 19% of total watch time on DISH occurs on Viacom channels. Is that factually accurate? And then just a question for Roger on Sling, ESPN is not in the multi-stream but Fox is. Is there a way for you to put both Disney into multi-stream and Fox into single-stream and keep the price point? Or does that price point ultimately have to go up?","Charlie Ergen","Look, this isn't again unique to Viacom but in general programmers, viewership has gone down. You see the Nielsen ratings which aren't always completely accurate but they're close enough that they're good data points. Viacom, we don't have anything that would indicate that Viacom today would be anything like that number on our network.","Walter Piecyk","Meaning the 19% is not an accurate reflection?","Charlie Ergen","I would say that seven years ago Viacom was stronger on our network than they are today. And they still have valuable stuff. I'm not trying to -- I think they still have good content. But, in general, I would say that they suffered some from their product being more overly distributed than others. It's not product that you have to watch in general live and kids, some of their focus has been on kids and kids is a pretty, particularly with Netflix, diluted genre. The things that maybe haven't declined is NFL.","Walter Piecyk","But if ratings are going down why are prices not going down?","Charlie Ergen","I think what will happen is, is that ultimately the price -- ultimately what will happen, in my opinion, is what happened with the Los Angeles Dodgers, is somebody over-reaches and thinks that the Dodgers are worth whatever they said they are worth and people look at it and say -- no. Unless we own the Dodgers we can't pay that kind of money. You've seen Comcast drop YES Network. We carry it on Sling but we don't carry YES on DISH. It becomes a price you can't pay. And people will drop and once somebody drops, everybody -- then it's almost an possible negotiation for the next negotiation because somebody's got leverage on you.","The world is changing a little bit to where distribution -- it's starting to be a fairer fight. But the industry hasn't worked through the balance between cost of content and viewership. There's going to be some food fights between any number of companies and content providers in the future, probably, would be my guess. You've seen it with YES, you're seeing it with the Dodgers, you see it with -- I think Comcast just rolled Spike up to a very high tier, low penetration. I think they rolled country music television up. You've seen Skinny Bundles by Verizon, that's where it's going.","Ultimately it will reach its equilibrium and so forth. We're trying to provide different alternatives for content people to take advantage of those trends and not suffer from those trends. You can put your head in the sand or you can go out and say the world has changed, let's go change with the world, let's try to be innovative and that's what we're trying to do.","Roger Lynch","Rich, on your question about ESPN, let me just start with talking strategy about single-stream versus multi-stream. We think those products help us reach different target audiences. When we launched Sling TV, to me, the main thing we were doing was market segmentation which the pay-TV industry really had never done because the structure of the industry is such that everyone basically has the same channels at similar costs, so you end up with similar packages and similar pricing.","So, first and foremost, I think what we do on Sling TV is segment the market and go after different segments. We did that with single-stream and we'll do that with multi-stream. What that mean is we won't put all the content that's in multi-stream into single-stream and just have the number of streams be the differentiator because you'd end up with packages that would cost too similar. To answer your question specifically, no, we couldn't put all of the Fox content into single-stream and maintain the price point that we had. And the same, vice versa, we couldn't put all the stream content into the multi-stream service and maintain our price point. You're just driving up the cost too much for those. Our strategy will remain to have a single-stream product and a multi-stream product and have them target different segments of the market.","Charlie Ergen","But we're desirous of putting ESPN in multi-stream which will drive the price of multi-stream up. They are our first OTT partner so they get preferential treatment.","Roger Lynch","We would welcome ESPN and Disney into the multi-stream product.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first media question comes from Alex Byers of POLITICO. Your line is open.","Alex Byers","I wanted to ask a little bit about cable partners. The Charter deal looks like it is going to happen, though obviously we don't know for sure right now. But interested a little bit in your broader take on that issue. Reading some of [indiscernible] and then back to Comcast deal, as well, you almost get the sense that there's no room for cable mergers because no matter what, unless you had really small companies merging you would still have this increase for the potential of foreclosing against online video distributors, whether it was an MSN KPM thing or whether it was an inter-connection issue. I just see a lot of these issues potentially pertaining to future mergers and wanted to get your sense on if that was a good read in terms of what you [indiscernible].","Stanton Dodge","This is Stan. I think you're generally right. Whenever you have large players coming together you're going to see the issues that cause us concern. Charter Time Warner, in many respects, quite frankly, any merger speak to me of -- and Charter particularly, when you think about it -- post-merger Charter would be the dominant broadband provider in many of our country's largest and most important geographic markets such as New York, LA, Dallas, just to name a few. ","What is troubling also, those guys control broadband access along with Comcast to the vast majority of American homes, when you're talking about speeds of 25 mgs or more which is the FCC's definition of high speed. It would be about 70% to 90% of the country. Those two companies together, they don't even have to act consciously together, they can just act parallel and everybody in the country effectively will suffer.","Similarly, Charter said about two-thirds of the customers in their footprint won't have access to any competing broadband services of 25 mgs or more. So, if they decide to mess with OTT providers like Sling TV, our customers actually have no options to go somewhere else. Those three factors alone cause us great with concern. As we've publicly stated, we don't think the merger, for those reasons and others, serves the public interest. The amount of broadband consolidation is very troubling and puts serious harm on the OTT market, particularly our Sling services.","Alex Byers","So, you see those issues being potential hang-ups in future mergers?","Stanton Dodge","Yes. When you have two large players, as I said every merger is unique but when you have two large players coming together, I think it's hard to envision scenarios where you don't have similar concerns. The sad fact is, as we all know, behavioral conditions as part of merger approvals don't have a very good track record and they're very difficult to enforce. Ultimately it's the consumer who suffers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Schaeffler of The Carmel Group. Your line is open.","Jimmy Schaeffler","This is a question for Charlie and Tom. I'm interested in your forward thinking and your longer term thinking, your out of box thinking about licensed versus unlicensed spectrum and the pros and cons, the preferences, the strategies around that.","Charlie Ergen","This is Charlie. I think both have a place in where I would see connectivity going. Unlicensed, there can maybe be more innovation. There's a lot of advantages to it. There are a lot of disadvantages because there's not a lot of rules around it and there's a lot of interference. Both will play a role. I think it's back to what Tom said. The spectrum, the wedding cake layers of spectrum, all work together. I would say it this way -- it's a transportation system. Just think about a transportation system, Jimmy and you're going from San Diego to Denver, you can drive, you can take a train, you can fly. And if you want to get here quick you are probably going to fly. If you want to go absolute cheapest way you are probably taking a bus.","So, each part of the spectrum world is going to be part of the transportation system and it's going to include many different forms, some that needs low latency, some that needs high latency; and some that needs low power, some that needs high power; some that needs a phone call where you've just got to make it work versus some data that can afford to slow down; and some data, like healthcare, that can't afford to slow down or a car where you can't afford to have latency and you have to be 100%. It's all going to be different. When you put that system design together, you'll need a lot of building blocks. And probably no company in the United States really has everything they need for that, but we'll see.","Tom Cullen","Jimmy, the only other comment I would make, obviously there's been a lot of discussion around LTEU. That's a non-standard approach and then LAA is moving through standard. It is pretty well known that at the Wi-Fi level, certainly at 2.4, it's already getting pretty crowded and increasingly at the 5 gigahertz level. For a carrier that has a wired licensed anchor, by adding LTEU or LAA you're not only able to provide improved quality of service but you have visibility to the session when it goes from one network to the next where they don't have that today.","So, it creates interesting opportunities for those that have licensed spectrum and the unlicensed bands as I said earlier, there's going to be very good uses for 3.5 and 28 and 38 and 60, but the use cases will vary. You can imagine at 60 gigahertz, having very short range movie downloads where you can do an HD movie in six or eight seconds to a device. That creates all new applications. The extension of that to the mobility layer is still a ways off.","Jimmy Schaeffler","And just one more quick question -- do you guys see yourselves ultimately getting closer and closer to the [indiscernible] of 3.5 million subscribers today?","Tom Cullen","You broke up a little bit. What was the question?","Jimmy Schaeffler","I'm doing that traveling from Arizona to LA that Charlie was talking about [indiscernible]","Charlie Ergen","Jimmy, you are breaking up. I think the question was, do you see us playing in fixed wireless.","Jimmy Schaeffler","Yes.","Charlie Ergen","We will continue to monitor it. We did some trials with Sprint a couple of years ago at the 2.5 band. There will be, I think, an increasing use case for fixed wireless in the higher millimeter wave bands. But, again, that's distance limited but at one- to two-mile radiuses, you could probably do something on a point-to-point basis that could provide pretty impressive speeds. And I'm sure you'll see more of that occurring. As I said, there is a lot of buzz in the industry right now about how to potentially deploy 28 to 39.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Scott Moritz of Bloomberg. Your line is open.","Scott Moritz","A Sling question, you guys were first out of the gate, you've got about half a million users. But there are other competitors coming on -- ATT, Verizon, Sony obviously, maybe the cable players. How confident are you, you can defend the Sling business? And do you have any exclusives or anything that helps you keep an advantage?","Roger Lynch","We've always expected that the OTT business is going to be a competitive business and ultimately we may have competitors that aren't traditional pay-TV companies in the market. In many ways they'll be lower carriers to entry. You don't have to go build a cable system, you don't have to launch satellites and therefore we'll probably end up with more competitors. The nature of this industry is that there is not a lot of exclusive content. The channels business, the vast majority of the channels in the U.S. are licensed on a non-exclusive basis. So, I don't think it's going to be exclusive content that's going to drive the differentiation.","I think anyone who is going to succeed in OTT is going to have to be able to move very fast to be able to continue to innovate quickly and build their brand and grow their business and try to get scale that will bring them some other benefits in programming costs but also in the advertising side. As Charlie mentioned earlier, we think that the advertising model in OTT is in many ways superior to what it is in a traditional linear business because every ad can be targeted and we have lots more data that can be used for that targeting and therefore there's more value, both for our programming partners and for us in the advertising model.","Scott Moritz","You glossed right over the half a million subscribers. Did you want to clarify that in any way?","Charlie Ergen","Another good try.","Tom Cullen","Thank you, all.","Charlie Ergen","Thanks, everybody. We'll see you in three months.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jason Kiser. Please go ahead, sir.","Jason Kiser","Great. Thank you, Ashley. Thanks for joining us, everybody. I'm joined today by Charlie Ergen, our Chairman; Tom Cullen, EVP of Corporate Development; Erik Carlson, our CEO; Brian Neylon, President of DISH; Warren Schlichting, President of Sling; Paul Orban, our CFO; John Swieringa, our COO; and Tim Messner, our General Counsel. And for the first time, we're going to be having Marc Rouanne, our Chief Network Officer for wireless, and Stephen Bye, our Chief Commercial Offer for wireless join us.","So, I'll turn it over to Tim to do Safe Harbor, and then Erik and Paul have some prepared remarks to get to.","Timothy Messner ","All right.

We assume no responsibility for updating forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to the risks, uncertainties, and other factors discussed in our SEC filings. As part of the process for Auction 103, we filed an application to potentially participate as a bidder. Because of the FCC's anti-collision rules, we're not able to discuss what if any spectrum resources we bid on, and we won't be answering any questions on that auction in today's call.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Erik Carlson, our CEO.","Erik Carlson ","Thank you, Tim, and welcome, everyone. Well, as always, never a dull moment here, and of course, the big development with federal judge Victor Marrero's decision last week in favor of the T-Mobile merger, which for us is a key step forward as we look to acquire Boost Mobile from Sprint and activate the MVNO agreement with T-Mobile.","As I expect most of you know, there remain a few hurdles between here and deal certainty. Notably California PUC approval and a fulfillment [indiscernible] requirement. But we're taking appropriate measures, assuming the deal closes, and have teams working to ensure a smooth onboarding of the Boost business, including its dedicated employees and retail partners, and a seamless transition for servicing the Boost customers. Since our wireless announcement last July, we've had team members from all over the business really kick into overdrive and stay, to prepare for our entry into the retail wireless state and to stay on top of the day-to-day business. And I want to thank the entire team for their extra effort and focus. I'm confident that our preparations will serve us well as we move toward close and continue our build-out efforts.","As ever, our goal is to defer competition and promote America's leadership in 5G. Charlie and Tom are here to address not just our entry into the retail wireless, the progress of our 5G broadband network. A few brief observations on the quarter before I turn it over to Paul. First on the DISH TV side, we remain dedicated to pursuing the right customer in the right geography and delivering on the service, technology, and value. It's a strategy that has been yielding results for us over the longer term, and I'm pleased with the direction of our overall acquisition trends and the stability of the subscriber base. In the quarter, we saw 100,000 net subscriber loss for DISH. Looking back to the year-ago period, we lost 334,000 net subscribers. And look, it's not quite an apples-to-apples comparison. We were facing a different set of program challenges last year than we are now. That said, I do believe that we review our continued focus from Bryan's team and operational discipline with regard to acquisition and retention. So in addition to our right customer right geography philosophy, I think you can credit our continued investment in the Hopper platform to the relative stability of our user base.","We have two examples in the quarter. We announced integrations at Amazon Prime, as in our app on the Hopper, and Google Nest Hello video doorbell app through the Hopper platform. These kinds of improvements really underscore the value that we work every day to deliver across the business for DISH TV. On the Sling TV side of the house, we continued to disposition the pricing and delivery of overall value. While we saw an annual net sub growth, Sling did lose 94,000 customers in the quarter compared to a net gain of 47,000 in the fourth quarter last year. A few points on this to consider.","Obviously, this ecosystem is changing quite a bit. There is the dynamic of the broader OTT market change late last year with the wind down of Sony View and the introduction of additional streaming providers that launched with the aggressive commercial offers. Our goal is slated to draw tight focus on user experience and so overall value in its place in the streaming ecosystem which forms the excellent stand-alone solution for many. And our focus on best of live makes it really a perfect complement for the growing crowd of SVOD players. Recognize that we have the lead in customer experience.","We're dedicated to offering flexibility at the best price point. And you can see that with some of the added features and functionality we brought the service in the fourth quarter, including expanded live news offerings that included the launch of Fox News and the Sling Blue; free cloud DVR that provides a consistent experience for all TV subscribers, including subs in both Blue and Orange services, and updated channel line-ups in both the Blue and the Orange services. We see Sling well positioned to perform in the dynamic marketplace, but we also need to execute.","So before we get to Q&A, I'd like to turn it over to Paul Orban, our CFO, for a few brief remarks about the financials for the quarter.","Paul Orban ","Thank you, Erik. Our fourth quarter of DISH gross adds are up roughly 40% year-over-year, and we continue to activate high-quality drivers. However, Sling lost subscribers for the first time ever due to increased competition in disconnects related to the football season ending. And looking at the P&L, our operating income and EBITDA for the quarter are both up compared to last year, primarily due to improved margins, lower satellite and transmission expenses, partially offset by higher SAC. Our revenue declined due to a lower subscriber base, which was partially offset by higher Pay-TV ARPU. The increase in Pay-TV ARPU was driven by DISH TV's Q1 2019 price increase and our continued focus on acquiring and retaining high quality subscribers. In addition, Sling benefited from increased advertising revenue.","Our subscriber margins for the quarter were positively impacted by our higher quality subscribers, and reduced costs related to channel and mobile, including regional sports. However, we continue to face long-term pressure from programmers who want higher and higher rates, even in the face of declining viewership. DISH TV SAC is up this quarter due to increased subscriber activations. However, the cost per activation decreased slightly to $850 from $861 year-over-year. We continue to supply a greater percentage of our new customers with Hopper receivers. This drives additional hardware and installation costs, but we believe offering our best equipment influences customer loyalty over the long term. It delivers a better user experience, which has improved our churn rate.","Satellite and transmission expense decreased in the fourth quarter versus last year, as a result of the satellites we acquired from EchoStar during Q3. As a reminder, these satellites are now capitalized on our balance sheet, and are being depreciated over their remaining useful lives. We no longer make cash payments to EchoStar for the use of these satellites, which positively impacts both EBITDA and free cash flow.","G&A expenses were up this quarter, as a result of cost to support our wireless initiatives and legal fees. Despite increases in wireless CapEx and SAC, this generated $1.18 billion in free cash flow in 2019. During the fourth quarter, we completed the rights offering, raising approximately $1 billion, and ended the fourth quarter with approximately $2.9 billion of cash and marketable securities. This gives us the ability to purchase Boost for $1.4 billion, redeem the $1.1 billion debt maturity in May, and fund our wireless initiatives for 2020 with cash on hand. Our 2020 wireless expenditures are currently expected to be between $250 million and $500 million. As we've said before, we will be opportunistic in accessing the capital markets.","Finally, I echo Erik in saying how excited we are to begin serving Boost customers. In the last few months, we've been working with the Boost team, preparing for the close, and look forward to them joining the DISH family.","With that, I will turn it over for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin our first Q&A session. This Q&A session is for members of the analyst community. We will now take our first question from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse. ","Doug Mitchelson","Thanks so much. Charlie, there's been a lot of interest as to whether you should announce at some point soon an anchor tenant or a founding partner for your 5G wireless network build out, in particular, discussions with the likes of Amazon or other tech platform. Is there any context on the topic you're willing to share with investors at this point. It might be helpful to understand just your thinking on timeframes, whether it's, whether it's for anchor tenants or raising finance and it seems like you have a lot of flexibility now and all this assumes a T-Mobile\/Sprint closure. Any thoughts on that would be helpful. And I've got a couple of quick follow-ups on the Pay-TV business. Thank you.","Charlie Ergen","First, on Sprint and T-Mobile closing, so at this point, we're highly confident of that. Nothing has really changed in terms of what our strategy is. We look at strategic partnerships in a number of great ways, and not all those are financial, but certainly, we're, the infrastructure's good, so we don't have to build it, and we can partner somebody who has got infrastructure things in place. We'd rather do that if wants to, comes and strikes up and it makes sense for all parties, then obviously it would be very good to build out some of those things ourselves. And in terms of anybody that we look at strategically, the first step is that they've got to be aligned on our view, on our vision of where wireless can go, and we have a pretty solid view of where we think wireless can go.","It's materially different in terms of architecture of where networks are today. And it's very similar to when we started the digital satellite. We launched our own satellite. Went 100% digital. The world at that point what was predominantly analog, and our cable initially was analog. It was 1995. It was 2009 before the broadcasters went digital. The same kind of thing taking place today. And again, I just think that it's, our company's, it's not the first time we started working on wireless, and we've been at it for a long period of time, and we've put in a lot of building blocks in place for it, and we know we have a different way to the build the network with a lot less expenses to build a network, a lot less expensive to operate the network. We have less people because of automation and the fact that we can, our network is primarily going to be software and in the cloud, versus people's hardware networks today. The fact that we can embrace open standards. It's just a different model. So as you put those things together, obviously we'll share some of those things with industry but today's focus, let Tom talked about today's focus is. The short answer is you're not going to get a lot of information on particular partnerships and all that during the call which you guys always want, but you'll know whenever its best for you to know.","Timothy Messner","Yes, Doug. It's Tom. Obviously, in the summer when we announced the transaction, there was an increase in interest from prospective partners. And then that is ramped further with the judge's order last week. It's probably a shorter list of who we're not talking to, but we don't feel any particular urgency around striking a strategic partnership at this point. Our focus, as Erik said, is prepare to integrate the Boost business so we're operational day one. The second focus is to finalize the architecture of the network, which Marc and Stephen have been working on for several months, and we're encouraged by the progress. Third area of focus is to, we have integration work occurring right now in multiple labs around the country with various sets of vendors, and so the third area will be to narrow that down and move into contract finalization with key vendors. And then the fourth area is to plan deployments. We want to start deploying later in 2020. We're very cognizant of the FCC obligations that we've made, and we actually look forward to beating them because once we unleash nearly 100 megahertz of spectrum on a market by market basis, we're going to enjoy owner economics where our cost per gig will be so much lower than both the MVNO and the incumbents that will be incented to price aggressively and compete aggressively.","Doug Mitchelson","Helpful. Very helpful, thank you. A quick question on Sling. Looking at the fourth quarter, should we be extrapolating full-year results as we look forward for Sling? Or does the fourth quarter suggest any kind of change in strategy or growth impediments that we should be considering?","Warren Schlichting","This is Warren, by the way. I think there were a lot of different influences in last half of 2019. So, I think extrapolating might be dangerous. We had a price increase. We shifted our channel lineup so that it doesn't include RSNs anymore. So, we like our position. We like our team bundle. We may not be everything to everybody, but we like where we are, and we're taking a disciplined approach.","Doug Mitchelson","Thank you, all.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Michael Rollins, Citi. ","Michael Rollins","Couple of questions. First, I was wondering if you could expand a bit more on the cloud native solution for the wireless business, how that differentiates the cost, and how that might differentiate the customer experience. And then also, during your testimony, I guess it's a redacted transcript. The parts that were not redacted referred to the business model embracing bundling, and I was wondering if you could expand upon what are the types of bundles that you could foresee for the wireless business. Thanks.","Marc Rouanne","Yes, on the first question, this is Marc Rouanne on the architecture. So the cloud native, first of all, we have been testing and looking at the cloud and all the software that we are going to use each cloud native. Cloud native means you can put it in the cloud or you can put it on premise, or where you want. If you scale automatically, it will be adapted to the different usage. Now, why is there a difference for the end user? Actually, when you're cloud native, within seconds, you can adapt to a new server, right? Because you can move the software, you can adapt it, you then configure it. And a good way to think of it is the catalog of services you see on AWS or Azure. They do that for the data centers. We will have the same type of native software catalog of services that you can stitch together and apply to any use case, right? So the capability to differentiate is very big. The other thing is that of course the costs are different because now you're in data centers, you are on the all-purpose hardware, you are using the open source stacks. So, that's what makes the difference. A GDP speed and adapting to and the use case.","Charlie Ergen","And this is Charlie. I can't remember the question. The question was something about bundling and, bundling what?","Erik Carlson","Bundling around your testimony.","Charlie Ergen","Bundling around testimony, right. And look, I think, I'm not sure exactly, I don't remember exactly all my testimony, but from a bundling perspective, we have a chance to have more customer relationships than we do today. Obviously, we move out of more rural centric business to a more urban business. And so, a variety, obviously, video is a big part of what we do. But we also have in-home services. We also are able to connect people in a different way. So, there's a number of things we'll be able to do. I mean, the big picture is, I think DISH is on a growth, is now, we've put a lot of investment in the last few years to put ourselves in position that has linear TV declines. We had another engine to grow the business, and we're now in that situation. So it's very similar to, again, it's very similar to when we were doing the big DISH business and the analog business, and we saw that business declining four, five years before anybody else, and we were prepared with digital broadcasting when the time came, and we were able to grow our business exponentially over where it had been before. And I think we're in a similar situation where we are now. We're able to grow our business in the wireless side of it, but it was including growth in video, because a lot of the traffic that will go across our network, in fact the majority of the traffic across our network, will probably be video.","Operator","We will now take our next question from John Hodulik of UBS. ","John Hodulik","First of all, is there any more detail you can give us on your go-to-market strategy in either the prepaid market or postpaid markets in terms of pricing distribution? When we should expect to see you guys to enter those markets. And then as part of the deal, you have access to 20,000 towers and a bunch of retail locations for Sprint. I was wondering if you've done much due diligence on those sites, and if it's a big benefit for you, and do you expect to be utilizing any of these assets going forward? Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","We're not ready to disclose our go-to-market strategy. Obviously why, we're not very smart, but we're not that stupid to disclose that. Obviously, the towers in the stores or potentially positive, particularly the towers in the sense that it frees up, T-Mobile is not allowed to squat on the towers, and obviously towers are a big part of things that we're going to need. And so they are required to give us notice when they're going to vacate a tower. That probably helps on the margin on our build-out, and perhaps reduces some of our costs.","John Swieringa","The decommissioning of Sprint site will likely make available RAD centers that are at attractive heights to us. So, there is a rolling forecast that they could provide to us as to when they intend to vacate a tower.","Erik Carlson","I think that the big picture is that because we have used the T-Mobile network for seven years, along with some of the towers and so forth, we have a pretty big safety net. It gives Marc and Stephen a little bit more leeway in terms of how we build our network, we can take a few more chances, we can experiment a little bit, we can use some providers that maybe aren't household names that have done great things in the lab, or great things in other parts of the world, but really haven't been factors, are household names in the United States. It gives us a lot of, they'll do that, one of the things that maybe Marc wants to talk about. We have made to determined architecture that we will be an ORAN compatible network with the 7:2 split. So that is a, that's something that some of the big guys don't do. None of the incumbents do it in the United States today. But that is without question the way a modern network should be architected. And once you architect it that way, it opens up a whole different set of range of options, which are important to this country, right? When you start looking at some of the security concerns of this country with the Chinese vendors and things like that, there is no, the way to compete is to build a better network, not to build the same network using old technology. I don't know if you want to comment on that a little bit, Marc.","Marc Rouanne","Yes, so we've been working on ORAN for the last few months, and now we see that they're getting ready for us, and actually for other operators as well. That's the big trend in the industry. Everybody is working toward ORAN. You may wonder what is ORAN. It's very simple. You put something on top of the map, that's your radio. And then you can do whatever you want on the rest of the network. It will never impact again your radio. So, you can choose the vendors, but you can also have long-term sustainability of your radio deployments. Whereas today, if you touch the radio, you touch the tower of the site, you touch the network, and that's why it's so lengthy to bring new stuff in the existing networks. We won't have that problem; once we put the radio there, we do one climb, and we can upgrade, and we can change the software as fast as we want.","John Hodulik","Great, thanks. Very helpful. One last question. Any progress, Charlie, on the negotiations with T-Mobile about leasing them the 600 megahertz, and is that a potential source of cash flow growth?","Charlie Ergen","No, we have no current update on that.","Erik Carlson","No, we can't provide it.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Walter Piecyk of LightShed. ","Rich Greenfield","It's Rich Greenfield for Walt. He wanted me to ask a couple of wireless questions, and then I got a media question. Lead first on wireless. Charlie, you had said you'd be opportunistic in accessing the capital markets. I think if we go back to your core testimony, you were asked about a $1 billion loan from SoftBank, which would provide working capital because they can issue at a lower rate. Is that still available to you?","Charlie Ergen","SoftBank has made a commitment to us to assist in a small part of the financing of up to $1 billion. And so, yes, that is available to us. The net effect of that is it just, it would reduce our interest cost lower than it otherwise would be. It's not a $1 billion of capital for us. We still got to pay it back, but it does reduce our, would reduce our interest expense.","Rich Greenfield","Then on the media side of the house, your satellite sub losses seemed pretty minimal, given the amount of programing in terms of regional sports networks that you dropped that we continue to calculate your saving over $400 million a year on not having those RSNs. You've lost at most $30 million to $40 million, it looks like of EBITDA, from the sub losses the last couple of quarters. Is there any reason to think that this wasn't a great decision? I mean, it just keeps looking more and more like not in the RSN business, unless they're on a tier. But a lot of flexibility of how you tier them going forward without minimums. Is there any other way to look at this, and does Retrans with Sinclair ultimately change this? And then just the last question, kind of a big picture. As you think about DTV and DISH, it seems like they're in increased trouble on the DIRECTV side. Any thoughts you could share given the government's I guess, amenability to large-scale transactions? Does this make you rethink about DISH and DIRECTV at some point?","Charlie Ergen","We'll start with DISH DIRECTV. Probably inevitable that those two should go together just because the growth in TV is not coming from linear satellite TV providers. It's coming from huge programmers, and trillion-dollar companies. So, I think the regulatory environment, usually it's behind the marketplace, but I think that becomes increasingly likely that that makes logical sense. Having said that, obviously there still could be regulatory issues there. And we'll have to see how that all develops, but that's to me seems, and maybe each company only has two subscribers when you put them together, but eventually those two are probably going to, that's going to make some sense because you just can't, you can't swim upstream against a real tide of the over-the-top, big players. I forgot what the first question was. Oh, some regional sports.","Look, everything we do here is somewhat mathematical in the sense that we have real data for a long time of what our customers watch. And I don't think it takes real rocket science to see when customers watch and how much they watch, what the value of programming is. And the marketplace has been historical, and somebody got a price, and so their typical negotiating tactic is well, we were getting paid X. We now want X plus for the next contract. And it's always X plus, and that can be, as you've seen in the marketplace, that can be in the high single-digits in terms of price increases that people want. What we see is the exact opposite, which is people are watching less of many people's programmers, and we would say that your price should go down if people are watching less. And one of the big outliers was regional sports in terms of the amount of money they charge and collect versus the amount of people who actually view them. So, we would love to do a deal with regional sports.","We really like Sinclair the company. We would, it was unfortunate circumstance in that Sinclair did not own the regional sports on our contract was up. And then once somebody leaves our network that wants regional sports, it doesn't make sense to burden the, because we have less people today on our network, we still have some people that might want to watch regional sports. But it's a fraction of what it was last August when they came down. So, the programmers have a hard time understanding that once somebody leaves their network, there's no reason to put something back and tax the rest of people because the people who really watch the channel leave us because they have alternatives. So, the math was clear that the kind of offer we had from the Disney folks at the time that our contract was up was not even close to something that made sense for us.","A lot of times in business, it's really easy decisions, and some you got to think about. But this was an easy one, and that's where we are today. And obviously, Sinclair now owns it. We've had a great relationship with Sinclair for a long period of time. But whether you can put Humpty Dumpty back together again remains an open question.","Rich Greenfield","It seems like the math on that would be very hard.","Charlie Ergen","The math actually isn't that hard. It's just that the math is different for us now because we have less, right? And they have other customers and other contracts. And so, they get, but the math is easy. We know what it's worth, and it's worth less today than it was last year.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Philip Cusick of JP Morgan. ","Philip Cusick","I guess starting Mark and Steven have come on since the last call and Mark started with us around architecture already, but can you or they expand on any other evolutions to the network strategy since they came on-board?","Marc Rouanne","Yes. We've talked about ORAN. I think this is known now, we have talked about cloud native. Actually another very important thing is automation. The way we are in the labs today and the way we test, we're not testing fancy or 3GPP features. We're testing automation from ground up. We have a big green deal automation where we have virtualized network where everything is happening by the milliseconds or the second. We've what is called closed loop automation. So for example, you lose a site the rest of the sites are coping for that site automatically and it's across the board. If you want to slice you have to have a network that is automated and that's a big differentiator in the future for us compared to existing networks that are not automated. If you want to create a slice in an existing 4G network or new 5G add-on, it's done manually, you provision, your script. We want the network to do it dynamically. That's the next big thing and we have had the good traction in automation to be honest, much better than we expected.","Another one is that, we think consumption. We are not building a network and then thinking how do we sell it? Actually we're starting from older use cases that have been studied for the last three to five years when 5G was defined and we are looking, how would we consume the network based on those healthcare, smart TVs, transport use cases and how do we automate the prices based on that? So it's a consumption driven architecture. Again we see a lot of traction in the U.S. ecosystem because a lot of people have been doing that for new services. Use cases that everybody knows like the Airbnb, Uber. We just use the same techniques. So that's what has changed. The last thing is on the open source. Everybody knows about, has heard the Kubernetes containers. These are a bit technical but what is interesting is that we can leverage the U.S. ecosystem around open source. A lot of the things that the Nokia, Ericsson had to build themselves is now completely available to us. More recently a lot of work has started on the hardware side rounded up from security.","When we talk to the enterprises, what do they want? They want to manage their network themselves but they also want to manage their security. And we see ways in the U.S. native ecosystem to have these grounded up security, all the way from the hardware and all the way into the software. So that's another big thing that will differentiate us. Security will be native.","Philip Cusick","Thank you. Then Charlie, I was just going to say, leaving the current auction aside, obviously, do you see a need to buy more mid-band as CBRS and C-band come available in the next year?","Charlie Ergen","Yeah. We have normally participated I think every auction. We started with the third auction that was ever held. 25 years ago we typically, we've always participated. We usually don't land much if anything. I don't see that changing. The only other thing I was going to add on Mark. Mark was talking a lot about the enterprise business, which is a different use case of our network. It's a big part of what networks can do that's beyond just the consumer. So I think that what Mark is architecting is a network that the consumer will be a big slice of that network and that's what Boost and everything that Boost does in the future, particularly in postpaid will be a big slice to that network but part of that network also can be used by the enterprise customers in a way that current networks really can't accommodate. And so that's another opening. That's not probably in anybody's model today. In terms of how we use it and how we'll generate revenue from the network but certainly the network is designed to be able to accommodate that. I get that typically. Almost every Fortune 500 directors is asking their management what is their 5G strategy. Part of that strategy, if they were-- I mentioned would be potentially the kind of thing we're building. So I just think we're a different animal.","I'll tell you one more thing; a lot of analysts get confused with incumbent networks and the cost of building those networks in the past and the cost of maintaining those networks, the OpEx that you have on networks. Some big companies today spend as much money in a year or two just to maintain their networks as we'll spend to build the network. The reason is the legacy is so hard and so complex and not automated, so you need a lot of people to do it and you have 2G, 3G and 4G that you have to maintain while you're yet to be backward compatible with everything. But the cost of that is just astronomical compared to more modern network where you see in the IT world you don't have thousands of people in the data center anymore. You probably can count. In a big data center today you probably count on one hand the number of employees there. In a modern architecture work with automation, we just need a lot less people to run the network and you're starting to see that. With that clean sheet of paper and you have automation you can do that. So our cost of material is less.","Philip Cusick","One quick follow-up for Paul if I can. Can you give us an idea of what the incoming Boost EBITDA run rate is going to look like?","Paul Orban","Well, we don't really disclose that. We can probably take a look at what platform does and what they do from a subscriber perspective to get an idea of what it may look like.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays. ","Kannan Venkateshwar","Charlie, just from a business model perspective, when you look at wireless longer term, when you think about all the alternatives available you laid out enterprise right now and there is also the possibility of going wholesale and licensing capacity to third-parties and then there is, of course, the retail business, how do you see the mix evolving in the end state? Do you think retail will be as big a part of your business as it is for the traditional telcos or will that be a much smaller fraction of your overall wireless business, potentially in the end state? Secondly, from a capital perspective, as you go through the process of raising more capital to fund the build-out, do you have any thoughts on capital structure? Would there be a big equity component as you go down this path of raising capital? If you could help us with that that would be very useful. Thanks.","Charlie Ergen","Obviously, we're starting to very, on the retail side of the business, we're starting at a very low base with approximately 9 million Boost customers. So obviously, versus the 100 plus million that the other 3 incumbents will have. So we're going to be very low base there. Having said that, we think that that's a, there is some opportunity in that marketplace and one size doesn't fit all and with the lower cost structure and flexibility in how we do it, we think there's things we can do to grow that business. But obviously, we're not going to be-- obviously, we're going to be very, very different for a long period of time there.","In terms of capital structure, obviously one could certainly foresee that our capital structure could be a blend of equity and debt, depending on where the marketplaces are, and depending on how comfortable we are the business. We don't have all the answers to everything we're going to do, but we have 39 years of experience and a management team that knows how to deal with uncertainty and knows how to take advantage of opportunities that the marketplace presents. And we're going to go where we can be profitable and where we have strengths, and maybe our opponents have some weaknesses, and we, I mean, we're really good at that. I mean, that's a core, basic skill this company has, to be able to find opportunities and be creative, and we haven't lost that. We've only enhanced that over the years.","So, it's never a, every company has challenges. Every company doesn't have a perfect crystal ball, but this company is really, really good at dealing with uncertainty, and opportunity, and taking advantage of it.","Operator","We will now take our next question from David Barden of Bank of America. ","David Barden","Charlie, maybe a little bit of follow-up on that prior question. It came up at the trial that absent a partner, that there were several large banks that would be willing to maybe step up and help finance the project. What would that look like in terms of collateral? Would that kind of be collateralized by the spectrum side of things, even though the FCC has a build-out related foreclosure right? Or where would it have to sit in the organization, if you were to go to the bank to help fund this? And then a follow-up question would be, if and when you do go to the financial industry to try and get this financing, kind of we only have really one number in the business plan today, which is $10 billion to build a network. Is there any other kind of number, or framework, or cumulative amount of operating capital losses, target market shares, anything that you could kind of give so that the street can kind of think about what this business model really might look like? Thanks so much.","Charlie Ergen","Yes. I mean, I think obviously there are, we wouldn't expect to be raising capital without some kind of detail, in the $10 billion range without some kind of details about where that all goes and so forth. So obviously, we'd do that. But again, the business plan is going to be an extraordinary business plan for the future for those people who think long term, and obviously, there are still a few long-term investors left. Not many, but a few. And this is, certainly, to raise that kind of capital, you'll have more meat on the bone in terms of the numbers. But the model will probably look better than most people have speculated, and the costs are probably materially less than many people have speculated. It's just a big paradigm shift. It's really the --again, going from analog to digital was the one that we capitalized a long time ago, and this one is every bit as big or bigger in terms of virtualizing the network against where legacy companies have a really, really hard time to get there in the short run. They'll get there certainly in the long run, but they have a tough time in the short run to do that.","David Barden","Charlie, just as a follow-up, you pointed us to maybe Tracfone as a template for maybe what the prepaid business that you're inheriting might look like. Would you point us to Rakuten and kind of look at their business plan, their capital investment timing, their kind of subscriber goals and such as kind of a template for what you think you can do here in the U.S.? Or are you doing something significantly different than what they're trying to do in Japan?","Charlie Ergen","With Tracfone, obviously, Tracfone's not a hugely profitable business. So, I wouldn't expect that Boost is a hugely profitable business but the part that could be, shouldn't be a huge problem because we have an NPL agreement for seven years with T-Mobile's better and better network as they build it out. We have an opportunity to grow that business, particularly since we have user economics coming on the back-end, and we can pull the price. I mean, owner economics that we can pull the price. So that's a pretty unique position to be in, and we'll probably have to go into more detail on the conference call of that, but that was unique position to be in.","And then, Rakuten is important in the sense that we've learned a lot from them, but they're really the first company to start embracing kind of an ORAN open architecture system, and it's been pretty incredible the amount of progress they made in 18 months since we first announced what they were going to do. But their actual start, I think their turn on sometime in the next few months, it's not two months away, but we learned a lot from them. There's a few things that we're going to do differently. The market's been, the technology has advanced, so we get the advantage of 18 more months of technology with advancements since they had to make some of their decisions. Some of our decisions might be the same as they're making, but it gives us a really good template to say what did they do right. Where does the marketplace advance from where they started working on, and how we use those things to our advantage?","And so, it's always a little easier to be the second person, not the first person. They're going to get a lot more arrows in the back than hopefully we will. But I expect they'll be very successful in what they're doing and they certainly are designing the right kind of network for the future. But it's 4G and so the big thing we get to do is start with 5G. And we started a lot more spectrum than they do too.","Erik Carlson","And while there are similarities, clearly, the two markets are vastly different.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. ","Craig Moffett","Could you guys comment on the timing of capital investments? It looks like you lowered your CapEx a little bit for your guidance for this year. I expect some of that may just be the timing of when the deal is closing. But now that you've got some clarity about the length of the runway for build-out requirements in the end of the T-Mobile wholesale agreement, how do you think about when you want to make your network best and start making the larger capital investments to get your network built?","Erik Carlson","So, you're right. We didn't really lower it. I mean, I think we'd always talked about $1 billion in [indiscernible] and then into 2020. What were you going to say, Paul?","Paul Orban","I was going to say that the original disclosure was $500 million to $1 billion, and that included all spend in '19 and in '20. We just modified it to $250 million to $500 million for 2020. So if you take into consideration what we spent in 2019, we're within that range there.","Erik Carlson","But the big thing, Craig, is that we have a lot of flexibility. So on your timing question, it will be a lot; the first thing we're doing is our planning and making sure we get our towers in the permitting, that's kind of a long-haul intent. And so there's not a lot to build this year because we started, we've got to get those permits in zoning, and structural, and all the things, all the civil works that you need to do. And so, we have the flexibility to do that. The second thing is that from a hardware perspective and a software perspective, some of the things that we're doing is, they're in production, but they're not off the shelf today, so we have to wait for those things. But with the T-Mobile MVNO deal, we get a lot of flexibility in terms of timing that we do that. The only flexibility we don't have obviously in 2022. We've got to be in 20%, for our FCC commitment, we've got to cover 20% of the population. So, we could, we'll certainly have all our zoning and permitting done for far greater than that, and then we'll build accordingly, depending on what were the, what the state of hardware, software is. So again, the good news is we have a pretty big safety net today, and we can now make mistakes and still survive some of our mistakes. We're certainly working with the net. Sometimes in our company, we haven't worked with that, we haven't had a net to work with. So I'm sleeping a little bit better. We got up on a Chinese rocket. There's not much of a ne. And today, we've got seven years of a pretty good net. I don't see big risk there today. But obviously, we've got to go execute, and we're not going to convince anybody until we, until you see our first market, and you can touch it and feel it, and see why it's different. And that --we'll get down within that, hopefully by end of the year, but certainly over the next year, we'll get that done.","Craig Moffett","But am I right? It sounds like, reading between the lines of your answer, that barring the 2020 senior commitments for the build out at the FCC, that your interests are, it makes more sense to back-end load the capital investment, if you can. Is that a fair interpretation of what you just said?","Erik Carlson","Every month that goes by, our costs go down, and the technology is a little bit better. So, when you have a paradigm shift in technology, it becomes a sweet spot of how you exercise your decisions in terms of your capital expenditure. We don't know enough to know exactly where that sweet spot is. My gut feel is we're going to need to release 16 at 3GPP. That's supposed to be out in June. That might slip because of the virus and all that, so that could slip a little bit, and then if you've got to get in the equipment. So, as soon as release 16 is readily available in the equipment and software, then that's probably the sweet spot for us. And is that this time next year? Probably, and then we go pretty quick. And so, I think what you're going to see is the CapEx being a pretty steady run rate sometime next year, but it's not very big this year.","Paul Orban","And Craig, as you know, we have other commitments beyond 2022. So it's pretty, there's a cadence to the build-out both in '23 and then there's additional build-outs in '25 and '26.","Erik Carlson","But the big difference is that we will build, we will focus a lot more on city by city. So, there's obviously going to be some cities that are more interested in getting 5G quickly. And those cities that want to work with us will probably get first priority, and then obviously when we build out a city, we can have owner economics there, so we don't have to build, we're probably not going to build two towers in every city. We'll build out city by city and complete a city before we move to the next city. Obviously, we can build multiple cities at the same time, but that's a bit of a strategy that we'll have.","Jason Kiser ","Operator, we have time for one more from the analyst community before we move to media.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our final question from the analyst community.","[Operator Instructions]","We will begin the media portion of this call following the answer to the final analyst question. Our final analyst question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. ","Brett Feldman","There's two, if you don't mind. First one is pretty simple. What's your latest thoughts on how quickly you'll be able to close on the Boost transaction? And then second, Charlie, you talk about the opportunity to sell your network capabilities into enterprises. It seems like one of the keys to selling the enterprises distribution. All these big customers have an AT&T rep calling on them. They have a Verizon rep calling on them. They might even have a Sprint rep calling on them. How do you intend to access those types of decision makers, and is that a natural example of where partnerships could be an important part of your strategy going forward? Thank you.","Charlie Ergen","Yes, Brett, on closing the Boost, we're not required to close until we can provision any new Boost customer on the T-Mo network. I think this public, technically? How many days that is after the [indiscernible]? Anyway, that should be some, it won't be simultaneously with Boost, I mean with the T-Mo, Sprint merging because then they have to, once they're merged, they'll take a bit of time to make it where we can provision. But they are under a strict timeline for the consent decree, and it's not a lot of time before we close on that. I think that might be public, but I don't want to say it if it's not. And then on enterprise businesses, we would follow the normal philosophy we have that if there exists, as an example, an enterprise sales force that we don't have to recreate, and we can do something with that sales force, then we would do that. If nobody that has an enterprise sales force wants to be with us, we'll build it, and we're prepared to go either way. But our first choice would be to work with somebody who already has enterprise sales force in place. And the good news is that when our competition comes into sell enterprise business, we'll have a better product. So, it doesn't mean we'll get all the business. But I mean, we'll get our fair share.","Operator","We will now take questions from members of the media.","[Operator Instructions] Our first media question comes from Scott Moritz of Bloomberg. ","Scott Moritz","Charlie, as you look ahead to the closure of the Sprint T-Mo deal and your entry into the wireless marketplace, what phones are you going to be able to sell? Have you talked to the two top phone makers where you'd be able to have the latest iPhone and Samsung phones?","John Swieringa","Hi, it's John Swieringa. I'll take that one. Obviously, since we announced the deal back in July, we've been in close contact with all of the major OEMs. We've got the ability to go direct where it makes sense with them, as well as go through continuity agreements through the transition services agreements that we have. And obviously, there's new line-ups coming out in 2020 with features and things like that. We're right in the middle of all those discussions, and we'll be in a position to be competitive at the price level.","Charlie Ergen","So Scott, bottom line, we will have phones. That's not a risk to our business.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back to our speakers.","Erik Carlson","Okay. Thank you, operator. I appreciate everybody joining, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the call. Thank you for your participation.

And I believe both Joe and Robert has some prepared remarks they'd like to go through before we open up the lines for questions.","Joseph P. Clayton","Thanks, Jason, and good morning. Now when I last spoke to you all back in November, I discussed the steps that we had taken to refocus our business. I also told you all that we expected to see improved financial and sales performance in the fourth quarter. This momentum would springboard us into the New Year. Then we'd launch a host of new strategic initiatives to enhance our ongoing transformation. Well,  I'm pleased to report that the fourth quarter was indeed a positive quarter for DISH, both commercially and financially. And today, I'm also going to briefly discuss our exciting new product and marketing programs that we announced last month at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show. ","But first let me provide you all with an update on our DBSD and TerreStar spectrum assets. As you are aware, we've been working with the FCC to gain approval on our transfer and waiver rights request so that we can proceed in closing both transaction. We anticipate receiving a response from the FCC in the coming weeks. Until then, we cannot comment on our specific plans. But I will say that we're anxious to move beyond the regulatory phase. And we want to optimize these wireless assets in order to drive our compelling customer offering. This is the way the American consumer is going, wireless video, wireless voice and wireless broadband. A little later, Charlie can also speak to these assets if the question arises. ","Now let's spend a minute updating you all on our Blockbuster segment. For the third straight quarter, the overall business was breakeven. For the third quarter, the overall business came in very close to where we'd  expected. And we have been very clear from the beginning that we would take action when necessary. As a result, the first quarter, we will close roughly 500 domestic stores for a variety of reasons, such as underperformance, footprint size or lack of landlord flexibility. The vast majority of these stores have flexible termination provisions. Now our goal is to reach a steady-state store count so that we can leverage with our current pay-TV business and our future wireless enterprise similar to the way that we've incorporated Blockbuster @Homes,  by mail and streaming services into our pay-TV business. ","Now let's take a look at the current pay-TV market environment. When the economy changes, the consumer changes, technology changes and the competition changes, guess what, you better change. There's no question that  significant shifts are taking place in the pay-TV industry today. The market is most certainly approaching a saturation point. We will still experience single-digit growth as the economy rebounds and new home formations restart. And within this mature environment, there will be some growth segments, like the Hispanic market and the consumer B2B or business market. These are 2 of the categories that will receive a much greater business focus from us as we move into 2012. ","We've also spent the last 6 months retooling and reenergizing our core pay-TV business. This includes launching new products; new promotions; a new brand image, focused on variety, innovation and value; new corporate partnerships; new marketing communications, including a new website and new national advertising; and even new corporate mascots. Again, it is no secret that the pay-TV industry has been too focused on price. It is being driven today by aggressive new customer discounting at the risk of alienating existing customers. And our current products have had consumer-friendly names, like our own ViP 722k. ","Going forward, we want our DISH products to be perceived more like the mobile phone industry, with names like the RAZR, the iPhone and the Droid. So we've introduced new corporate kangaroo mascots, Hopper and Joey, to symbolize a new era for DISH. They give a personality and an attitude to the product itself. The revolutionary new Hopper is the satellite industry's smallest, energy-efficient and feature-laden HD whole-home DVR. Hopper's sidekick is the Joey, a tiny, lightweight and easy-to-hide companion for multiple-room viewing. Our Hopper HD DVR solution lets the customer watch TV shows and movies in up to 4 different rooms at the same time, record as many as 6 HD programs at once and it is equipped with the fastest and simplest user interface in the video industry today. And to further differentiate our new product and technical platform from our competitors, we will bring more music, more movies and more magic to the American public. ","First, in terms of music. Hopper will offer 73 channels of SIRIUS XM commercial-free music, including 9 new Latino stations. And because we are a visual company, the album cover of the appropriate song will also appear on the screen. Secondly, more movies. The Hopper also possesses a 2-terabyte  hard drive that stores up to 2,000 hours of sports and entertainment content, the industry's largest video library. And lastly, the magic. With just one click, the Hopper can automatically record every prime time show in high definition, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC for 8 consecutive days. We call this unique feature PrimeTime Anytime, and we are confident that it will capture the minds and imagination of the buying public. Now another bit of Hopper magic is its ability to offer on-demand content for customers with limited or no Internet access. We call this capability DISH Unplugged, and it delivers hundreds of the most popular movies and TV shows via satellite. More music, more movies and more magic, all product attributes that the cable industry and DirecTV cannot match. ","You know DISH has always had a history of technical innovation, but we were reluctant to tell anybody about it. That will change going forward with very focused promotional and advertising activities. The centerpiece of our first quarter marketing campaign will be our Blockbuster @Home promotion. This is basically our original Blockbuster Movie Pass announced last fall, but now enhanced with an additional 6,000 streamed family and kid shows. A large number of these titles address the Hispanic market, thanks to a new programming agreement with Univision. ","Our Sling-enabled TV Everywhere product is another DISH first. And this has been underpublicized. We've enhanced this capability to allow subscribers to watch DISH online content via tablets and other mobile devices. And to ensure that potential customers have the ability to sample our compelling content, we will introduce DISH Test Drive, which lets consumers view video on their tablet, PC or smartphone at no charge for 24 hours. And finally, our Hopper launch will be supported by a product-focused national advertising campaign beginning March 15. So as we used to say in the TV business, stay tuned. ","So we basically revamped our pay-TV and commercial direction. And going forward, we want to communicate to the American public an image that represents family, fun and wholesome entertainment. Now one last product announcement at CES was our new broadband satellite partnership with ViaSat. We've just started offering broadband satellite, bundled with our own DISH video services. This will make available download speeds of up to 12 megabits to millions of customers in rural America. ","Now let's move onto  the highlights of the fourth quarter. We gained 22,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, both from increased activations and improved churn. We ended 2011 with a total net loss for the year of 166,000 subscribers. But more importantly, we generated positive sales momentum in the back half of the year. An additional plus: churn came in at 1.54% for the fourth quarter and 1.63% for the full year. With our price freeze on core programming packages this year, the stage is also set for a good churn number in 2012. ","Originally or operationally, we continue to make improvements in customer service, installation and retention, plus we're making a significant investment in our information technology. For example, we expect to launch our new billing system in late March. In terms of financial performance, a net income increase year-over-year in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2011. Cash flow was also significantly higher year-over-year. And  Robert will give you more detail in a few minutes. ","Now looking forward into 2012, we'll focus on providing the best product and value in the industry. We will also accelerate our operational initiatives to increase our number of Internet-connected customers and to increase overall levels of customer satisfaction. As I previously stated, we had a strong year in terms of net income. In 2012, we'll not have the benefit of a price increase to offset higher programming costs. However, with our new product and marketing plans in place, we're striving to maintain our net income level. ","Now to give you some additional highlights into our fourth quarter financial results, here's our CFO, Robert Olson.","Robert E. Olson","Thank you. Well, as Joe described, our fourth quarter results were generally in line with expectations. While most metrics improved, we still have a lot of work ahead of us. We were pleased with our churn rate of 1.54% for the fourth quarter and 1.63% for the full year, which indicates our everyday value message is starting to resonate with our customers. Subscriber-related revenue grew by 3.4% in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased by 1.7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. ARPU was up 3.5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and increased by $0.31 relative to the third quarter. ","As discussed in our last call, pay-per-view revenue and ad sales revenue typically improves sequentially in the fourth quarter. Total company revenue increased by 13.3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and by 11.1% comparing the full year 2011 to 2010. The revenue increase was largely driven by the incorporation of Blockbuster into our results and our pay-TV price increase in early 2011. ","Subscriber-related expenses increased by 2.5% in 2011 versus 2010 and by 1% year-over-year in the  fourth quarter. We continue to work on driving down our variable cost through process improvements in operations. These variable cost reductions were offset by higher programming expenses. The programming expense increase was due to contractual rate increases and was consistent with the trends we have seen during the last few years. ","Total cost of sales increased year-over-year as 2010 did not include Blockbuster's results. As Joe mentioned, we are closing roughly 500 Blockbuster stores in the first quarter. We analyzed profitability at the store level and these stores were not able to reach acceptable levels of performance. We expect the shutdown costs associated with these store closures to be minimal. As we have discussed before, we were able to purchase the Blockbuster assets at a far lower price than their previous book value. As a result, we saw lower-than-historical levels of Blockbuster cost of sales in 2011. This impact will diminish over time as Blockbuster's inventory is replenished with new content. So we still have a lot of work ahead of us to improve the retail stores. ","Our focus is to keep the business near breakeven, while we test new marketing ideas, both integrated with the pay-TV business and standalone. Our SAC for the year was $771, a slight improvement versus 2010 due to a higher percentage of redeployed receivers, which was driven by an increased mix of MPEG-4 receivers in our installed base. SAC in the fourth quarter was $778, a significant improvement year-over-year as last year's number was distorted by the impact of programming rate disputes on our new activations level. ","Administrative expenses were also impacted by the Blockbuster acquisition. G&A expenses for the DISH pay-TV business were largely consistent with recent trends. Net income was up almost 54% for the full year and increased 24% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. This improvement was driven by the pay-TV price increase in February, lower activation levels and lower litigation accruals, partially offset by increased interest expense this year due to higher debt levels. ","Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was about 4 points lower than run rate, driven partly by a true-up on state tax rates based on our recent filings. Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 37% to 38% range, similar to our full year rate. We generated $398 million of free cash flow in the quarter and almost $1.8 billion for the year. Improved year-over-year net income less capital spending and favorable cash versus booked taxes due to bonus depreciation have all contributed to this performance. ","There were 2 major changes on the balance sheet versus last quarter. First, on October 3, we redeemed the remaining $915 million principal balance on our 6 3\/8% senior notes. Second, we paid out $893 million of cash on December 1 to support our $2 per share dividend. While we have largely funded DBSD and TerreStar, the timing of the deals closing depends on FCC approval. These acquisitions will be consolidated as of their closing dates. ","Let me now turn it back to Joe before we start Q&A.","Joseph P. Clayton","Thanks, Robert. A new year, a new DISH, new product, new promotions and new opportunities. After 8 months here at DISH, we're about where I expected us to be. In other words, we are on schedule in terms of our transformation plan. Plus we've just passed the 14 million subscriber mark. We have a solid plan in place and we are working hard every day to accomplish it. ","Phase 1 of our transformation plan is now complete. We have identified the areas for improvement. We have set specific objectives. And these include: increase net activations, lower churn, improve customer satisfaction, decrease customer contact rate, increase broadband connectivity, grow market share and improve ARPU. And lastly, we developed a detailed game plan or strategy. In fact, we've already prioritized and launched key improvement initiatives. ","And now Phase 2 begins. That is all about execution. As we move forward, we will fix the things that need further improvement, implement additional plans, and where required, modify the game plan accordingly. With hard work and improved economy and successful implementation of our plan, we should be hitting on all cylinders by year end. ","Thanks for listening and putting up with my cold today. Now we'll open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stefan Anninger from Credit Suisse.","Stefan Anninger - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you discuss your outlook for 2012 ARPU growth and what are the things you are doing to help boost that growth, given the lack of a price increase in 2012? And perhaps specifically, you could talk about the roll-off of the Starz promotion and how you've gone about trying to move those subs perhaps into a premium package and how that may be going.","Robert E. Olson","Yes, Stefan, this is Robert. We talked a little bit about this on our last call that we are very focused on sell-up opportunities. Premiums are an important focus for us. We've been working very hard on that. And I think that as the year progresses, we should see some slight improvement in ARPU as a result of that. We had some -- as I mentioned in my speaking notes, we had some favorable benefit in the fourth quarter as a result of normal seasonality. So I would not look for that improvement to be really material until the second quarter.","Stefan Anninger - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could I ask one just quick follow-up question? Could you comment just briefly on the VOOM litigation and the recent developments there and how you think about the financial risk associated with that litigation?","R. Stanton Dodge","Yes. And this is Stanton. We are obviously disappointed with the ruling from the appeals court. And as we disclosed in our K, we tend to -- or intend to and have filed briefing to actually appeal that to the next highest-level court. And we hope that they'll take that up on an interim basis. And if not, we'll certainly pursue that after the trial.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo.","Marci Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. Joe and Robert, you pointed out churn in the quarter, which was significantly better than expected. Can you give some color on what drove this? Is it Blockbuster? Is it better customer service? Is it anything specific? And then the second question, it looks like you're closing the gap in churn with DirecTV based on the fourth quarter. So turning to ARPU, do you think that over time the new products you're offering, the Hopper, et cetera, will allow you to close the gap in ARPU with DirecTV? And if so, how long do you think it will take for this to happen?","Joseph P. Clayton","Well, I think we're doing a much better job on retention. And it started about the time the SUNDAY TICKET got  rolled off back in the fall. And we fight \u2013 we work hard every day to work on our retention levels. And I'm very pleased with the direction of that it's been heading in. And we feel good about moving into 2012, where we won't take a price increase so that should give us a little bump. In terms of ARPU, I think we will narrow the gap as we sell a better mix of product hardware and a better mix of programming. How fast that gap will narrow and to what degree still remains to be seen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple  things. First, I just want to make sure I have this right. You said the goal was to strive to maintain net income levels in 2012 from 2011. Is that right?","Joseph P. Clayton","Yes.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So there's $1.5 billion of net income in 2011, so  the goal is to hit that.","Robert E. Olson","Doug, this is Robert. Let me clarify that. Obviously, we're not going to overcome the favorable litigation accrual reversal that occurred in 2011. And then second...","Joseph P. Clayton","How much was that?","Robert E. Olson","That was roughly  $300 million at the operating line, $200 million at the net. And then second, we're very focused on, as Joe mentioned in his speaking notes, about the pay-TV business maintaining roughly flat net income. We've made investments in the spectrum business. As we consolidate that business, we'll incur some depreciation and administrative expenses associated with that business. Once that business is -- once the approval for that business is obtained, we'll break that business line out separately.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. Great, that's helpful. I'm just not used to getting guidance from DISH, so it takes a little getting used to. On the DVR pricing, so I'm just curious, with the commitment to customers to not raise your programming prices, that still should leave you some flexibility to raise equipment prices, I would think. And your DVR pricing is low relative to a lot of your competitors. Is there any thoughts around the potential for raising equipment prices this year? Is that what helps you get to flattish net income for the base business?","Robert E. Olson","Doug, this is Robert again. Obviously, we're looking at all aspects of our business. We have no plans right now for an equipment price increase. However, we'll look at that throughout the year. We are fairly confident in our ability, as Joe mentioned, to sell up to higher packages and to more premiums.","Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then I guess, lastly, I'm not sure what you're willing to say on wireless spectrum. But there is some concern that it could take a while to get approvals. Just sort of given the nature of these particular waivers, sort of the unusual circumstances around the potential for windfall profits, is there any sort of thoughts around timing as a strategy around the wireless spectrum change at all since you first started pursuing and acquiring it?","Charles W. Ergen","Yes, this is Charlie. I mean, I guess, I'll start you with kind of a big -- I'll probably start you better with a big picture  look at that. One is we obviously,  the last 4 years, have been putting things in place to get in the wireless industry. And we think that's a key and even a transformative strategy for us. But we could only enter that business. I look at it and say, \"Do I have an 80% chance of success to be successful?\" And if so, you go in full-bore and give your best effort. So when we started DISH Network, we thought if we could just get past the Chinese -- the launch, get the satellite up, that we had an 80% chance of being successful. A lot of people didn't think it was that high, but that's kind of where we were. And so you always have that point. The hardest point of a new initiative is usually getting started, right? So for us in the satellite business, it really was that Chinese launch that had to be successful. We had 20 minutes of that launch. We had no control over it, the rocket's  either going to be successful or not. And if it's not successful, we probably wouldn't have been able to enter the business because the time to get another satellite built and another launch would have been too great. We're in a very similar situation to enter the wireless business, where I think we have an 80% chance or better of being very successful in that business today with the spectrum that we've accumulated and with the leapfrog in technology to LTE, which is a major leapfrog from where it is today, very similar to where MPEG-2 was a major leapfrog in analog video and DBS. But we essentially have exactly the same problem as a Chinese launch in that we're in front of the FCC for a much-needed waiver, which has been granted before to other companies, so it's not a new precedent.  In fact, waivers have  been granted in many, many different things because it just has -- it has to be in the public interest. So that waiver is a little bit like the Chinese rocket in the sense that the FCC really has their hand on the button, and they're either -- that waiver is either going to be granted or they'll push the destruct button for our business plan would be just like a Chinese launch failure. In other words, they could go to -- they could not rule on our waiver at all, which would be the effect of killing it or they could go to a rulemaking, which would be the effect of a long delay before we could do anything. And the reason that a delay is so important is that our chipsets and our infrastructure is at a different frequency that's not used in the United States today. And so our lead time to build those products and invest in those products, we had to start from scratch. So that's a major hurdle to overcome. And you really can't start that process until you kind of have -- you kind of know the rules of the game for you entering  the market. And so we need a waiver not to have to put a satellite link in our handsets. Otherwise, we wouldn't be competitive. So we're waiting to see if our launch is successful. We think that where it stands with the FCC today is that their self-imposed 180-day window from the time we filed our combined application is up on March 12. We would expect that what we've asked for is a decision on our waiver request and our merger request; we would hope that they will keep those 2 together and make a decision on those 2 things. The standard for our waiver again would be do we serve the public interest. And as opposed to maybe some people in the past, we have -- it's a fairly supportive rulemaking. We've gone through the full rulemaking process that maybe others haven't in the past. The comments, there's no material opposition even from our competitors to our getting granted the waiver. The GPS industry has come out in favor that we do --  not in favor, but the GPS industry has supported our initiative that we do not interfere in the GPS range with our frequencies, in fact,  very few interference issues. And we have a situation where there's 40 megahertz of spectrum that could be put into place. And every day that we go by is a delay in whoever uses that spectrum, it's a delay in that use of that spectrum, where we have obviously a spectrum crunch. And so we're just waiting to see whether we can get I the business. If, by chance, we were not granted a waiver or it was kicked down the road without a decision through rulemaking, then I think that we'll have to consider the risk. And at this point, I would say that we probably don't have a chance of success, an 80% chance of success in the business. And we'd have to look at other alternatives on what to do with the business in the spectrum, which would be unfortunate. And additionally, we probably -- we may have to write down some of the DBSD, TerreStar assets because obviously, to the extent we couldn't use them, they probably wouldn't be worth the $3 billion or so that we paid for them. So those are all -- that's kind of where it stands. It's not many companies. Washington picks winners and losers all the time. We're  not the first company that's kind of faced this proposition. But the reason we made the investment and have taken the risk is really because of what the President of the United States has said and what the FCC has said, where the President  said, \"We have a spectrum crunch,\" given many speeches on it, as has  the FCC. He's concerned that companies are hoarding cash and not making investment. And we've gone out and spent actually about $4 billion for spectrum and $3 billion on spectrum and S-band even before we can get approvals. So we're a company that has not hoarded  cash and has gone and invested that to grow the business. And of course, the administration has talked about needed competition in the wireless business and innovation in the wireless business. And I think we have a history of being disruptive in the video business. I think we'd be very disruptive in the wireless business. And so that gives us some degree of confidence that we would meet the standard to be in the public interest to grant the waiver. And if so, then we're prepared to enter the business and go full force to make a business out of it. And I think it would transform not only our company but I think it would transform the way that people use wireless today in the United States. It's  frustrating for me to be in New York City and my phone not work, right? There's really no reason that the phone can't work. It's just an investment to make it work. And there's many features that I see in handsets around the world where the wireless innovation is greater than the United States. And I think much of that could be brought back here. So we're very excited about the business. We've got everything in place and to enter the business. And we'll wait for the next couple of weeks and see whether we're going to be in or out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the outlook for '12 since you guys gave some comments early on. Joe, are you thinking about trying to grow gross adds in 2012? Or do you see churn as the big opportunity as we saw in the fourth quarter to help drive not only market share growth, which was one of the bullets you laid out, but also drive that net income number you guys are sort of targeting as well? And as part of that, do you see yourself looking to unwind some of the discounting? You made some really interesting comments about the alienation of the existing customer base by giving big discounts to new customers. And I think the satellite industry has been offering somewhere around $30 a month off for 12 months for probably over a year now. Is that something you think you guys can unwind or will unwind or try to unwind this year to help on the ARPU side?","Joseph P. Clayton","One, we're  looking at growing gross adds. And two, we're looking at improving churn, which should give us a double bubble. And three, yes, we are looking at trying to simplify our pricing scheme, if you will, to avoid the $31 discounting that you see in the second year of some of our competitors' promotions.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. If I could just -- one follow-up on the broadband side. I don't know if you guys will be willing to size up how many customers you have connected to the Internet today and so what your goal is on the set-top box front. And on the ViaSat satellite broadband deal, is that a product you see as competitive to sort of wireline broadband? You mentioned it will help you in the rural markets, but 12 megabits is a decent speed. I don't know if you thought that was something you can use to go to market in wireline territories. I know you have an agreement with Charter to, at least in some markets, bundle cable broadband with DISH Network TVs. Just curious if you could spend a minute on that as well.","Joseph P. Clayton","One, I do believe it's a great alternative to the 8 million to 10 million rural households that's only alternative is slow-speed DSL. I think it's going to play very fine there. In terms of going forward, I think it'll  actually improve its capabilities in terms of capacity and possibly even speed. But it's not going to be as good as Fiber-to-the-Curb.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack from Nomura Securities.","Michael Liddell - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","This is Mike Liddell in for Mike. So 2 questions. Can you provide any color on the trends in the equipment subsidies both in 4Q and how that will adjust with the new Hopper and Joey boxes? And then secondly, can you provide any color on the impact of the Charter co-marketing deal and how that influenced gross adds in the quarter?","Robert E. Olson","Yes, Mike. I think that with the Hopper, obviously it really depends on what the take rate for the new receiver will be. However, the Hopper has comparable capital expense relative to our current DVRs. And it will generate comparable results.","Thomas A. Cullen","This is Tom Cullen. As far as the Charter relationship, obviously, neither company is disclosing specific subscriber numbers. But we're encouraged -- continue to be encouraged with the progress. We do think that we're kind of operating in an era here of surprising alliances as we've seen over the last couple  months. And many people thought this was surprising when we did it last year. But they, I think, are genuine in their focus that they're increasingly a broadband company more than a video company. We obviously run some risk at the termination or the expiration of the initial contract. But our job is to make sure the customer understands what a damn good video experience we deliver. And then when they're forced with that next opportunity to leave, they'll be convinced to stay with us and with Charter's broadband.","Charles W. Ergen","And this is Charlie. Just a couple of points that Joe has made. In the Hopper, there's the 2 possibilities there that when you go to a multiroom HDTV home, our SAC,  as I see, is less to do that to a Hopper because it can do every TV set in the home and in HD, whereas the products we have today don't do that. They're kind of one HD, one SD. So in a multiroom house, our SAC would actually go down from where it is today. And there is -- and of course, the multiroom DVR, there's a one-time DVR fee, but it's $10 instead of the normal $7. So there's probably a little bit of -- to the extent that the Hopper is successful, there's a little bit of an ARPU potential there as well. So we actually have some opportunity on the SAC side to improve it as we get into more -- multiroom house -- multi-HDTV households and also on the ARPU side. But of course, it depends on the success of the Hopper.","Michael Liddell - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And just one quick follow-up. When does the deal with Charter expire? Is that a trial 1-year deal or is that a multiyear?","Charles W. Ergen","It was set as a 1-year deal with ongoing renewals, and that's where we're at now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi from Standard & Poor's.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","I have a few questions as well. I guess, the first, I'm trying to clarify the Internet-connected subs. So I know there was  earlier a question on that. I wasn't sure if you provided any targets in terms of the connection of Internet subscribers this year. And potentially how do you reconcile that with the DISH Unplugged product that you mentioned, which presumably some of that has been targeted to non-Internet subs? So any color on how you balance that would be helpful, especially in a given market.","Joseph P. Clayton","Well, we do have specific targets, but we're not going to get -- let's just start with that because we don't give guidance. Of course, DISH Unplugged, there will not be targets on that either because that's more of a market-driven situation. So this question is not helping you. My answer is not helping you at all even if you could hear me.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay, that's fine. Let me move on to another question then with regard to Blockbuster. So you've been around, operating around breakeven now for the past 9 months. Now I'm kind of trying to get a sense of how much tolerance do you have for that business in terms of potential losses that you can tolerate, granted that you talk about how you're using it to leverage several other areas of your pay-TV business. So I guess my question is do you perhaps look at that business in isolation from a profit center perspective? Or are you willing to kind of continue to maybe stomach accelerating losses as long as you view the benefits of the pay-TV side as justifying those losses? So any color on that would be helpful.","Thomas A. Cullen","Tuna, it's Tom. Yes, we do look at it as a separate business. And even though there is benefit accruing to the DISH side through the joint efforts, we look at Blockbuster separately and we have low tolerance for losses going forward. So that's why we're watching it very closely, made the changes that we have made. Along with the store closures, of course, comes reduction in overhead that would be more appropriately sized with a smaller store base. Mike Kelly and his team are working this day and night, and I think coming up with some creative ideas on how we can improve the remaining store traffic and revenue. But it's a work in progress, and we will keep a very close eye on it. So our tolerance to your core question is very low.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay. And with regard to the spectrum relocation deal with Sprint, it's my understanding you paid about $114 million in Q4. So I'm just trying to clarify if that payment was expensed or if there's a potential clawback of some of that amount if the waiver is not granted or the regulatory process doesn't go through, would be helpful.","Robert E. Olson","Yes, so Tuna, this is Robert. That payment was classified under other noncurrent assets. We view that as integral to the spectrum purchase. And so we evaluate that along with the amounts we spent on TerreStar and DBSD.","Thomas A. Cullen","So what does that mean? Is it admin expense?","Robert E. Olson","Admin expense.","Thomas A. Cullen","But to your second question, there is no clawback. We view it as another demonstration of what steps we've taken that do serve the public interest to bring more spectrum to the market center. So by clearing up that multiple-year issue that was hanging over the S-band, we think that deserves consideration as well.","Charles W. Ergen","I mean, this is Charlie. I mean, my experience is we're -- I do think that government and businesses have to work together. And I think a lot of CEOs kind of take a different approach. But I've always spent a lot of time trying to work with the government rather than against it. And I think that we've taken some calculated risk, and  Sprint payment being one of them, which obviously would be a waste of money if we can't get into the business. But it also was an obstacle for -- it was a legitimate claim by Sprint, a, and something that other people have committed to and an obstacle for us to get approval. So it made sense for us to take care of that both from a regulatory point of view and also to clear the deck to make it in the public interest. Because that's a standard that in the current environment with some of the criticism that the commission has gotten from the LightSquared side, from Congress, which -- it would obviously make somebody more cautious going forward,  no matter what -- no matter how unordered that criticism might be, when you try to do the right thing, sometimes you get criticism. So you just tend to be more cautious than -- and that's a human nature kind of thing, and I think we just put everything in place that we can to make sure that, that doesn't happen.","Tuna N. Amobi - S&P Equity Research","Okay, that's helpful. And lastly, for Charlie. So you talk about 80% chance of success as your hurdle rate. As you think about the past couple of months, what has happened in wireless environment, whether it's LightSquared or AT&T, T-Mobile, a rejection and what not, how do you see your chances of success  been affected by the events of recent months? And how does that perhaps affect your plans in terms of possible partnerships or other route you might go on the wireless?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I think that's a good question. I think that's one of the reasons timing is so important. I think that the landscape down at the deck has been reshuffled obviously with the rejection of AT&T and T-Mobile merger and obviously with LightSquared not at this point having to overcome their interference issues. So obviously, United States is in even a worse position right now from a spectrum crunch perspective because it's pretty clear that the LightSquared's 40, 50 megahertz isn't going to come into use any time soon. So we think that, that is a positive for where we're trying to go and a large positive. One is we are a company that can relatively immediately work on a spectrum crunch that's been exasperated. And two, because I think it does open up opportunity for partnerships in a variety of way, and obviously, we're prepared to go  it alone in the business, just like we did in DBS because we begged people to build satellites for us, and nobody would, so we had to do it ourselves. Obviously, there's partnership -- relationships that could make a lot of sense for us, could be as simple as something like network sharing, where Sprint has now lost LightSquared as a tenant, at least for the near term. We just saw this morning where T-Mobile is going to build out some more of their network, that could make some sense; there's obviously some other players, that there could be partnerships. And it could be in any variety of -- those could take any variety of shape, and that would potentially be a way to enter the marketplace sooner and reduce risk. And obviously, as rational businesspeople, we look at all those things. But you have to be in the game to be able to do that. And as I said, we're not in the game right now.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett from Bernstein.","Craig Moffett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Charlie, you've talked in the past about the return on new customer acquisition and how you think about the promotional subsidies or the promotional costs of free programming flowing into that. Can you update us kind of how your thinking has evolved,  whether the level of gross adds you're getting today is a function of selection for customers that you think you can earn a good return on? Or is it, as you project forward bigger gross adds, is it because you think you're going to do better in the segments you're already targeting?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I look at whatever -- I look at what it takes to get a customer and what the -- and I add the opportunity cost in my SAC. So I don't look at it us really having a $771 SAC, I look at us having a SAC that's greater than that because of the free programming we give away that we otherwise don't get a margin on, right? And I look at that total cost and then look at how long the consumer -- look at return on investment on the customer. So that's kind of the first step. The second step I look at, that I've been looking at, is what's our ability long term as a customer -- as a company to fight an inevitable competition that's going to come from over-the-top and broadband integration into video. And can we hold -- that even if we weren't giving discounts, can we hold onto  that customer as we kind of project in the future where that's going? So I always think it's kind of crazy -- I think it's crazy to give discounts for 2 years in a 2-year contract because the customer obviously has -- 1 or 2 things is going to happen after those 2 years. The customer is going to go to another provider to get another discount or you're going to have to give that customer a bigger discount to stay with -- continue to give them a discount to stay with you. So you never, ever get a return on that customer. So we've tried to be very disciplined in our approach. We've obviously had -- we've been the least aggressive of anybody in the business in terms of how we discount. And the second thing is we've gone out and tried to prepare for the future, which is to put ourselves on a wireless business, where you're seeing the cable industry sell their wireless assets. And we've positioned ourselves to be in the wireless business, where we think that we could combine and bundle many different services to our current customers, and therefore, increase our likelihood that even though we know there's competitive disruptions coming, that we have a greater likelihood of keeping those customers. And so we're much more confident today that when Joe goes out and gets a customer, that we can hold on to that customer long term because of where we are strategically.","Craig Moffett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Could I ask a follow-up to that then, which is to the extent that you didn't get the waivers, as you talked about, in front of the FCC, would that mean that without a broadband product, you would be less inclined to aggressively go after gross additions in your core business? It sounds like what you're saying is they go hand-in-hand.","Charles W. Ergen","I think there's a high correlation between what we're going to do in wireless and our current business. And to the extent that we're not able to enter the wireless business, then I think you've got to look at all alternatives in terms of where you would go long term. And that might be that -- I think that there's -- I think that the business we're in today in wireless is really kind of a packaged deal, to be honest with you. I think that you have to put those 2 together as long term because no customer wants just fixed video. He's going to buy mobile video and he's going to buy mobile data and he's going to buy mobile voice and he's going to buy fixed data. So he's going to buy a bundle of services. And right now, the cable industry is the best-positioned to take advantage of that, and probably AT&T and Verizon. AT&T and Verizon have 60% of the market. And I hope this is an administration that wants some competition to that. But the way not to get competition to that is not to make decisions, right, and to be cautious. And then you're going to end up with AT&T and Verizon probably having 70% or 80% of the market, right? And so, and you've seen Verizon  do a very smart thing in buying the cable spectrum. So we'd like to play, but you've got to get asked to the dance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe from Barclays Capital.","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two if I could. First of all, have you gotten any pushback from the networks regarding the PrimeTime Anytime offering and essentially making that content available on-demand? And secondly, if you could just -- any more color regarding the impact you saw from existing customers regarding Blockbuster Movie Pass thus far and its rollout. What sort of take-up you're seeing or if you're seeing any impact on churn?","Joseph P. Clayton","Okay. I'll take the first one first -- or the last one first. We did have a positive impact on Blockbuster Movie Pass. I think for the small increases that we received, I think I would attribute that to the Blockbuster Movie Pass and to some seasonality. And the first portion was?","James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The first one, on PrimeTime Anytime and what sort of response you've gotten thus far from the broadcasters themselves on it.","Joseph P. Clayton","There was some interest given by how it works by 1 broadcaster. Outside of that, it's been very quiet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bishop Cheen from Wells Fargo.","Bishop Cheen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Going back to your big picture talk about spectrum and the management of it via the administration and Congress, how confident are you that both the White House and Congress will move forward in a timely fashion to try and get spectrum out to the marketplace and to manage it without undue bottlenecks?","Charles W. Ergen","Well, I guess I'd say 2 things. I think that beyond our application at the FCC, right, that's just a couple of weeks away from being decided on, there really is no clear-cut way to allocate more spectrum in a timely manner really for 2 reasons. One, there's not a lot of spectrum out there. And two, the Congress and the White House really can't do it unilaterally because, for example, one of the biggest places that you might find spectrum might be in the broadcasters' side, where the broadcasters would voluntarily,  based on the recent budget legislation was passed, would have to voluntarily give that up. There's some spectrum that the Department of Defense has. They'd  have to voluntarily to give it up. That's not normally something that they do readily, given the effect on perhaps our defense of the country. And there's some other spectrum that's within the FCC that will have to be looked at. And that typically would go through  a rulemaking process that'll  take a long time. So I'm not confident there's any -- I don't see anything on the horizon that brings much spectrum into the marketplace anytime  soon. And probably the best hope is the D-block. I think there's some spectrum in the D-block for public safety that's got some possibility of moving forward in the next couple  years. So really, that's one of the things that give us some hope that we would approved because obviously we could come into the marketplace and start working on it within a couple  weeks. And it would seem a little bit unusual. To me, it would seem a bit unusual to go through -- I think we first filed our application in May of last year, so you go 9 or 10 months, and then you decide at the end of that process to do a rulemaking when you probably could have decided to do the rulemaking 9 or 10 months ago, if that was the route you wanted to go. So I think we're kind of the country's best hope. And I think that, that's a good position to be in. But I will say that Washington -- many companies and CEOs and chairmans have been blindsided. Washington works in funny ways, and it's a complicated process. And there's issues that we wouldn't know about that they might have at the administration level or the FCC that we just wouldn't have visibility to, that'd just be issues that we wouldn't know about behind the scenes that would cause people to make decisions that otherwise might not seem logical.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan from Collins Stewart.","Thomas W. Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","I guess, first, a follow-up question. Charlie, you mentioned that there's a possibility of the FCC initiating some kind of NPRM rulemaking on the waiver. So if there is an NPRM on the waiver, would you sell the spectrum? And then I have a follow-up.","Charles W. Ergen","I think if they went to rulemaking, that we'd look at the risk profile, which if we look at it today, would say that our risk profile would increase substantially. And I think it would \u2013 it may be too risky for us to enter the business place. In which case, all options would be on the table for how we would move forward with the company and the spectrum.","Thomas W. Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","You had said before that you had thought...","Charles W. Ergen","Today, the only option on the table for us is we want to get in the business. And we spent a lot of time and hard work to get there, and we're ready.","Thomas W. Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","You had said before that the chances of probability were about 80% previously. What do you think the probability is of the waiver being approved?","Charles W. Ergen","I'd go broke betting on Washington. I'm about over 100 in Washington, so I'm hoping that -- you know that Dumb & Dumber line? I think there's a chance. We just haven't -- we haven't been very successful normally, which is why we're paying higher retrans fees. We're not very successful.","Thomas W. Eagan - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division","And then I have a follow-up. Robert, you mentioned that -- the net income being roughly flat. And I'm not sure if I quite got what you were saying. But assuming that the revenue growth is going to be somewhat limited and assuming that there's going to be increased marketing expenses, should we think that the EBITDA margin decline is going to be offset by a positive that would be below the line?","Robert E. Olson","Tom, no. I think, once again, to clarify, you have to pull out the litigation accrual that occurred in 2011, accrual reversal. And then as I clarified before, it's on the pay-TV business. So to the fact -- to the extent that the spectrum business, once we start consolidating that, it'll bring depreciation and some administrative expenses, I need a pullback on that. Then just focusing on the pay-TV business, the challenge for us is to continue to do a good job of controlling expenses. Obviously, programming expenses are going to go up. And then the success factor for us in 2012 is our ability to sell up on revenue. It won't get us a lot of ARPU, but it'll get us some. And that's the thing we need to deliver in order to hit our targets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Mitchell from Brean Murray.","Todd T. Mitchell - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little about the Blockbuster over-the-top tie-in to the DISH Network and whether it was more impactful as a churn mitigation for existing customers or if it helps you drive gross adds?","Joseph P. Clayton","So obviously, we think it's helped us grow gross adds by evidence of the performance in the second quarter -- third quarter -- fourth quarter. The Blockbuster brand is a significant brand in the marketplace, which focuses on family and movies. And that's clearly what DISH is all about. And it's also the reason that we're changing it just slightly to DISH @Home with our first quarter promotion, which adds 6,000 streaming titles. We see this as both an acquisition and as a retention tool because a large portion of that new product is also Hispanic. 70% of our new customers are Hispanic. And it is a growth category for us.","Todd T. Mitchell - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And can you talk about just in terms of your acquisition of streaming rights for that offering, how far along are you in doing that? And is there some way that you feel that you're approaching it different than some of your competitors? For instance, do you feel that with the -- basically, the Hopper recording all of the networks, that it can be Sling-ed on without streaming rights?","Thomas A. Cullen","This is Tom. As you saw, we added some additional content to the Blockbuster @Home product in January. We continue to look at additional content offerings both for DISH and non-DISH. And I would say between DISH and EchoStar, we'll continue to work on streaming options, but we don't have anything further to disclose today.","Todd T. Mitchell - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. And lastly, I noticed that TiVo is no longer supporting the Blockbuster Online store. What, if anything, should we read in, into that? Is that part of a relaunch strategy? And also, what would your -- what is your strategy with regards to UltraViolet?","Thomas A. Cullen","I'm sorry, on the first part, what was the question on TiVo?","Todd T. Mitchell - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Well,  I just noticed that TiVo is no longer supporting the Blockbuster store, the online store.","Thomas A. Cullen","Yes. So it's underlying platform changes that we're pursuing, as I said earlier, between DISH and EchoStar. And so that, by de facto, you lose some of the distribution as you make those changes. And I'm sorry, and the second part? UltraViolet. Okay. So UltraViolet obviously is a promising development and concept. I'd say it's still in the early innings in developing. But that's an opportunity for us to forge tighter relationships with the studios that would benefit the stores as an example. Because the studios do -- most of the studios, I should say, they're not all in lockstep,  do see opportunity with UltraViolet and having a physical location and being able to do some -- to provide access to the existing store traffic that we have has changed the conversation a little bit with the studios.","Operator","And there's no further calls.  Back to the presenters.","Thomas A. Cullen","All right. Well, see you next time; May, I guess. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
