[Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to David Collins for their reading of the forward-looking statements. ","David Collins","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Today's conference call may include forward-looking statements including statements regarding Lennar's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. Forward-looking statements represent only Lennar's estimates on the date of this conference call and are not intended to give any assurance as to actual future results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect future results and may cause Lennar's actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described in this morning's press release and our SEC filings, including those under the caption risk factors contained in Lennar's annual report on form 10-K most recently filed with the SEC. Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. ","Operator","I'd like to introduce our host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin. ","Stuart Miller","Great, thank you and thanks, David. This morning, I'm out west with Rick Beckwitt, our President; John Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; and Eric Fader from our Rialto Group. We're going to begin our trade partners summit later tonight. That's why we're out here and this is where we invite many of our manufactures, suppliers and distributors to discuss the homebuilding landscape and to consider better ways to partner and to keep costs and profitability properly aligned. ","On the call from Miami we have Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dianne Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and of course, David Collins, our Controller, who delivered our forward-looking statement; and we also have Jeff Crasnov, CEO of Rialto. I want to apologize in advance if we're a little disjointed as we're going to attempt to coordinate from different locations. ","As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview and Bruce will deliver further detail and guidance. As always, after our prepared overview, we will open to Q&A and I'd like to request again that you limit your time to one question, one follow-up so we can enable as many participants as possible within the hour that we've allotted. ","So let me go ahead and begin and start by saying that market conditions certainly feel like they are strong and strengthening. The slow and steady, though sometimes erratic, market improvement that we've seen for the entirety of this recovery seems to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal. ","While our first quarter operating results, particularly gross margins, reflect some of the sluggishness seen at the end of last year, our sales results went from tepid to better to strong as the quarter progressed. Limited supply and production deficits are now intersecting with land and labor shortage and this suggests, though not yet seen, but suggests, that pricing power is on the horizon as we move through the year. ","So what are the factors that are driving the change in market sentiment and condition? They're certainly not apparent if you listen to the news stations. As our traffic has increased, we're getting some very direct feedback from our customers as they tell us what they are looking for, their timing and, sometimes, their motivation. ","There's clearly a sense of general optimism in the market. There's a perception that jobs are being created and that wages are actually starting to move upward. There's a solidifying sense that the government has adopted a business-friendly posture and that will result in real changes to tax rates and to the regulatory environment. ","The banking world is making more overtures to small businesses and to mortgage borrowers and there's a sense that borrowers can make their way through the process. Additionally, the upward direction of interest rates has encouraged some to get off the fence and consider purchasing a home rather than renting. Rents have risen and the prospect of higher purchase prices and higher interest rates makes a compelling case that today's opportunity might be the best opportunity to leave those annual increases in monthly payments behind. ","Although there's also a lot of negative noise at the same time, it seems, so far, that the market is looking through the noise and is injecting optimism about the future in its purchase consideration. Additionally, the economic realities of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic realities of rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision-making for the first-time buyer as millennials are coming to market. Interestingly, the front page of U.S.A Today reports today that 60% of millennials ages 18 to 35 are living with parents, relatives and roommates and that is a 115-year high. ","Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the improvement in the market. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we're expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve and will exceed expectations, particularly in the back half of the year. ","Although our first quarter earnings were lower compared to the first quarter of 2016, that is primarily due to a higher tax rate, some one-time WCI closing costs and a fully expected decline in gross margin. While some of the same pressures will exist in the second quarter as well, the acceleration in sales pace against a limited supply and constrained capacity for the market to quickly increase production portends pricing power and a very strong second half of the year. ","Against that back drop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. Our for sale core homebuilding operations are extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Our sales were up 11% year-over-year before WCI, 12% including WCI, driven by our strategy of driving better quality traffic through our digital marketing efforts. ","Interestingly, our internet leads were up 18% year-over-year to about 100,000 for the quarter. Our social media followers were up 17% year-over-year to 2.8 million on an annual basis and YouTube views were up by 10 million for the year. ","Fueled by our digital marketing efforts and other initiatives as well, we continue to focus on operational efficiency as our SG&A is at an historic low for our first quarter. Again, interestingly, our marketing and advertising spend is now down year-over-year for nine consecutive quarters. We continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency and we're improving. ","And while we match production with sales pace, we continue to maximize our gross and net margin at 21.1% and 10.8% respectively as we maintain higher sales price in order to maximize returns on our valuable land assets and we manage costs by striving to be the builder of choice to the trades in each of our markets. Our trade partners summit that I mentioned earlier is a big part of that effort. ","Though some might be concerned by our lower gross margin, we're exactly where we expected to be in the first part of this year and our year-end margin will still be right on top of our guidance. Of course, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter and that transaction is going very well. It is being guided by Rick Beckwitt and his team lead by Fred Rothman and Darren McMurray and I've asked Rick to speak specifically to this transaction, so let me turn it over briefly to Rick. ","Rick Beckwitt","Thanks, Stuart. On February 10, 2017, Lennar closed on the acquisition of WCI Communities that was previously announced in September 2016. The purchase price for WCI totaled approximately $643 million which we funded with cash and we also assume $250 million in senior notes. The transaction combined two of the largest home builders in Florida and significantly expands Lennar's product offerings to include luxury, single-family and multi-family homes. ","WCI is focused on amenity-rich lifestyle master plan communities catering to the move-up active adult and second home buyers, truly compliments Lennar's leading market position in the entry-level and move-up markets in Florida. During our extensive due diligence period, we identified five main drivers of value creation and synergies. I will go through each of these drivers in a second, but I'm happy to say that the WCI integration has gone very smoothly and that we're ahead of schedule which will lead to a timely realization of this value creation for our shareholders. ","The first driver was WCI's portfolio of low-cost land, located in most of the highest growth and largest Florida coastal markets. We acquired over 13,500 home sites, adding 51 actively selling communities and an additional pipeline of future community openings for the next several years. This land portfolio will produce strong gross margins going forward. ","The portfolio included many large amenity-rich A plus master plan communities that would be impossible to purchase in today's land constrained market. We have great confidence that we will produce extremely strong returns from these assets as they will be managed by some of the best performing and most profitable positions in our Company. ","When we closed the acquisition, we acquired 361 homes in backlog with an average sales price of $516,000, totaling $188 million in near term revenue and cash flow. In addition, at the end of the first quarter, we had 942 WCI homes in various stages of construction. ","The second driver was the value maximization of the communities through the reallocation of the WCI and Lennar product and branding. During the due diligence period, we analyzed each community to determine whether we would make higher returns and profits by building WCI product or Lennar product. Approximately 1\/3 of the communities that we acquired will be converted to the Lennar brand. ","In these communities, Lennar has product that is very similar to WCI and by converting these communities to the Lennar brand, we will significantly lower our build cost with very little, if any, impact on the sales price of the home. We will also significantly increase sales pace and reduce cycle times. These changes will increase both profitability and IRR. ","We've also identified several Lennar communities that we will be building WCI product. In these communities, we will be able to achieve much higher sales prices with the WCI brand. ","We're also planning to build both WCI and Lennar brands in some of our larger communities to benefit from a dual marketing strategy. This will allow us to increase absorptions and maximize the value of our underlying land positions. This is something we've done very successfully with our higher-priced Village Builders brand in Texas. ","The third driver is utilizing our efficient homebuilding operating platform and leveraging our purchasing power. Included in this is streamlining WCIs approach to options. ","While we will still offer WCI home buyers a selection of high quality options and upgrades, we will be restructuring their design studio to include a more streamlined selection of options and upgrades. This is similar to what we do in Texas and has allowed us to offer options and upgrades with a more cost effective G&A structure. ","Given our leading national and Florida positions, Lennar can purchase materials and labor at a much lower price than WCI. This will not only lower build costs, but provide greater value to the WCI home buyers. Cost savings will also flow from reduced cycle time. ","We've been working with our trade partners to re-bid the WCI floor plans and make them more efficient to build. We expect to have this completed by the end of our second quarter. However, you will not see the full benefits of lower cost per square foot until 2018 once all of the acquired inventory and homes under construction are delivered. ","Based on our due diligence and work to date, we expect to save between $8 to $12 per square foot or 200 to 300 basis points on new starts once the re-bidding process is completed. And finally, given the strides we've made in digital marketing, we expect lower sales and marketing costs associated with these WCI communities as well. ","The fourth driver was the synergies associated with lowering G&A costs. These include the elimination of costs associated with running two public companies as well as headcount reductions associated with overlapping corporate and operating functions. While there will be some upfront costs associated with implementing these changes, we anticipate annualized savings of approximately $30 million beginning in late 2017. ","I'm sad to say that Keith Bass, the CEO of WCI, will not be moving forward with Lennar. While I'd hoped that Keith would join us and be a big part of our growth going forward, he has chosen to take some time off and explore some other opportunities. We wish Keith great success going forward and thank him and the entire WCI team for building such an incredible Company. ","Finally, the last driver was capturing incremental profits through the rollout of our mortgage and title operations to WCIs homebuilding operations and its Berkshire Hathaway home services operation. This process has begun and we should see a meaningful pickup in activity in financial services as we move into 2018. In conclusion, we're very excited about this acquisition and while we're focused on these five value creation ideas, we're certain that we'll find other areas that will benefit our shareholders. ","I'll turn it back over to Stuart. ","Stuart Miller","Great. Thanks, Rick. As you can see, I think we've got our WCI transaction well in hand and we're very enthusiastic about it. So to wrap up homebuilding, I wanted to say we've noted before that our strategy remains a clear pivot in land strategy towards a shorter term land acquisition and towards a 7% to 10% growth strategy. Given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rates should be on the higher side of our goals or a little over that goal. ","We've also refocused on expanding our first-time buyer offering with our mix now standing at right around 40%. Combined, these strategic elements will continue to produce very strong cash flow for the Company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement. ","Now let me turn briefly to our other segments. As you've seen, our financial services segment is also off to a great start in 2017. Of course, the business is growing in lock step with our homebuilding operations and will expand with the addition of the WCI acquisition, but it's also expanding its non-Lennar business reach and growing bottom line. Financial services results exceeded last year's first quarter result by 38%, driven in part by increased profitability in title operations and Bruce, who overseas this operation, will give additional color in his portion. ","Lennar multi-family. We couldn't be more pleased with the evolution and performance of LMC. Our entry into the apartment development business was timed perfectly and LMC continues to execute flawlessly. LMC, under the leadership of Todd Farrell, has reached maturity and is poised for continuous annual profitability. ","As noted in our press release, this segment generated $19.2 million in pretax income, up 57% from last year as we sold another two communities under our merchant build program. During the first quarter, we started some 1,373 apartments in five communities with a total development cost of approximately $600 million. ","As of February 28, 2017, we had a geographically diverse pipeline of 74 communities, totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes with a total development cost of almost $8 billion. We're gearing up our build-to-core program that we've discussed in the past with some 20 communities for 6,000 apartments already under construction to fill the $2.2 billion equity bucket with geographically diversified A-located, brand new and modern apartment communities in a generally shelter constrained environment. ","Rialto also turned in an excellent quarter. Rialto contributed $12 million to the bottom line this quarter as market conditions favored this business segment as well. The various elements of Rialto are starting to take shape as we continue to work through the remaining legacy assets on book. ","In this quarter, we have started to book some of the long awaited promote from fund one which reflects the work of the extraordinary team of professionals investing and managing third-party capital and generating industry-leading returns. Additionally, market conditions particularly favored Rialto Mortgage Finance, as that exceptionally run team which is focused on the commercial mortgage conduit business, exceeded expectations and closed three transactions totaling $478 million. The intersection of an outstanding operating team and strong market conditions produced an industry-leading net margin for the Company. ","Finally, FivePoint remains poised as a self-sufficient standalone large-scale community builder in California. This Company manages and controls some of the best positioned properties in some of the most land constrained markets in the country. The current market optimism raises the possibility that this Company, that's been waiting for market conditions to reopen the IPO market, might just find a window to go public. We'll see if the current sweep of optimism in the capital and stock markets sets the stage for FivePoint's future. ","So in conclusion, across the platform of our Company, we're feeling pretty optimistic about this year ahead. We're clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on the strong market conditions that seem apparent. ","Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform in strengthening market conditions. People, assets and operations are all aligned to perform in 2017 and we look forward to keeping you updated. ","With that, let me turn it over to Bruce. ","Bruce Gross","Thanks, Stuart and good morning. Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter, driven by a 13% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a consistent average selling price of $365,000. WCI had a minimal impact to revenues in the first quarter as there were only 51 deliveries from the acquisition date until the end of the quarter. ","Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 21.1% and as Stuart mentioned, we're still on track with our previously stated gross margin goal of 22% to 22.5% for the full year. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land and construction costs. Our gross margin percentage was impacted 10 basis points due to the write-off of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the first quarter. ","Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, but it improved sequentially from our fourth quarter total of 6.2%. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our homebuilding east segment. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot and that was driven by approximately a 6% increase in labor and 3% in material costs. ","SG&A percentage, as a percent of home sale revenue in the first quarter, was 10.3%. We're continuing to improve SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from the focus on technology investments that Stuart mentioned. Included in the SG&A in the first quarter were one-time expenses related to the WCI acquisition, mainly offset by one-time legal and insurance benefits resulting in a net one-time charge of approximately $2.7 million or 10 basis points impact to SG&A percent during the quarter. ","Other income was $5.7 million compared to other expense of $600,000 in the same period last year. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $11.5 million which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incurred G&A costs while ramping up for our future land sales. ","During the quarter, we opened 58 new communities and added 51 net communities from the WCI acquisition to end the quarter with 752 net active communities. New homeowners increased 12% and new order dollar value increased 16% for the quarter. WCI had a minimal impact to this number, as they were only 70 new home orders from this acquisition since we only had a couple of weeks in that first quarter post acquisition. ","Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at three sales per community per month versus 2.9 and that improved sequentially throughout the quarter. The cancellation rate was 16%. In the first quarter, we purchased approximately 8,300 home sites, totaling $659 million and just to note, the first quarter usually has the largest dollar amount of land purchases for the year. ","Including the home sites from the WCI acquisition, our home sites owned and controlled now total 173,000 home sites, of which 137,000 are owned and 36,000 are controlled. We now have approximately 4.6 years' supply of land owned based on this year's projected deliveries. We expect the year of supply of land to continue to decline as we continue with our soft pivot land strategy. Our completed unsold homes at the end of the quarter were in our normal range of one to two per community, totaling 1,342 homes. ","Turning to financial services, this segment had strong results with operating earnings of $20.7 million compared to $14.9 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased slightly to $13.4 million from $13 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by higher volume. Mortgage originations increased to $1.8 billion versus $1.7 billion in the prior year and the capture rate of Lennar home buyers was 81% compared to 82% in the prior year. ","Our title companies profit increased to $6.8 million during the quarter from $2 million in the prior year and this was driven by a 15% increase in revenue during the quarter and the associated overhead leverage from this higher volume. ","Turning to the Rialto segment and providing more details, the operating earnings were $12 million compared to $1.9 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of non-controlling interests. The Investment Management business contributed $34.4 million of earnings, primarily due to $33.4 million of management fees and other and this included $10 million of carried interest received in the quarter relating to Fund One. ","At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate funds one and two now totals approximately $125 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $478 million of commercial loans into three securitizations, resulting in earnings of $33.2 million compared to $380 million and $3.9 million in the prior year respectively and these are both before their G&A expenses. ","The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in volume and average net margins of the securitizations from 1.6% in the prior year to 7.1% in the first quarter. Our direct investments had a loss of $15.9 million during the quarter as we continued to work towards monetizing the remaining assets purchased from early portfolios. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $33.3 million for the quarter and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $6.4 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $163 million of cash. ","Turning to the multi-family segment, I'll just add a couple of comments to what Stuart mentioned. The $19.2 million of operating profit in the quarter was driven by the segment's $26 million share of gains from the sale of two operating properties as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses. ","Our tax rate for the quarter was 34%. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 28.1% because the prior year had one-time adjustments due to an IRS settlement and energy credits. We expect the tax rate to be 34% approximately for the remainder of 2017. ","Turning to the balance sheet which remains strong, we had a net debt to total capital of 41.6% which was an improvement of 370 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with over $640 million of cash and only $250 million of borrowings on our $1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility. Additionally, we grew stockholders' equity by 24% year-over-year to $7.2 billion and our book value per share grew to $30.70 per share. ","The preliminary goodwill estimate from the WCI acquisition is $150 million to $175 million and that's subject to revision as it is still being reviewed, both internally and externally. During the quarter, we issued $600 million of 4 1\/8% senior notes due 2022 and we added $250 million of 6 7\/8% senior notes due 2021 as part of the WCI acquisition which we're likely to refinance at the next call date in August. ","Finally, I would like to update our goals for 2017. Some of you already included WCI in your estimates for 2017 and all of the numbers that I'll be providing here include the full impact of the WCI acquisition which will be accretive in 2017. ","Starting with deliveries, we're increasing our delivery goal to between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 75% to 80% for the second quarter, 75% to 80% for the third quarter and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We're still expecting an average sales price between $365,000 and $370,000 for the full year and we're right on track with our operating margins of around 13% for the full year. ","There will be an impact to our second quarter gross margin from writing up WCI's backlog in purchase accounting. As a result, we expect our second quarter gross margin percentage to be between 21% and 21.5%, while the full-year gross margin is still expected, as I mentioned, to be 22% to 22.5%. ","We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to between 9.1% to 9.3% for the full year. The second quarter will have some non-recurring transition costs relating to the WCI integration, therefore, we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.5% in Q2. The operating leverage will be in the second half of the year to match up with our highest volume quarters. ","Financial services, we're increasing the goal to approximately $160 million for the year with the second quarter expected to be approximately $40 million. The increase is due to the partial-year inclusion of the Berkshire Hathaway Realty Services brokerage operation from the WCI acquisition as well as additional closings from the WCI deal. We're adding WCI to our mortgage platform, although keep in mind, 50% of the WCI buyers use all cash and we will focus on capturing a high percentage of the other 50% that require a mortgage. ","Rialto is still expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year, with the second quarter expected to be approximately $5 million. Multi-family is still expected to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year, the second quarter is expected to be also approximately $5 million which includes one apartment community sale. ","The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income is still expected to be in a range of $70 million to $80 million of profit for the year. However, the second quarter is expected to have net expenses of $15 million to $20 million, while the second half of 2017 is driving all the profit for this category. ","Corporate G&A is still expected to be 2.2% to 2.3% and our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities. And last, our balance sheet, we still continue to expect a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we accomplished in the prior year. With these updated goals in mind, we're well positioned for the remainder of 2017. ","And with that, let me turn it back to the Operator to open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is now open. ","Carl Reichardt","Stuart, I wanted to ask about your comment related to pricing power. First of all, does the overall guidance for the year assume that you'll be able to push those prices? Is that largely on the low end where you think you might be able to do that and in the context of the potential for higher rates, flattening rents, certainly plenty of competition from peers, what gives you confidence that you may have that ability? ","Stuart Miller","Interesting. Carl, our guidance is really tied to the current state, the current market environment, the way that we see things right now. The discussion, the statements that I made on the conference call, on the, my prepared comments and in our quote, really are kind of forward-looking given the temperament of the market right now and kind of what we see around the corner or what we feel like we're seeing around the corner. ","I don't want to get too far out over our skis. We're not injecting that optimism in our guidance right now, but what we're seeing and what we've heard a lot about, is supply constraint across all kinds, all dwelling product types from rental to for sale and we have also seen that we're land constrained and production constrained and that's been the case for some time. ","The injection of some market optimism and what we saw in our sales pace as we went through the quarter really gives me reason to believe that as we look out ahead a couple of quarters, we're going to start to see prices move just as we would expect with a demand and supply imbalance, with demand increasing and supply somewhat constrained. So that's kind of where we're on that. Our guidance was really rooted in where we've seen things on more current basis. ","Carl Reichardt","And my follow-up is you made a comment about banks making more overtures to borrowers. And I wonder if you could flesh that out in terms of mortgage lending, particularly to first-time customers and then also, in terms of community banks or I guess even money center banks, financing developers and the potential that you could start to see some more opportunities to option finish lots, since that's been, something that's been lacking for awhile. Thanks, Stuart. ","Stuart Miller","Yes, sure. So my comments about banks is more narrative that we're hearing from the banks than actual action in the field at this point. The banks are definitely starting to talk about the regulatory environment shifting and the enforcement environment shifting and reverting to a more normal state. ","The banks are starting to talk about their ability to think about getting back into the mortgage market and lending to smaller businesses which I think is sorely needed and these things will all ripple through the housing market in a positive way. Let's go on to the next question. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Alan Ratner. Your line is now open. ","Alan Ratner","My questions relate to the cost side and, Stuart, maybe since you're on the verge of meeting with a bunch of your trades, hopefully, you'll get more insights here. But, if you look out in California, there's been some pretty wet weather there and I know there's some concern that we might see something similar to what happened in 2015 as an industry when I think Texas in particular felt some pretty significant headwinds from a wet Spring. As the year went on, I think a lot of builders struggled to get homes closed and costs went up. And you guys obviously navigated that very well, but it certainly does create risk from the industry is concerned as far as costs going up. ","So, A, I'm curious what you're hearing there as far as the general availability of labor and the industry's ability to deal with some of those weather headwinds. And second question, just about California specifically, there's some news about a proposed bill out there that would potentially raise construction costs quite a bit, with the prevailing wage requirement in communities there. So, I was curious if you looked at that at all, what impact that might have, given your pretty significant land position in California and how you would handicap the likelihood of that passing at this point. Thank you. ","Stuart Miller","Okay so, wow, that's a real fist full of questions. Let's start with the California question and let's remember that there are always legislative moves afoot to alter the landscape in California. The legislation that's proposed at this point is just another one of those that comes down the pike on a pretty regular basis and we'll just have to see where it works out. ","It's a bill that, if implemented as it's described, would have an impact on costs relative to residential construction. Some communities out there, including some of our larger scale communities in FivePoint, might be exempt from the legislation, so it would be a mixed bag of impacts, some of them positive, some of them negative. I think, overall, negative for affordability in California and so this is going to be talked through, worked out and see where we actually end up. ","But this is the landscape in California and I think that all of these type of legislative initiatives come with positive and negative impacts and we'll just have to see where this one shakes out. As it relates to construction costs overall, the story around construction costs has been one of increases over the past many quarters. You've heard us talk about that. ","I think that as we think about our numbers, construction costs as a percentage of our sales price has probably moved up around 100 basis points and there's most certainly pressure on construction costs in the labor constrained market and this is why we focus on our trade partner Summit, our relationship with our trade partners, making sure that we're the builder of choice for our trade partners. ","We think that this is a strategic advantage for the Company and we've spent a lot of time developing relationships throughout our trade. So let me just turn it over to Jon and ask him because Jon really spear-headed this effort within the Company and has done a remarkable job. ","Jon Jaffe","So, clearly, the pressures remain from a labor constrained market. What we see a little bit different is we have seen some pressure on the material side. Lumber, for example, is up about 9% since December and we've seen an impact there and even with all of the commodities, they all have moved up. In part, in reaction to expected expenditures by the government with infrastructure and that's affecting the supply chain. But as Stuart mentioned, our focus is that those cost pressures are going to be what they are. ","And we position ourselves to how we take advantage of the marketplace of what our landscapes in front of us and I think we have excellent communication relationships with our trade to make sure we're well positioned. There will be a spike of activity once the weather dries up in California, as you know and we're in deep discussions with all our trades about how to manage that as it comes out and I think we'll navigate those waters very well. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. ","Stephen Kim","Stuart, I wanted to ask or maybe Rick could also chime in here, I guess, on the community count guide. It was a little lower than what we had been thinking initially and, I guess, obviously, demand has been better than expected than we might have thought. ","And so, we're trying to figure out whether or not this means that you're going to be selling out of communities a little quicker or if it means, on the other hand, that in response to the strong demand, you're going to actually open up more communities to the greatest of your ability. And so how that all nets out. We're curious as to whether or not you think that you're going to be able to accelerate community openings as you get maybe into the back half a little bit more than what you, than what your guidance would seem to suggest. ","Are you just being conservative in that regard or do you think the cost demand is going to be good? Just going to sell out of stuff a little quicker and so maybe it's not until 2018 that we see an improvement in -- an additional step up in community count. ","Rick Beckwitt","So, Steve, this is Rick. I think you really nailed it. It's a combination of some acceleration of absorptions in some really well located communities. That combined with weather impacts that have delayed some of our communities opening and there's also a portion of it where we buy home sites from third party developers and we can't control the schedule that they deliver the home sites to us. I think as we approach the back half of the year, you'll start to see an acceleration of community count. Clearly into 2018, we'll be on a pretty good run rate at that point. ","Stuart Miller","Steve, let me just chime in and say that community count is Rick's least favorite number. ","Stephen Kim","Yes, likewise. ","Stuart Miller","It is the one number that is like three-dimensional chess trying to figure it out there. A lot of moving parts as you go through the year. There's some prediction, anticipation, some guesswork and it's because, as demand moves around a little bit, as weather impacts, as third party participants, as we have moderated down our ownership of land, we're more dependent on third party. All of these places play a part in making it a hard number to get your head around and so we do conservatize it a little bit as well. ","Stephen Kim","Sure, well good news is you always have price which you can use to modulate things too, so that's good. My second question relates to tax rates and I know that tax policy is certainly a very nebulous issue right now. However, it doesn't stop people from running some hypotheticals and I imagine your Company is no different. ","So, obviously, if the corporate tax rate were to drop, that will be fairly straightforward. However, in the case of builders, there's at least three things that seem to be coming up in conversations with investors that could be offset. I was curious if you might be able to opine on in general sense of order of magnitude how this all may come out in the wash, those other three components being the reduction of interest deductibility, energy tax credits and perhaps the manufacture's deduction and maybe I'm missing something else. But, could you give us a sense for what the relative order of magnitude is in terms of the size of the significance of these three pieces to your tax rate? ","Stuart Miller","Well, you're right, we've definitely looked and we're looking at each of the component parts. I will say that I've had a recent opportunity to listen to Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, who seems to be in a lead position there. And the two things that I take away from listening to him is that he's very smart, very thoughtful in his approach and I frankly derived a lot of confidence listening to him walk through the thinking. ","The other thing that I walked away with is a sense that he and this administration are listening carefully knowing that there will be winners and losers, there will be ups and downs, in any configuration of the tax revamp and so there is, virtually, no ability to draw certainty today from what pieces and in what proportion they are going to be woven into a new tax program. So with that, Bruce, why don't you take a swipe at giving some relative proportion to the various pieces? ","Bruce Gross","Sure. If you look at our current tax rate of 34%, the question is going to be whether it goes down -- what rate it goes down to, but for the three items you mentioned, Steve. Energy credits which we do have some, we have the manufacturing credit and the interest deduction, corporate interest deduction. Those three, based on our current numbers, are approximately 5%, give or take, so that would take the 34% rate down to about 29% or so. ","I'm sorry. There would be about 5% in total from those of a reduction from the 34% and I need to just add one more component. If the tax rate went down to 20%, that's where we'd get down to about a 5% reduction of call it 29%. If the tax rate was maybe coming down to 25%, in conjunction with that, then it would be pretty much a push and there wouldn't be any positive impact. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen East. Your line is now open. From Wells Fargo. ","Stephen East","Stuart, you gave a ton of information, so I'll try to keep my compound questions to a minimum here, but on the order growth side of it, obviously, you're seeing a lot of acceleration as you go through. You talked about a bit. Can you give us a bit more color about what's going on, where you're seeing it more? It sounded like entry level was a big part of it and yet at the same time, your incentives have moved up and your growth rate was above your targeted rate. So I'm just trying to reconcile the incentives versus what you all are seeing on the ground and how you want to manage that demand as you move through the year. ","Jon Jaffe","Hello, Steve. You really see the absorption pace moderate by market. So, for example, California and the Pacific Northwest are strongest from a pace. California is up 4.5 sales per community. I think that our Company average is three. So, in those markets, you see that incentives, you see more pricing power. And in other markets, the Tampa and Orlando, we saw healthy pace there of 3.7 sales per community. ","Even in Houston we saw an improvement as we reduced our community count, but our sales pace picked up a little bit year-over-year. So, in those markets, I'd say that it affects both the starter price point and the move-up price points. In Texas which is marked as more flattish from a sales pace standpoint, there you see a differential where the first time buyer product moves at a faster pace than the move-up product. ","Stephen East","Okay and from an incentive perspective, I assume as you go through the year, we would expect to see that come down. Is that a fair expectation? ","Jon Jaffe","Yes, that's what we expect. We're setting out in the winter months, December, January, we saw more incentives. We've seen that come down and we would expect to see that continue to come down. ","Stephen East","Okay. And then, on the gross margin, you all are comfortable with it moving back up to full year, staying within your range and yet, it surprised us below what we were expecting. I guess a couple of things, given that you've got a lot of cost flowing through lumber, et cetera, labor, land, what gives you the comfort there that you're going to be able to, one, not only cover that cost, but make it up quite a bit? And then how much in purchase accounting is embedded for WCI in that 20% to 22.5%? ","Stuart Miller","Let me start and then have Rick and Jon weigh in, but as I said in my opening remarks, some of what you saw in our gross margin reflects some of the sluggishness that we saw towards the end of last year. Remember that what we're selling two quarters ago, we're closing now and as we went through the election season, as we went through some reconciliations in November, the market was a little bit slower than reported and we saw that bleed into December. ","We went from kind of sluggish, to better, to strong -- in terms of sales. So as you see things firm up, there's a little bit less incentives and a little bit more price. Construction costs have been moving up at the same pace. We feel pretty comfortable as we look at our numbers, as we look at our backlog right now, that our margin is coming back up. Rick? ","Rick Beckwitt","Yes, I guess the thing I'd say to add to that, Stephen, is we're spot on with where we thought we would be for the quarter with regard to gross margins. ","Stephen East","Okay. ","Rick Beckwitt","I think that the analyst community put too much margin in the first half of the year than in the back half of the year. We're on the trajectory to get to where we guided to. With regard to WCI, as Bruce said, it'll have about a 20 to 30 basis point impact in Q2. But given the fact that WCI had a low cost land position with high gross margins, it will not negatively impact margins for this year on an annualized basis. ","Operator","Our next question comes from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is now open. ","John Lovallo","First question would be the year-over-year decline in backlog conversion in the west. How much of that was due to weather and can you quantify potentially the impact on ASP and on potentially gross margin? ","Jon Jaffe","This is Jon. For the most part, it was due to the weather. More impacted in terms of starts than the closings, but there were markets where it was impact as well. We couldn't complete landscaping which prevented us from getting COOs, as an example. ","I think that we will make up the majority of that. It will push towards the back of the year and a little of it will slide into where multi-family type of for-sale product in the Bay Area, as an example. There's condominiums. That might push out beyond the year. But I don't think that we'll see any impact to our margins from those weather impacts and delays, just some timing issues. ","John Lovallo","Okay. That's helpful. And then, in the central division, it looks like orders were actually down slightly on a year-over-year basis. Can you maybe give us a little color around that? ","Stuart Miller","I think some of that is driven by the impact of still, a little bit of sluggishness in Houston, but with regard to Houston, we have seen a pick up. We're starting to see a little of an increase in rig count and we still have a divergence in sales pace between the higher priced and the lower priced ones. So, Houston was a little soft, but it looks like it's, the picture is getting a little brighter there as we move through the year. ","Jon Jaffe","As we look at that -- this is Jon -- we strategically reduced our community count in Houston which brought the total community count in the central region down a little bit year-over-year and our sales pace was actually just up a tick year-over-year, so I think it's pretty steady there and we're managing our portfolio of communities adjusting it to the market conditions. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. ","Michael Rehaut","First question I just had, Stuart, I wanted to go back to some of your opening remarks about sales pace being better than expected and referring to some optimism in the marketplace and you mentioned that the sales pace, when we look about sales pace, excuse me, we calculate if you strip out WCI, that sales pace was up about 7% year-over-year. ","That's versus roughly 5%, 5.5% in 4Q, 5% in 3Q. So, definitely a touch better, but I was interested, if the sales pace increased materially throughout the quarter, during the quarter. Obviously, you also have your typical spring selling season pick up. But on a year-over-year basis, if the sales pace increased materially or, given that 7% is a little better than 5%, just wanted to know if there's any other kind of metrics that is driving that commentary. ","Stuart Miller","Okay, so, I'm not really sure where you get your 7%, but let's put that aside and let's understand where my commentary comes from. Remember that when we're looking at our monthly year-over-year, we're looking at comparison to last year. So, let's take seasonality out of the equation because we're looking at December to December, January to January, February to February, so the seasonality is injected at both sides. ","And what we were seeing in terms of the numbers is a slower and lower comparison in December, a comparable comparison in January and a substantially higher comparison in February. So that's the numerical side of the commentary. But the empirical side is what I look to dovetail with the number side, as I think about these things and I try to think about them in realtime and balance what we're hearing at the front line in the field from our customers and measure that up against what we're seeing in the numbers. ","And so the commentary really derives from the kind of traffic patterns, the questions that people are talking about and the kinds of people that are showing up. What we're starting to see -- I think in my commentary I noted that the millennials are doubled up at about a 60% rate living at home with parents, relatives or roommates. It's at 115 year high as reported in U.S.A Today. ","I don't know if that's exactly the right number, but it is directionally interesting and we're starting to see some of that cohort start to come out to our sale centers and talk about the fact that rental rates are high, rental rates have been moving, rental rates create some instability. It's time to start thinking about buying a home, 30-year mortgage, fixing the monthly payment and looking at the possibilities and benefits of actual ownership, dovetailing that with the banks talking about coming back to market. ","These are the components that kind of make up my sense that there's something afoot in the market that's broader than just one month in a row positive comparison. So that's kind of where it comes from, Mike. ","Michael Rehaut","That's perfect. And yes, definitely thinking about it in terms of year-over-year, so appreciate that. I guess, secondly, just on WCI and obviously, congrats on the closing of that transaction and it looks like you're going to extract a lot of value there. I was interested, you mentioned that there's a low cost basis there and attractive margins. ","At the same time, you're going to have the typical purchase accounting impact on 2Q, but once you work through that, from my understanding, purchase accounting typically does impact what's the overall lot position as well and I was just curious to get a sense maybe, Bruce, if you want to throw out some -- opine here or talk about what's been able to be worked through or worked out from an accounting perspective? ","How should we think about the gross margins from WCI because, typically, from my understanding, those are written up as well. I don't know if there was different nuances or idiosyncrasies with this particular acquisition. ","Stuart Miller","Well, what I would say, Mike, is that, as we go through the purchases accounting exercise, we look at all the various assets and the assets will be, let's just to use an estimate, be somewhere close to the margins that we get within that marketplace where the assets are. So as we're performing at a certain level, we would expect the assets in that same market to be somewhere close. ","So, the real purchase accounting impact is really in the second quarter as we write up backlog and then as you get beyond the second quarter, for the most part, the integration costs, the write up of backlog is all behind us, we expect. And then for the second half of the year and beyond, you get back to more normal type of margins that we would expect in that market place and that's probably the best way to think about it. ","Michael Rehaut","Are margins in your home Florida market above corporate average? ","Stuart Miller","They are just a little bit ahead of the Company average. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is now open. ","Jade Rahmani","You mentioned WCI should be accretive for the full year 2017, primarily in the second half, so wanted to see if you could provide any commentary, a bit high level, regarding 2018. Should the main areas of potential further improvement from that acquisition come through the SG&A leverage and financial services? ","Rick Beckwitt","Yes, this is Rick. We haven't really given any 2018 guidance, but you could expect from my comments earlier that we will get SG&A leverage, you will see a benefit to some gross margin because of lower costs and operating efficiencies and as we move into the tail end of this year, we'll give guidance for 2018. ","Jade Rahmani","And on the financial services side, can you just provide further color on what drove the uptick in title? Any changes into how you're marketing the product or any additional services you're offering home buyers? ","Bruce Gross","I could take that. We have a little static in the background, but, Jade, titles, first quarter is typically the lowest quarter of the year, so that increase is on a very low base and, essentially, we just had some additional pricing in terms of the average sales price of the transactions we had during the quarter were higher on the same overhead base, so we got additional leverage. So, percentage wise, it looked really good, but nominally, it was really just a small increase. ","Stuart Miller","Okay, so with that, let me say thank you to everybody for joining us. We feel really good about how our Company is positioned and how the year is starting to shape up. We think that the overall environment is strong and we look forward to reporting back to you as we go through the rest of the year. Thank you. ","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

Miller","Okay, very good. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2013 update. We're very pleased to share our results to you this morning. We are here in our Southern California office, as we're here to host our Board of Directors meeting, and to have our board spend some time with our California management team and to see some of our product out here as well.","In the context of our board meeting, let me take this opportunity to welcome our newest board member, Teri McClure. Teri brings a tremendous amount of background and experience to our board, as she is General Counsel for UPS, and you can read more about Teri's experience and history in the press release that we put out this morning.","Now this morning, I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you've just heard from, who's our Controller; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto, are here as well for our Q&A session.","I'd like to begin this morning with some brief overview remarks on the overall state of the housing market recovery in the context of today's volatile market conditions, and then briefly overview our operations. Bruce, then, is going to, as usual, provide greater detail on our overall numbers, as well as some further comments on our Financial Services segment. And then as always, we'll open up for Q&A. As we have in the past, we request that during Q&A, each person limit themselves to one question and just one related follow-up.","So let me begin. And to begin, let me state the obvious. Interest rates have moved higher and mortgage rates have moved from their unprecedented low point towards more normalized levels. And while this movement is not a surprise, given the improvement in economic conditions and in the housing market in general, it seems that the timing has caught the investor community off-guard and has shaken investor confidence in the overall housing recovery. Our view, though, is that the housing recovery is still very much intact and that the fundamentals of that recovery remain solid.","The overriding driver of recovery in the housing market remains the underproduction of both single and multifamily product throughout the economic downturn and up to and including this year. Over the past 5 years of housing production, we've built an average of under 700,000 single and multifamily homes total per year, with an average obsolescence rate of approximately 300,000 per year. This compares to a need for new dwelling units per year of between 1.2 million and 1.5 million.","This year, a significantly stronger year of building activity, we will produce approximately 950,000 single and multifamily dwellings, and again, will underserve the country's needs. We have more than absorbed the overbuilding of the early to mid-2000s, and have been underproducing for a protracted period of time. This shortfall will have to be made up, and the builders of both multi and single-family products have been pushing to increase production.","The increase in production has been slow and difficult because of 2 factors. First, there's a shortage of entitled and developed land to build on and land prices have been moving higher. Secondly, the increased production has created labor shortages in many major markets. We hear of the labor shortage not just from the builders in the field, but also from the manufacturers and distributors that serve the industry. While these shortages add to the cost to build in the short term, they also fuel the longer-term prospects for housing, as employment drives confidence and the wage increases that lure workers off the sofa and back into the field to meet demand also enable more families to afford to purchase or rent.","While production continues to lag the need, we are experiencing supply shortages against a growing demand. While some have argued that increased demand is being driven by low interest rates, we believe that it's being driven by a generally improving economy, driving household formation and a decoupling of households under one roof. New families are seeking to find independent shelter. Where attractive financing is available and obtainable, households seek for-sale product. But in the absence of a for-sale option, they seek rentals. But that just increases demand for rentals and drives up the rental rates, making for-sale monthly payments even more attractive. The bottom line is that there are too few dwellings for a growing population and for normalized household formation.","Inventories are low for both new and existing homes, as well as for rentals. As demand increases, there are fewer homes or apartments to purchase or rent, and prices are being driven higher, as you can see in today's Case-Shiller results and today's new home sales beat.","Distressed homes are being absorbed by the investor community and repurposed as rentals. In the short term, these rentals are helping to fill the void of the short supply of rentals for growing demand. The relationship between rental rates and for-sale monthly payments has favored homeownership for some time now. Even with interest rates edging upward to more normalized levels, the monthly payment math continues to push families to find a way to purchase, in order to lower their monthly payment, to increase their disposable income, and to stabilize their living expenses without annual repricing.","And interest rates, though modestly higher, are still at historically low levels. Customer perception at this point remains that today's low interest rate still presents a unique opportunity to lock in a very low cost of capital, and this opportunity might not be available forever.","At current interest rates, affordability remains at historically very high levels. Even with more significant movement in both interest rate and pricing, homes remain affordable by all measures, and will continue to remain attractive relative to rental options as well.","Finally, while demand for homes has been constrained by an overly-restrictive mortgage market, which has limited access to homeownership with highly conservative underwriting criteria, the landscape is improving, as lenders are beginning to reconsider their credit underwriting overlays and open the doors for more -- to more approvals. While this process has been and continues to be slow to mature, we've come a long way since last year at this time, and we expect to see further easing of credit standards to normalized levels and further extension of credit to the market.","As we've seen in the past week, there have been, and still are, economic and political uncertainties ahead that will affect and bring questions to the future of housing. We continue to feel that this housing recovery is fundamentally based and driven by a long-term demographic need for dwelling units. We believe we're still in the beginning stages of a recovery that will be sustained for several more years.","Now turning to Lennar. Lennar has been, and continues to be, very well-positioned for recovery in housing. This is reflected in our second quarter 2013 results and in our positioning for the future. In our second quarter, new orders were up 27% over last year, and our dollar value of backlog is up over 76%, to its highest level in 5 years. Gross margins improved year-over-year to an industry-leading 24.1%, a 160-basis-point increase over last year. And operating margins increased 410 basis points to 13.3%, reflecting the powerful operating leverage in our absorption rate growth. For the full year 2013, we expect our average gross margin to continue to improve throughout the year.","Margins continue to benefit from our aggressive land acquisition strategy, as well as higher home prices, lower incentives and operating leverage from greater absorption per community of approximately 4 per month now, which is a significant improvement over last year, and then, of course, from more sales as well.","During the quarter, we continued our aggressive land acquisition program and closed on approximately 8,700 homesites for $450 million, and that land had basically been contracted between 1 and 2 years prior to its closing. Additionally, we spent approximately $122 million on bringing land to developed status, ready for production. Combined, our land acquisition and land spend is up about 100% year-over-year.","Our average selling price for the second quarter was $282,500, a 13% increase over last year, which covered the increases in labor and material costs, and increased -- which increased approximately 8% over the prior year. Our Homebuilding operations have been improving due to a strong operating strategy, complemented by an excellent management team and management execution.","Additionally, we opened 93 new communities and closed out 83 communities during the quarter, to end at 9 -- 492 active communities, a 12% year-over-year increase. Today, we are fortunate to have the land in-hand to meet our projected deliveries through 2014 and as a result, we're pursuing land opportunities for 2015 and beyond.","This is an enviable position in today's market, and is a position that was earned through our very strategic land acquisition program that began back in 2009.","Complementing our Homebuilding operations, our Financial Services segment had another strong quarter, with operating earnings of $29 million compared to $18 million last year. Our mortgage company captured some 79% of Lennar homebuyers within the markets in which it operates.","Mortgage operations have also benefited from a robust refinancing market, which of course, is now starting to subside. Lennar home mortgages should continue to grow alongside our expanding Homebuilding business, as well as serve non-Lennar purchasers in a growing number of markets.","While our Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our 3 additional operating divisions are all maturing to be excellent longer-term value-creation platforms for the company. Rialto continues to grow as a blue-chip capital investment management company and commercial real estate capital provider. While current earnings have slowed as we have shifted from balance sheet investment to a fund investment model, the prospects for future consistent earnings continue to improve.","We have now invested or committed almost $1 billion of equity through Fund 1, and we are now harvesting those investments. Performance for the fund is already well ahead of original projections, and we started distributing capital back to investors and have returned almost 1\/2 of the original investment.","In addition, if we continue on our current performance path, we expect we will exceed the return hurdles set for our investors, which means that the carried interest to Rialto, as the manager of the fund, will exceed our expectations, and none of that potential value is reflected in our current earnings picture.","Finally, in December, Fund #2 had its first closing of commitments of approximately $260 million, including $100 million from us. And in the second quarter, we closed an additional $260 million to bring the total in Fund 2 to $520 million closed, which is about halfway to our total goal. And we have already started investing that capital as well.","Although the shorter-term earnings have slowed, we have morphed to a private equity program and our Rialto program is maturing. We are very excited about the long-term prospects for value creation from this program.","Lennar multifamily, our apartment division, has now commenced construction on 5 apartment communities nationwide, totaling approximately 1,500 apartments and $225 million in development. And it's moving forward with a growing pipeline. We expect that rental will continue to thrive alongside the for-sale market, as many will not be able to access the for-sale market and rentals will meet their housing needs. Even with the step-up in apartment production nationally, additional product will be needed to meet the demand to fill the shortfall from prior years.","Finally, FivePoint Communities is quickly moving to bring developed land in premium locations to the market, to fill the growing demand for well-located, approved and developed homesites. This quarter, we saw the first earnings contribution from this division, which will continue to contribute as additional land becomes entitled and developed over the next years.","In conclusion, while we are aware of the concerns that are being reflected in current market volatility, it is our belief that the market remains positioned to continue to recover, and that our company is exceptionally well-positioned to benefit. The housing market is healing and recovery is accelerating as we produce shelter that is needed for a growing population and a return to more normal levels of household formation.","As the housing market continues its overall trajectory back to normal, it is providing stimulus to the overall economy through job creation and building long-term consumer wealth, which, for generations, has been the benefit of homeownership.","Lennar's Homebuilding machine is extremely well-positioned and continues to gain market share. We have excellent land positions in all of our major markets, while the land market, overall, is very constrained, and we have an excellent management team that will continue to be our primary driver of current earnings.","Homebuilding, of course, is supported and enhanced by our Financial Services division, which will grow in step with the homebuilder and continue to develop its third-party operations to enhance its bottom line.","Rialto continues to expand its franchise and invest in high-yielding alternative investments, while supporting the homebuilder with access to off-market homesites. Our growing multifamily platform will continue to provide an additional long-term complementary growth opportunity for the company. And FivePoint, with its large long-term California land assets, could not be better positioned to reap the benefits of an appreciating land-constrained housing market.","Although there continue to be political and economic headline risks, the primary drivers of our business are fundamentally sound. I am confident of Lennar's position today in the marketplace, and rest assured that our future growth is supported by a strong balance sheet with an exceptional group of leaders, who will be able to navigate through the challenges and towards the opportunities that lie ahead.","With that, let me turn over to Bruce.","Bruce E. Gross","Thank you, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $0.61 per diluted share. If we excluded the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance in both years, and normalized the tax rate at 39%, the EPS comparison per diluted share would be $0.43 for the quarter versus $0.15 in the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 58% in the second quarter, driven by a 39% increase in deliveries and a 13% year-over-year increase in ASP to $283,000.","The average sales price by region is as follows: East region, $263,000, up 14%; Southeast Florida, $273,000, up 3%; Central, $257,000, up 12%; Houston, $253,000, up 10%; West Region, $321,000, up 5%; Other, $399,000, up 25%.","The gross margins from our new communities purchased after 2008 continued to outperform the company average gross margin during the quarter, and they represented approximately 59% of the company's deliveries in Q2. Sales incentives were $20,200 per home delivered during the quarter, or 6.7% of home sales revenue. The sales incentives improved by 400 basis points or $9,600 per home delivered versus the prior year. The gross margin percentage for the quarter was highest in the East, Southeast Florida and West regions.","Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues from home sales, improved 230 basis points to 10.9%. And this is the incremental operating leverage that we've been discussing, primarily as our volume, and particularly, our absorption per community has been increasing. Again, our absorption per community this quarter was 4 sales per community per month. That's an increase over last year's 3.5 per community per month, and 2.9 in the first quarter of this year. This was the lowest SG&A percentage, as a percent of home sales, in the last 7 years.","During the quarter, Stuart mentioned the El Toro joint venture sold their first homesites to homebuilders, including Lennar. Our 25% interest in the joint venture resulted in a $13 million profit on our joint venture line. Lennar purchased 3 of these communities that were sold by the venture, and the profit relating to the communities purchased by Lennar are deferred and recognized in our gross margin at the time that Lennar delivers the homes, which we expect to start in fiscal 2014.","Turning to Financial Services. The second quarter improvement was again helped by the strong refinance environment, leading to higher volumes and higher profit per transaction. The mortgage pretax income increased to $26.1 million from $17.2 million in the prior year. This quarter's mortgage originations increased by 45% to $1.4 billion.","Originations with non-Lennar homebuyers were 51% of the total originations this quarter. And again, that was helped out by the increase in the number of refinance transactions.","Our title company had a good quarter as well. They had a $3.7 million profit during the quarter compared with $1.4 million in the prior year.","Our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings totaling $2.8 million, compared to $4.3 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest.","The composition of Rialto's $2.8 million of operating earnings by type of investment is as follows: the Rialto real estate funds contributed $4.4 million of earnings; the FDIC and wholly-owned bank portfolios contributed a net of $4.5 million of earnings; and these amounts were reduced by $6.1 million of G&A and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $9 million. The prior year amount included $2.7 million of earnings from PPIP, which was successfully completed in the prior year. At quarter end, the FDIC debt net of cash available in the defeasance [ph] account and in Rialto's cash account was down to $48 million. We expect this debt to be paid off around year end, and then there will be more significant cash flow generated back to the parent.","During the quarter, we reversed approximately $41 million of the remaining tax asset reserve, all of which pertains to state taxes. This was the remaining reserve we expected to reverse this year, and going forward, we expect an effective rate of 39%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet liquidity remained strong in the quarter, at $728 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. In June, this facility was increased to $950 million, and the maturity extended to June of 2017. During the quarter, we issued an additional $50 million to our $525 million of 4.750% notes due 2022. And in the last 4 quarters, we have now issued a total of $1.2 billion of long-term senior notes, with an average coupon of 4.6%.","I wanted to summarize what was said on this call and highlight a few items, additionally, for the remainder of 2013. Number one, we have noted an increase in our cycle time and have generated a high percentage of pre-sales during the spring selling season, and as a result, we expect our backlog conversion ratio to be between 75% and 80% for the third quarter. Although the backlog conversion is declining in the third quarter, we are well-positioned with our backlog and expect to deliver between 18,250 and 18,500 homes for all of 2013.","As Stuart highlighted, our gross margin is increasing throughout the year. And with the strength of our backlog, it gives us confidence to increase our gross margin guidance to approximately 24.25% for Q3 and 24.75% for Q4.","For a couple of quarters, we have highlighted that we expect the number of refinanced transactions will slow as we progress through the year, and the profit per transaction in our mortgage business is likely to moderate a little bit. Additionally, we are required to book profit on our mortgage originations at the time that we lock the loan. As a result, the profit for Financial Services is higher in the spring selling season, and we expect that profit in Financial Services will be sequentially lower, both in Q3 and Q4. As highlighted on the call, Rialto is in a transitional year, and we expect Rialto's profitability to continue to be backloaded to the fourth quarter of 2013.","With that, let me open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, LLC","It's actually Alan on for Ivy. The first question I had just relates to kind of your stock performance year-to-date, which has underperformed despite, obviously, the very strong performance in your Homebuilding business. And we've heard from some clients just general concerns or questions about your expansion into some of the other ancillary businesses, such as apartments and obviously, the Rialto business, which the profitability has declined here a little bit. I was hoping you might be able to just put the rising rates -- put some perspective behind that on the impact on those ancillary pieces of your business, and obviously, in Rialto specifically, given the high-yield investments there, if you would expect to see any impact on future profitability from higher rates?","Stuart A. Miller","Wow. That's a lot of questions in one, Alan. But let me see if I can attack that. First of all, as it relates to stock performance, as a management team, we're highly focused on operational performance in the company, and the investor community is going to have to interpret things as they might. We, of course, have pretty much gotten out ahead of the rest of the market in terms of land acquisition and -- okay, so let me just continue. So we've gotten out ahead in terms of land acquisition and margin enhancement, and we've had pretty strong margin growth early on in the recovery cycle. So we've enjoyed, I think, a pretty good program relative to our position within the industry and our stock price as well. Perhaps that subsides it [ph] a little bit. I'm not really sure and, of course, interest rates have kind of altered the landscape for the entire industry, at least over the short term. As it relates to our fundamental business, we've said consistently, our primary driver is and continues to be our Homebuilding operation. We are extremely well-positioned from a land standpoint. We're well-positioned in terms of margin generation, and our management team really is hitting on all cylinders. With that said, our ancillary businesses are really well-positioned for future growth and for future contribution. Frankly, I have not been more excited than I am today about the prospects for Rialto, and as well, the prospects for our multifamily, even given the increase in interest rate that we've seen and the changing environment. Rialto has morphed from an on-balance sheet to a private equity model. In doing so, you're seeing fewer earnings flow through to the bottom line right now. That will change over time as our press starts to be brought into earnings in the future. But as it relates to our Fund 1 performance, it has been nothing short of exceptional, and Fund 2, monies are already starting to be invested. We are providing capital for commercial real estate financings and other positions within capital stack [ph] . We think that this is business is going to continue to grow, and is going to be a very exciting part of our story going forward. As far as the rental apartment properties division is concerned, we have a growing pipeline, growing from $1.5 billion to $2 billion in properties that are going to be coming online. As I noted in my opening comments, we have 5 properties under construction. And I think in the context of a market that is short on dwelling units overall, people are going to be looking to purchase because the monthly payment is lower, if you're able to purchase. But if not, there's a growing demand for rentals, and we think that rental rates are going to continue to be pushed up higher. So even with interest rates going up, we feel pretty comfortable about the rental community development as well.","Richard Beckwitt","I guess the only thing I'd add, too, is all the time we've been expensing startup costs associated with these businesses and our pretax income has doubled on a year-over-year basis, and our margins are up on a year-over-year basis. So I think we've been a good steward of the capital.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay, Rick, I appreciate that, and sorry I jumped on late. You guys couldn't hear me, I was muted. But I think that Stuart, as the most senior tenured leader of the industry, I think people would really appreciate maybe a little bit more specifics on your view of the backup in rates. I know you said that -- you commented that we have a lot of room to go. But what rate starts to get you nervous? And I recognize you can't really think about rates in isolation, so can you give us your more elaborate sort of expectations on what really starts to make a difference from the consumers' affordability?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, Ivy, the first thing that I'd say is that rates have been at historically low levels. They're reverting, and maybe they're actually starting a movement, or maybe it will ebb and flow a little bit. But they're going to ultimately revert to more normalized levels. Now, but you can't look at the interest rate in isolation. We have to be looking at interest rate in the context in which they're moving, which means an improving economy, an improving employment picture. We are seeing labor shortages across the country, not just for the homebuilders and people in the field, but for manufacturers and distributors. We're hearing from all of those people that, not only are there labor shortages, but wages are moving up in order to get people off the sofa and back into the field. And this portends good things for demand for housing, both on the for-sale and the rental side. Interest rates that are moving higher in the context of economic improvement, employment improvement, at the same time, really reflects a healthy economy and a healthy movement. And for housing, in general, has historically meant that housing is going to thrive, as more people are able to afford to buy or to rent and to match-up with the supply that is available. And of course, right now, we're looking at a supply shortage, so that means that even in the context of rising rates and a better economy, we're likely to see price increases and rental increases as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Jade Rahmani of KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask on Homebuilding SG&A. I think last quarter, you provided some sequential comparisons and expectations for the rest of the year. I think given the step function down this quarter, would you be comfortable providing any expectations for the rest of this year on that line item?","Bruce E. Gross","Sure, Jade. This is Bruce. I think as you look at the next quarter, I would expect a similar type of SG&A percentage as we had this quarter, and a little bit more leverage as we go into the fourth quarter, as we expect to have more deliveries in Q4. So we'll see what that percentage is. But figure flat next quarter, and a little bit of improvement going into Q4.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Regarding Rialto, is there a way we can think about the value of the carried interest benefit that you could receive? And have your -- are your comments meant to suggest that this could be a 4Q event? Or would that be next year?","Stuart A. Miller","I think I'd be looking to next year, and we haven't given guidance on the magnitude of the carried interest. But we are becoming more enthusiastic about our prospects in all of our fund investing. And I think that we'll have to ask for you to be patient, until we have better clarity to bring to the market.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And finally, the pick up or the -- reportedly Rialto has begun conduit operations or is in talks regarding that, I think you alluded to that in your commentary. Should we expect all of those lending programs to flow through the private equity funds rather than through the wholly-owned subsidiary earnings?","Stuart A. Miller","A lot of the capital activities will be wholly-owned. So it will be -- some of that will be split between the private equity and the on-balance sheet. But the operations that are kind of the natural evolution of that business, the conduit activities, the origination side, is generally on-balance sheet. The purchase of securities and special servicing is going to flow more through the private equity, so it's kind of split.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I had a couple of questions for you. One, I guess the question we're getting a lot from investors relates to the impact of rising interest rates on your business and obviously, you've done a good job here of addressing the fact that you really haven't seen that yet. Implicitly, it would seem that if you have not -- if you're not anticipating seeing, let's say, a 100 basis-point rise that we've almost absorbed, affecting demand, implicitly what you're saying is that the buyers who have been buying over the last year have not been maximizing their purchase -- purchasing power and therefore, are able to absorb somewhat higher rates, and still make a decision to buy, essentially, the same unit and the same price that they would have bought, let's say, 6 months ago or prior to the higher rates. My observation is that that's probably true because the lending standards are much more difficult right now, and so if you can actually get a mortgage, you're probably a solid-enough citizen with a solid-enough balance sheet that you're probably being relatively prudent. But I'd love to hear your particular view on whether or not your buyer, over the last 6 months, has been able to buy more than they have been buying and therefore, can tolerate a higher rate environment?","Richard Beckwitt","It's Rick. As we were coming out of the downturn and people were trying to get a sense of footing of where the economy was going, I think they didn't put everything they could into the home. They left a little bit on the table. They wanted to feel and see the economy improving. And we've seen, over the last 12 months, incremental changes in the type of spec level that we've been putting in our homes, given the fact that people have a little bit more appetite and purchasing power today than they had a year ago. But the other thing that sometimes gets skewed as you look at it from a lofty level, is that it's a different mix of buyers every day out there. And while we try to draw some comparisons on a trend line, it's real difficult to do because you have different groups of people, different products at any point in time that are for sale. But generally speaking, you're correct. There is increased purchasing power today, notwithstanding the fact that people had that muscle before.","Stuart A. Miller","Let me just add to that and say that there are a lot of different stories out there. I think in part, there has been a more conservative approach to using all of the buying power, as Rick just described. But additionally, this decoupling that is going on, people having been 2 generations under one roof during the downturn, and unwinding that has really enabled the generation that's moving out and finding its own new shelter to save money, to reposition their credit, and to be positioned to be able to purchase. That new entrant into the marketplace, or reentrant into the marketplace, as the case may be, is positioned to be able to make a lot of choices because they've saved some money and they've gotten their credit history in good position to be able to afford something. And the important thing right now, Steve, is the relationship between monthly payments in for-sale relative to monthly payments for rent, is really a driver and very compelling for people to find a way to afford as much as possible on the for-sale side.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. That's very helpful. My second question relates to your land spend activity. I think you did a good job of talking about the fact that you have a very strong land pipeline, and you've done a lot of things when times were bad, so that you don't really have to force anything now that times are getting better. I wanted to ask you, though, if you could help us understand what you would likely do differently in the near term, if, over the course of the next few months, God forbid, you did see something happening out in the field that was markedly worse, if the environment got markedly worse and you saw that in your selling communities, what would be the likely response in terms of your land spend activity? And I'm really trying to frame sort of how much of your land spend, that you've been doing and that you're expecting to do here over the remainder of the year, is for communities that you don't really need, in other words, like 2015, 2016 versus stuff that you actually kind of need to open in various markets in the next year or 2?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, Steve, It's Rick. As we've shared with you before, and Steve -- and Stuart highlighted on the call earlier, we've been way ahead here. I can tell you that while we're continuing to look for opportunities where we can feather in some things for the balance of 2013 if they fall in our lap, or early 2014, mid-2014, the lion's share of what we're looking for is 2015 and 2016. So with that said, a dramatic shift in the land environment, for us, would possibly be a good thing because it would create some turmoil out there in the market. From a general perspective, as we're looking at those type of opportunities, given the long runway that has to happen through entitlement or processing, and zoning, and those type of things, the values for those assets are still incredibly wholesale opportunities. So we probably wouldn't approach it in a different way, we might be a little bit more cautious. But given that's where we're looking, it wouldn't dramatically change what we're doing.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Are you buying those or are you optioning those kinds of properties out to 2015 and '16?","Richard Beckwitt","More often than not, what we're doing is we're working with the owner of the land, putting it under contract, giving them a small amount of earnest money, and helping them with the entitlement process by using our intellectual capital and expertise with the cities as currency.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen East of ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I don't know if this is for Stuart or Rick. But if you look at your markets, when you think about higher rates and lower affordability, what would be the top 2 or 3 markets that you think are most susceptible to having problems with the higher rates? And which markets do you think would be in the best shape?","Stuart A. Miller","I think, Stephen, pretty much across-the-board, affordability right now is at a place where the markets are going to -- look, we all recognize that there isn't a national housing market and each market is local and unique unto itself. But I think that affordability is in such a comfortable place right now, that when you ask about market susceptibility to interest rate movement, if you're in a range of moderate increases in interest rates, as we have seen, I think that all markets, pretty much across-the-board, are going to continue to be reasonably strong. So I wouldn't differentiate the markets unless you saw some kind of violent move in interest rates, which I'm just not projecting at this point.","Richard Beckwitt","Steve, it's Rick. I think it's more of a price-point issue as opposed to a market issue. I think when you get down into that sub-120 price point, if there is interest rate moves or confidence issues, then that business starts to get a little bit more difficult. Similarly, although most people would say that at the high-end of the market, those buyers don't necessarily need a mortgage, they're sophisticated buyers and they're getting one. And a movement in interest rate tends to, after time, affect the very high end. Given the fact that we're a first-time, move-up, middle-market, and some of our things are sort of second-time move-up, we think that we're pretty well insulated, to a large degree, from interest rate movements in the market.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful to me. And then if you look at El Toro, you had some nice community sales this quarter. As we look out over the next -- the rest of this year and '14, can you talk about -- give us some timelines so we can understand how we sort of forecast these businesses unwinding, not only El Toro, but some of your other parcels that you have in California?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Yes, Stephen, it's Jon. El Toro should see its next delivery homesites in 2014, about a year out from this first group that was just delivered. It would be a similar size, perhaps a little bit larger. What we just closed recently was about 725 homesites, and you should see an offering about once a year coming out of El Toro. In San Francisco, we just broke ground this month at Hunters Point, with product -- that product is being built within the venture, and you should see actual home deliveries from that in about 14 to 18 months.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","All right. And just one last question, you talked about 59% of your delivery sort of from your new communities. Can you remind us what the differential was on gross margin? And whether you're still seeing that consistency, new versus old legacy land?","Bruce E. Gross","Sure, Steve, it's Bruce. We're still seeing approximately 200-basis-point increase in gross margins from the new communities we've purchased since 2008. Now the legacy communities are still doing well from a gross margin perspective, but the new communities are about 200 bps higher.","Operator","Our next question is from David Goldberg of UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up actually on Stephen East's question and Rick's response, which I thought was a really interesting and good response on the buyer segment and price point, and how rates affect different buyer segments. And I'm going to ask a question, I don't know if it's answerable, but I'll give it my best shot, which is, when you think about that sub-120 price point, how important is that to the overall recovery of the housing market long-term when we think about past peaks and we think about getting margins -- excuse me, volumes back to starts, or new home sales back to where we were? And how important was that for Lennar in the last cycle? And kind of how important do you envision it as you go through this cycle?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, as far as how important it is for the industry, I think it's a function of 2 things. One is what employment growth is going to be, to a large degree, people buying that -- and whether it's sub-120, I used that as a number, it could be sub-110, that's probably a better number. There's people that buy. I think it has more of an impact on the resale market than on the new home market, because people will be not able to buy some of that product because there is less of a new construction market in that sub-120, 110 market. We're not really in that market except for a couple of divisions that offer some product like that. Bruce, you want -- or Stuart, talk about how this affected Lennar in the past cycles?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","This is Jon. As Rick said, our -- primarily, what we're delivering is in the middle market. So as you're dealing with those people who are just trying to enter the market for the first time, that really didn't have a big impact on our business. And as you look at markets like California, which tend to do very well on the upswing, the big price movements, you're not in that price point anyway, even in the Central Valley. You're starting in the mid-2s to $300,000 price points.","Richard Beckwitt","And David, one other thing I'd say is this may be a different set of cards this time. And the reason I'd say that is there was such deferred purchasing. You're seeing an older group of first-time buyers coming into the market that may have double income associated with that. So I'm not sure you can truly draw parallels to what happened in the past, although I'm sure that someone can.","Stuart A. Miller","I just want to say, David, I think you might have gotten it right in the beginning when you said this question might not be answerable. I think at the end of the day, this is a new environment. We're going to have to wait and see how it unfolds in terms of -- every part of the market kind of interacts with other parts of the market. The move-up buyer historically has been selling a home to a first-time buyer in order to move up. Right now, the move-up buyer is coming out of mom and dad's home or a coupled environment. So we have a new evolution this time around. I think that one of the other defining components of this particular market recovery is the fact that we are dealing with a housing shortage overall, both on the rental side and on the single-family side. And so some that might be move-ups have to look at rentals, but rental rate is high, so instead they go for something that's smaller in nature and more affordable. It's going to be interesting to see how it evolves, and I don't think there's a clear answer.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just one other quick question. Stuart, you mentioned in the prepared comments that you're seeing some easing on the credit standards side. Maybe you can talk about is that additional liquidity, more players, some of the more traditional, big correspondent lenders coming back to the market? Is it actually showing up in standards? Or is it just additional liquidity that you're seeing coming back?","Stuart A. Miller","I was watching CNBC as the CEO of LendingTree was talking yesterday, and I watched him struggle with some of the same questions. It's hard to put your finger on exactly where the loosening is taking place. I don't know if the customer is coming to the table better prepared with more down payment and more documentation, or if it's the lenders that are really opening the doors a little bit. But it's at the margins, and it's hard to identify exactly where the loosening is taking place, but it is. More people are getting approved, more people are finding their way to mortgage approval, and I think it's a trend that we're going to continue to see. Appraisals are clearly loosening up as part of the process as well. So I think the important thing to do is to look backwards a year or 1.5 years. And if you look backwards, you see we've come quite a long way in terms of people finding access to the mortgage markets. I think, as we look to next week and next month, it's hard to see where those incremental moves are going to come from. But I think a year from now, we're going to continue to see loosening and reversion to normal underwriting standards as markets, the financial markets, governmental markets, become more and more comfortable with an improving and recovering housing market overall. I think the overlays are just going to dissipate very -- at the margins.","Bruce E. Gross","One other thing I'd add to that, David, is one area that we are seeing some improvement is with the mortgage insurers. So there's a greater percentage of mortgage insurers coming back in, and that's allowing somebody that previously was going for a 20% down with a conventional mortgage, you're now seeing the ability to have lower down payments, and we see that that's likely to increase even further as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Desi DiPierro of RBC.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On the labor and material side, you said it was up 8% in the quarter. In recent months, have you seen in a slowdown in the rate of increase, or even a decline in material prices, given lower lumber and OSB prices?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","This is Jon. For example, lumber has just come down recently, but the way that the pricing works is that will affect our starts in this quarter and our deliveries into the fourth quarter and first quarter. So you'll see a trend up until those deliveries hit. Other products have been relatively flat. Of course, some commodities are down, like copper. So on one side, you have pressure from labor, that's pushing cost up. And then on the materials side, things tend to be plus or minus flat, with the exception of lumber, as I just mentioned, which came down for panels about 25% and dimensional lumber about 15%.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then just looking at Financial Services, I know you said that operating income would be lower sequentially due to the seasonality. And so I also wanted to see if you, in addition to lower volumes, are you seeing a change in the spread on the mortgages that you're originating when you go to sell them as well, given the results [ph] ?","Bruce E. Gross","Sure. Spreads have been at high levels compared to historical norms. So we're expecting that, that will be the case as we go into the second half of this year. We haven't seen a lot of that yet, but the expectation should be that, that will be moderate as we go through the rest of 2013.","Operator","That is all the time we have for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Stuart for closing remarks.","Stuart A. Miller","Okay. Well listen, thanks, everyone, for joining us. As you can see, we're pretty enthusiastic about our positioning as it relates to the future, and we feel pretty strongly that the housing recovery is intact and likely to continue for some time to come. Thanks for joining us, and we'll report back at the end of next quarter.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart A. Miller","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter and year end 2013 update. We're very pleased to share our results with you this morning.","This morning, I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you've just heard from, who's our Controller; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto, are here as well for our question-and-answer session. And Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, is with us by telephone from California.","I'd like to begin this morning with some brief overview remarks on the overall state of the housing market and then briefly overview our operations. Bruce, as usual, will provide further detail on our overall numbers and some further comments on our Financial Services segment. And then we'll open up to question-and-answer. [Operator Instructions]","So let me begin. Over the past months, we've seen a pause in the rate of improvement in the recovery of the housing market as both volume and price appreciation have moderated in response to political turmoil and interest rate increases. We noted in our third quarter conference call that we were beginning to see signs of this moderation, but we believed then, and we continue to believe now, that the housing market remains on track for a solid recovery and is likely to continue to improve over an extended period of time.","We continue to believe that the overriding driver of recovery in the housing market remains the production deficit of both single- and multi-family dwellings throughout the economic downturn and up to and including this year. This shortfall will have to be made up, and the builders of both multi- and single-family products will need to increase production, as inventories have remained extremely low and pent-up demand comes on to the market. And even as the market responds, inventories are likely to remain constrained, as production increases are limited by a shortage of entitled and developed land to build on in desirable locations.","While we recognize the potential headwinds from recent moves to lower loan limits and raised guarantee fees on government-sponsored mortgages and the continued pressure on interest rates, we feel that the short supply of available homes and pent-up demand, along with a generally improving economy, will continue to drive the housing recovery forward. And we're anticipating a robust spring selling season, which historically begins just after the Super Bowl.","Our view, and the primary driver of our business strategy, is that the housing recovery is still very much intact and that the fundamentals of that recovery remain solid. Currently, we are seeing, in the field, traffic patterns that indicate that buyers are coming to the market and finding short supplies. While this time of the year is our seasonal slow -- seasonally slow time of year for actually closing sales, we are continuing to see healthy interest in the field, which indicates that the 2014 selling season will prove to be very healthy for those who are well positioned with well-located assets and product.","Against that backdrop, Lennar has finished up 2013 with a very solid fourth quarter and full year results that speak both to the solid management and execution of our articulated strategies and to the positioning of our company for performance in the future. Each of our businesses showed strong results for 2013, and we are well positioned for the future. As a company, we took advantage of the market cycle and, accordingly, we feel we have excellent asset positions to drive future growth.","Homebuilding, of course, remains our primary driver of quarterly performance. For the fourth quarter, revenues grew to $1.9 billion, up 42% over last year, as we continued to focus on maximizing our pricing power. Our sales pace in the fourth quarter averaged 2.9 sales per community per month, which was flat or just short of last year at 3 per month.","Our average sales price advanced to $307,000, which was a year-over-year increase of $46,000 or 18% and a 5.5% sequential increase from the third quarter. This improvement in sales prices covered increases in labor and material and the cost -- and land costs, as reflected in our gross margin.","The fourth quarter gross margin improved year-over-year to an industry-leading 26.8%, a 330-basis-point improvement, reflecting the strength of our well-positioned communities. With SG&A of 9.9%, a 140-basis-point year-over-year improvement, we continue to improve our operating leverage. An example of this focus is in our advertising spend, where, for the full year, we increased new orders 21% over 2012, but we spent less in nominal dollars than we did in 2012.","This operating leverage produced a 16.9% net operating margin for the quarter, which was a 490-basis-point improvement and close to peak quarterly operating margins. In our fourth quarter, new orders were up 13% over last year, while our new order dollar value of $1.4 billion was up 34% over the prior year, and our dollar value of backlog is up over 40%.","We opened 77 new communities and closed out 54 communities during the quarter to end at 3 -- 537 active communities, a 17% year-over-year increase. As expected, our backlog conversion ratio was 95% for the fourth quarter, and we expect Q1 to be between 80% and 85%.","Our fourth quarter performance highlights strong management execution but also indicates how well we are positioned for future performance. During the fourth quarter, we continued our carefully crafted land acquisition program and purchased approximately 11,000 homesites for $365 million, while we spent $197 million on land development. Combined, our land acquisition and land development spend was up about 76% over the prior year period.","As in prior quarters, money was invested geographically in the markets where we saw the best opportunities. In addition, we signed contracts to acquire approximately 3,000 homesites.","As we look ahead to 2014 and beyond, we feel fortunate to have the land in hand to meet our projected deliveries through 2014 and well into 2015, and this positions us well to maintain gross margins that are consistent with our reported full year 2013 25% growth. While recent sales have seen mild increases in the use of incentives on selected inventory, we expect that margins will continue to remain steady.","Over the past quarters, we've augmented our land strategy with the addition of shorter-turn, quicker -- shorter-term, quicker-turn purchases with high IRRs in order to continue to leverage our existing operating platform in 2014 and 2015. These are excellent deals for the company, even if they are at lower gross margins, because we can increase our operating margin, given that we already have the divisional fixed overhead covered for the next 2 years.","At November 30, 2013, we owned and controlled approximately 154,000 homesites. And, as I mentioned before, we had 537 active communities. In 2014, we expect to be able to increase community count by approximately 15% year-over-year. Overall, our homebuilding operations have improved and will continue to improve due to a strong operating strategy complemented by an excellent management team and management execution.","Complementing our homebuilding operations, our Financial Services segment had a very respectable quarter with operating earnings of $17 million, though down from the $33.2 million last year, when the refinancing business was booming. Our mortgage company captured some 75% of Lennar homebuyers within the markets in which we operate. While mortgage and title operations have benefited from a robust refinancing market in past quarters, that part of the business has now all but evaporated. Lennar home mortgage and title continue to grow, however, alongside our expanding Homebuilding business, as well as to serve a growing number of non-Lennar purchasers in a growing number of markets across the country.","While our Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our 3 additional operating divisions are all continuing to mature as excellent longer-term value creation platforms for the company.","Rialto has continued to grow as a blue chip capital investment management company and commercial real estate capital provider. While past quarter earnings slowed as we have shifted from a balance sheet investment company to a fund investment model, the current quarter results for Rialto demonstrate prospects for future consistent earnings. Almost 2\/3 of the almost $14 million pretax contribution from Rialto this quarter is a direct result of our new mortgage loan origination business. As we mentioned last quarter, earlier this year, we brought on board one of the industry's most experienced commercial real estate loan origination teams. The initial objective for Rialto Mortgage Finance has been to originate and securitize long-term fixed rate loans on stabilized cash-flowing, institutional-grade commercial real estate properties. By quarter end, we had successfully originated approximately $700 million of mortgage loans and completed 4 securitizations, generating over $23 million of gross profit.","This business has also been a perfect fit with our existing Rialto franchise, which already has been the market leader in CMBS B-piece investing and special servicing. In addition, now that the business is ramping up, we expect it will begin to generate more predictable and -- a more predictable and recurring component of earnings for Rialto and also begin generating excellent opportunities for our other investment vehicles and for us.","The rest of this quarter's contribution is from our previously existing real estate investment business. Our first real estate fund, in which we invested approximately $1 billion of private equity, including $75 million from us, continues to perform well above expectations. With next week's distribution, our investors will already have received back $420 million, representing 60% of their original equity commitments, in less than a year since we closed our final investment in the fund.","Our second real estate fund is also well on its way, finishing out its $1.3 billion equity raise this week. We far exceeded our $950 million fundraising goal, and Fund 2 has already invested or committed to invest approximately $600 million in 40 transactions. We are also continuing to raise our first mezzanine fund that is focused on investments in real estate loans that fall below -- just below the Fund 2 return threshold. We've already raised and invested a little less than 1\/3 of our targeted $300 million of equity. In addition, we are now managing a $200 million separate account for a major insurance company.","At this point in time, while we currently are paid fees and are reimbursed certain costs by our investors from these vehicles, our financial statements do not reflect any carried interest, as we don't recognize this component of income until it becomes due and payable.","Looking forward, we continue to see compelling opportunities in our core areas of expertise, including the continued clearing of distressed and sub-performing assets from financial institutions, providing the vital capital and management to reposition and refinance real estate assets as the markets continue to expand, and the growth of commercial real estate finance, where we've been a market leader in new B-piece investing and special servicing and, now, new loan origination and securitization.","As with Rialto, we are pleased with the progress of our multi-family apartment business. This business began operations in early 2011 and is positioned to be one of the leading developers of new Class A apartments in the United States. We've assembled a seasoned team of professionals across the country that is leveraging every aspect of our company.","In the fourth quarter, we commenced construction on 5 new apartment communities and now have 11 active communities and 1 completed community, totaling approximately 3,250 apartments with an estimated development cost of some $590 million. In addition to these communities, we have a geographically diversified development pipeline that exceeds $3 billion and represents over 12,500 additional rental apartments.","As we've discussed in the past, we're building these apartments with third-party institutional capital, and each deal has been conservatively financed with nonrecourse debt. In addition, we've underwritten our investment using today's rents and unlevered yield on cost that are 125 to 200 basis points over prevailing cap rates. With our conservative financing and underwriting, we're positioned to earn IRRs exceeding 25% and cash multiples greater than 2x.","We anticipate that the construction of our development pipeline will be completed over the next 4 years. And as a merchant builder of apartments, we plan to sell our apartments once rents and occupancies have stabilized. We should begin to see returns on invested capital by the middle of 2014 with a more meaningful contribution from our Multifamily segment in fiscal 2015.","Finally, our FivePoint Communities continues to mature as a long-term strategy as well and is quickly moving to bring developed land in premium California locations to market to fill the growing demand for well-located approved and developed homesites. In our second quarter, we saw our first earnings contribution from this division. We believe that FivePoint will create excellent long-term shareholder value for the company.","In conclusion, let me say that, while we are aware of the concerns that are being reflected in current market volatility, our company strategy continues to be driven by our belief that the market remains positioned to continue to recover and that our company is very well positioned to benefit. The housing market is healing, and we believe that the recovery is driven by shortage of available inventory, by pent-up demand and limited land available for building. While political and interest rate headwinds have tended to slow the recovery for the short term, our traffic patterns indicate to us that a generally improving economy will drive improved household formation and increased demand as we enter the 2014 selling season.","Lennar's homebuilding operation and asset base is extremely well positioned for the year ahead. We have excellent land positions in all of our major markets, while the overall land market is very constrained, and we have continued to fortify that position. Our Homebuilding and Financial Services operations will continue to be the company's primary driver of current earnings.","Our ancillary businesses of Rialto, Lennar Multifamily communities and FivePoint continue to mature and expand their franchises and will provide excellent longer-term opportunities to enhance shareholder value. We are very pleased with our progress and performance in 2013 and look forward to a very successful year ahead.","Thank you, and let me turn over to Bruce.","Bruce E. Gross","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. I'll add some color to the numbers that were in the press release today, starting with Homebuilding.","Our results reflected strong top line growth as our revenues from home sales increased 50% in the fourth quarter, driven by a 27% increase in deliveries and an 18% increase year-over-year in average sales price to $307,000. Let me give you some more details of that average sales price by region: the East region was $274,000, up 12%; Southeast Florida was up 13% to $299,000; Central region, $270,000, that was up 17%; Houston, $277,000, up 15%; the West region was up 31% to $407,000; and Other was $382,000, up 9%.","The gross margin on home sales that Stuart talked about, up 330 basis points to 26.8%, was driven by a couple of things. Primarily, sales incentives were $20,600 per home in the quarter, and that was an improvement of 270 basis points. It came down from 9% in the prior year to 6.3% in the current quarter. The gross margin percent improved in every one of our regions during the quarter and was highest in the East, Southeast Florida and West regions.","Our new communities purchased since 2009 continued their margin outperformance and represented approximately 2\/3 of the company's deliveries in the fourth quarter. The strong gross margin performance was partially offset by a 12% increase in labor and material cost to just under $47 per square foot. Sequentially, this is about a 3% increase from the third quarter. Labor costs were up a little bit more than material costs during the quarter. And we did benefit from the lower lumber cost earlier in the year that started to benefit our closings in the current quarter.","We do expect that there will be continued cost pressure in 2014 as the supply chain works to catch up to increased production levels. In addition to the significant operating margin leverage that Stuart commented on, we have additionally recognized operating leverage in our corporate G&A line, as our corporate G&A improved 60 basis points to 2.3% of total revenues, and that compared to 2.9% in the prior year. The other income net line totaled $13.3 million of profit during the quarter, and this was due to the sale of a rental operating property. This transaction resulted in a net loss of $3.2 million after including the reduction to the noncontrolling interest line of $17.6 million because this was a consolidating joint venture. This is not part of our new Multifamily operating segment. This building was repurposed from condo to rental use during the housing downturn, and the sale positively impacted the balance sheet by generating $53 million of cash and retiring $88 million of consolidated debt during the quarter.","Turning to Financial Services. This segment generated operating earnings of $17 million versus $33.2 million in the prior year. Our mortgage pretax income decreased to $14.3 million from $30.9 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations declined approximately 9% from the prior year to $1.3 billion.","As I have been highlighting for several quarters, we have been expecting the number of refinanced transactions to decline and the profit per transaction to moderate, and we did see that in our results this quarter. Refinanced loan origination volume declined about 80% from the prior year's quarter, and this has also resulted in margin compression as more competitors focused on the purchase business.","Our mortgage operations have shifted to purchase business, with the mix now 93% purchase transactions and only 7% refinance transactions.","Our title company also experienced a significant reduction in refinanced transactions but delivered a $3.4 million profit in the quarter, compared with $2.9 million of profit in the prior year.","Turning to our Rialto segment. They generated operating earnings of $13.9 million, compared to $4.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The composition of these earnings by type of investment is as follows: the investment management business, these are the funds that we manage, contributed $7.2 million of earnings; the direct investments, which are the FDIC and the bank portfolios, contributed a net of $9.2 million of earnings; and these amounts were reduced by $12.7 million of G&A and other, and that's net of management fees.","Our new Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed a net $10.2 million during the first full quarter of operations. Rialto's balance sheet is well positioned, as we fully paid off the remainder of the $627 million of FDIC debt. And during the quarter, we issued $250 million of 7% senior notes due in 2018 in Rialto. The net proceeds were used primarily to originate loans in Rialto Mortgage Finance and repay $100 million of capital to Lennar for the monies that were advanced to start up Rialto Mortgage Finance.","Turning to the Multifamily segment. This is a new segment that we separated this quarter as a result of the significant growth in the multi-family business. The initial results are the start-up expenses relating to the strong team that we've put in place that has already built the $3.7 billion pipeline that Stuart highlighted.","Turning to our balance sheet, our liquidity and leverage both improved during the quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with $700 million of cash and 0 outstanding under our $950 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Our Homebuilding net debt-to-total cap declined sequentially from 53% to 45.6%, driven by strong earnings and the conversion of the entire $277 million of principal amount of 2% convertible senior notes.","The shares from this convert were always included in our fully diluted EPS calculations, so there's no additional dilution that is suffered from this conversion. Stockholders' equity increased by $754 million during 2013 to end at $4.2 billion. Our book value per share increased to $20.39 per share.","So now let's look forward to 2014. I'd like to summarize some of what's been said on this call and highlight a few additional goals for 2014.","Number one, deliveries. We are currently geared up to deliver between 21,000 and 22,000 homes for 2014. I want to clarify the backlog conversion by quarter. We do expect a backlog conversion ratio between 75% and 80% for the first quarter, and then it jumps to 80% to 85% for the second and third quarters. And then, over 90% is expected for the fourth quarter. As Stuart mentioned, our gross margin is expected to average about 25% for the full year, and then there's going to be the normal seasonality applied between the quarters, which is lower at the beginning of the year and higher, typically, in the fourth quarter at the end of the year.","SG&A expenses. We do believe that there's an opportunity to continue to increase the operating leverage that we've been seeing, and we expect up to another 25 basis points of potential improvement in 2014.","Our Financial Services operations are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million for the year. We have very tough comparisons in the first half of the year, due to the loss of the refinanced business that I discussed. We expect the first quarter, which is typically the slowest quarter for Financial Services, to be under $5 million of profit for that quarter.","Turning to Rialto, we expect a range of profits between $30 million and $40 million for the year, with the first quarter close to breakeven and then picking up and having more consistent earnings for the rest of the year.","The Multifamily segment, we expect, will be another start-up year. We might sell a building or 2 later in the year, with the bottom line expected to be between a range of $15 million and $20 million of additional net start-up loss, while we're positioning for a much stronger 2015.","On the joint venture line, some of you might have heard recently, we had a press release about the El Toro community. We received entitlements for the 9,500 homes at the El Toro Great Park Neighborhoods, and during this process, we held off on incorporating the expected development changes until those entitlements were finalized. As a result, we're not expecting any large land sales to third-party builders until our first quarter of 2015. However, Great Park has been a tremendous success. It's approximately 30% sold out already, and we're experiencing rising sales prices.","So we continue to build tremendous value in the FivePoint assets. However, the joint venture profit line for the entire year is expected to be about breakeven.","Our 2014 effective tax rate is expected to be about 37.75% for all of 2014. And then the net community count, as was highlighted, is expected to increase about 15% from our ending count of 537 to a range of 600 to 625 by the end of 2014.","So with that, let me open it up for any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Stephen East, ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Stuart, I'll just get it over with so you won't have to answer the question and over and over. Can you talk about the progression of the orders through the quarter, what you were seeing, trend-wise, anything post-quarter? I know it's not very long. And then also, could you just -- your West was much better than we expected; and Southeast Florida, worse than expected on orders. Just maybe a little guidance on that, what was going on?","Stuart A. Miller","Yes, let me turn that over to Rick and to Jon, Steve. Rick, go ahead.","Richard Beckwitt","So Steve, from a quarter standpoint, we saw a sequential improvement during the quarter from September through November, pretty consistent month-to-month. That was consistent with regard to both number of homes sold, as well as pricing, ASP increases. So I think that, that -- we view that as a positive. As you know, it paused in sort of the late summer, and it was nice to see the improvement sequentially. As we look at -- just specifically with regard to Southeast Florida, we made some conscious decisions there to slow things down, so don't be alarmed with the decline in year-over-year new orders. The thing I would point out is we have an incredibly strong backlog there, up 50% year-over-year. And if you look at the price, ASP in Southeast Florida, you'll see that, that was dramatically up as well. So we made some conscious decision to slow things down. Jon, how about California?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Yes, Steve. In the West, we saw pretty consistent sales throughout the quarter, following the same sequential trend that Rick spoke about. But certainly, we were benefited by the grand opening at the Great Park, El Toro, generating a lot of sales there. We found Vegas was a strong market for us throughout the quarter, with good sales, and Northern California. And compared to some of the reports that you and others have put out, showing sort of declining sales in the West, we found our sales held up pretty strong and had very limited incentives that were needed to move inventory.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then Stuart, if you look at -- you talked about being optimistic on the spring. What are you looking for? When will you start getting signs of what the spring is doing, and what type of milepost would you look for to either continue to ratchet up pricing or start to use incentives in a greater way?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, historically, the exact date that the spring starts to be indicated moves around a lot. And especially over the past years, that has been the case. We always peg Super Bowl. I mean, it seems a little bit irrational, but it seems that when the Super Bowl ends, people start getting out there and looking for homes. It's more towards wintertime than actual spring, but that's when we start to get our early indications as to what's coming. What makes us think about spring as a -- or early indication being that spring is going to be a pretty responsible season is the progression of sales. As we've watched the market adjust to the interest rate increases and to the political environment being in a pretty solid state of turmoil, we did see the market adjust. And it started with traffic, but as Rick indicated and Jon indicated, we did see sequential improvement as we went through the quarter. And that, together with our traffic patterns, gives us pretty good sense, right now, that the spring selling season is starting to shape up. I'm not going to say -- I'm not going to be too aggressive in my statement, but we feel that it's shaping up to be pretty strong, given the demographic trends that we know exist, the pent-up demand that we are pretty sure exists, and some of it just coming pent-up demand from the political turmoil that we've seen. We think it's going to reveal itself in the spring, and we feel like we're really well prepared for it.","Operator","The next question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, LLC","It's actually Alan on for Ivy. Stuart, just on the spring and your comments there.","And obviously, you said you expect to see some robust activity in the spring. I was curious what kind of the mix of that looks like between volume and price because a lot of other builders, and maybe you guys to a lesser extent this year, obviously, focused on price over volume. And I think that this quarter, we've seen a modest uptick in your incentives. And I'm curious, when you think about what a robust spring selling season means, is that double-digit volume growth for you, or is it some type of combination between pricing and volume? And if the volume doesn't materialize, at what point do you use price as a lever to drive additional sales?","Richard Beckwitt","Maybe I'll take that. This is Rick. It's going to be a combination. I think that we've seen and, as you've noted, in our numbers throughout the year, you've seen some pretty dramatic price increases. I think you'll start to see some of that normalize to maybe single-digit, low double-digit paces. And as Stuart mentioned early on, we are very focused on operating margin as opposed to just the pure gross margin line. So you'll see us play a little bit with pace to accentuate some communities where we can pick up some incremental absorption to push the bottom line.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, LLC","That's really helpful. So just to kind of interpret that, then, you're confident that you could drive additional volume, even continuing to push price in that high single-digit or even low double-digit range in 2014?","Stuart A. Miller","Generally speaking, we're -- it remains our view that inventories are pretty tight out there, both on the existing and the new home front. And with rental rates having continued to climb, we feel that, as the season starts to present itself, we feel it's more likely that we're going to be able to both see volume increases and be able to manage the higher ASP.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Great. And then, just one additional one. On the gross margin guidance for flat margin guidance next year, obviously, this quarter came in above your expectations that you laid forth last quarter. Curious, what portion of that conservatism is a function of more of those quicker-turn deals that you referenced earlier? Or is it truly just higher land cost, higher cost falling through that you expect to offset the benefit of the robust selling season?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, it's a combination. We have some of those shorter-term positions that are starting to -- that are flowing through. But let's not minimize the fact that, in what I have characterized as a somewhat squishy environment, given the higher interest rates, given the political environment, now, incrementally, as we start to look at what the FHFA announced yesterday with higher guarantee fees, lower loan limits, although that's a little bit varied across the geography, there are some areas that you have to look at and conservatize your outlook. And that's exactly what we did as we presented for the third quarter. We were interested in looking and watching at how the market evolved. Likewise, as we look ahead to 2015, remember, we're getting pretty close to peak margins, both at the gross line and at the net line. And so we want to take a responsible and conservative look at where we think we're going to be. We feel comfortable with a flat and attractive margin for 2014. And we think that the environment will enable us to maintain those high and responsible growth margins as we grow our business.","Operator","The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My first question relates to land spend. I noticed that the percentage of revenues that's your land spend declined pretty noticeably this quarter, which would -- particularly from what you'd been running at earlier this year. And I guess I was curious as to if you could comment on if there's anything that we should read into that about what you believe the trajectory, near-term trajectory of land prices is likely to be or if you've see the value of land actually decline, generalizing there across the country, since, let's say, the second quarter or so?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, Steve, remember, we got way out ahead of the rest of the pack. And we bought sizable parcels of land and land positions in all of our major markets early on. We really used the cycle in a very constructive way in positioning our company for the future. So as we look ahead, I've noted in my remarks that we have been adjusting our land strategy. We are focused on leveraging the good parcels that we've purchased. It necessitates buying somewhat less land as we go forward. Now, of course, growth will necessitate that we pick up that amount -- or the amount of the spend. But you are seeing somewhat of a trend. Our land spend is down a little bit right now, and if you look at the number of homesites that we've put under contract, I highlighted 3,000 homesites that were put under contract. We are moderating. As land prices have bumped up, we're in the enviable position of not having to push the market, and we're really carefully managing the land spend. And as the market matures, you can expect to see that we will be purchasing less in the way of longer-term positions, auctioning land more aggressively and also making sure that our land purchases, land that we put under contract, comes onto our books in more of a just-in-time fashion.","Richard Beckwitt","Steve, the other thing I'd point out is -- and you see it in the numbers that our land development spend increased. And that's a function of the fact that, when we were early-cycle in buying some of these pieces, we're now putting the money into the ground in order to maximize the value of these assets and build on it. So I think, as Stuart said, we're in a transition point right now.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. Absolutely. Okay. That's very helpful. The second question relates, I guess, more to a comment I thought I heard Bruce mention about operating leverage. And by that, I'm reading into that as sort of SG&A. And I think, Bruce, you made a comment that you still think that there's additional opportunities for overhead -- or rather, operating leverage. I think you said 25 basis points in 2014. Is that -- should I be thinking that, therefore, SG&A\/corporate, as a percentage of homebuilding rev, might be down like 25 basis points, but probably not drastically more than that?","Bruce E. Gross","That's our expectation right now. We've gotten down to a point that is lower than we've been at for the last number of years. We do have some leverage, and I think 25 basis points is a good place to think about us as we look at next year. So I wouldn't go beyond that at this point.","Operator","The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan Chase.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question I had was on gross margins, just to go back to that, obviously a pretty important area in terms of modeling going forward, notwithstanding additional SG&A leverage. But with the guidance of roughly flat for the full year, and you also alluded to some seasonality, weaker in the -- lower in the first half, stronger in the back half. It would imply, if you're just kind of working off of 25% as an average, pretty sizable sequential decline from where you are right now relative to, let's say, at the end of '12 into early '13, it was more of like a 150-ish type sequential decline. And so just trying to get a sense if there's any conservatism there or any product mix shift or geographic mix that might be influencing those comments because, obviously, to end the year with an average of around 26% is pretty strong. And as you've alluded to, you still have a lot of high-quality land coming through the income statement.","Richard Beckwitt","Well, this is Rick. I think you've got to keep in mind that we are going into the seasonably lower period where we're going to get deliveries in our first quarter. Historically, our gross margin in Q1 has been 100 to 200, 300 basis points, depending on the year, lower than what our Q4 has been. You've got costs associated with winter starts and deliveries. So it's consistent with where we were last year. Keep in mind, last year, in Q1, I think we were at 22.1% gross. So guiding towards -- we're still, on a year-over-year basis, much higher than where we were last year. I guess the other thing I'd point out is, when you look at gross margins, we are so far ahead of where the rest of the pack is out there that at 25% growth, it's pretty strong.","Bruce E. Gross","And I would just add, Mike, when you think about the first quarter gross margins with that lower volume, all of our field expenses for all the construction we have get allocated over fewer closings. And that's one of the reasons why the margins are lower in that first quarter.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. No, that makes sense. And just on this topic, longer-term, I think, Stuart, you mentioned that perhaps you'd be trying to shift over the next year or 2 towards more auctioning and faster-turnover type land deals. If you could just give us a sense what type of gross margin those might represent relative to the land that's flowing through now or that you've worked on, where you had more of a longer-term approach that, typically, higher risk, you require a little bit more of a margin to offset that. If -- certainly, from an, again, an operating margin perspective, you're looking for still very solid results and further leverage on SG&A, but would that also kind of influence this idea that, hey, gross margins might move a little bit perhaps away from peak, that the shift in land purchases are part of that overall comment?","Stuart A. Miller","Yes, listen, I think that we are looking at varied margins across the platform. Some of that -- some of the shorter-term land positions are kind of at our average, and some of them are down into the high teens. So it's really a varied mix across the platform. But I don't want to overstate the shorter-term positioning that we're taking. We are also looking at more conventional land sales. It's just that, given the fact that we are able to look for land for 2016, 2017, we're really able to put things under contract that we don't have to take down until later. And those will keep -- those will be underwritten to much higher margins. So really, our averages should remain very, very strong. Some of the shorter-term positions, where we have an operating platform that's already paid for and in place, really makes sense for the company as we drive volumes and prices going forward into the recovery.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just clarification on a prior guidance. Can you just restate, Bruce, what you said the tax rate you expected to be for '14? And in the SG&A leverage, is that inclusive of corporate G&A? Or would you expect, maybe, another 10 or 20 bps of incremental leverage on the corporate G&A side?","Bruce E. Gross","Sure. We did bring down our expectations for our tax rate for next year from 38% to 37.75%. And the 25 basis points of leverage I would look at as a combined leverage between those 2 categories at this point.","Operator","The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani, KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the Rialto lending business. Can you speak to the kinds of loans you're looking to close and what the pipeline is and whether you -- I think your comments alluded to this, but whether you would do any on-balance sheet lending, such as transitional first mortgages and mezzanine loans?","Stuart A. Miller","Jeff?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","In terms of the securitization business, what we're doing is we're originating what would be more typical conduit loans, which are stabilized loans on pretty much everything from office, retail, hotel, et cetera. So it's pretty much straightforward. There's clearly an active and growing market in that arena, and our team has been doing it for over 20 years. As it relates to transitional lending, we are not doing any balance sheet transitional lending. And we are doing some mezzanine loans, but we're doing those mezzanine loans, as Stuart mentioned, in a separate vehicle, for which we are in the process of raising additional capital right now.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Great. Can you talk about if -- I mean, what you kind of expect for overall origination volume next year and what the size of the current pipeline is? And if you could just speak to the average loan size that you're able to take down?","Stuart A. Miller","We haven't started looking forward and putting out projected numbers. This is still -- we still view ourselves as being in a startup mode. We think that the $700 million of originations and securitization in the fourth quarter gives a good indication of the potential power in this segment of our Rialto business. And we do think that, over time, it's going to help define and refine a visible and predictable stream of earnings. But I think it's a little too early to start putting out projected numbers and to start putting too much quarterly pressure on that group. As I say, we're still starting up and getting the engine well oiled.","Operator","The next question is coming from Adam Rudiger, Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned -- I think, it was in the release that the -- and in your prepared commentary, that the Rialto segment was transitioning into more of an asset-light segment. And I was curious -- I understand the light activities that you're doing there. I was curious what the -- if there was any change or any speedup in terms of the plans for disposition of the more heavier assets, meaning the FDIC and the bank portfolios, and what the strategy there is?","Stuart A. Miller","Yes. As we're positioned right now, we have about $400 million invested on balance sheet in some of those earlier asset-heavy kind of acquisitions. We expect, over the -- if you kind of straight-line over the next 3 years, we think that's kind of a good benchmark. There will be some stragglers that go into the fourth, but that's kind of a good benchmark as to how those assets will be liquidated and, ultimately, come back into cash. As far as investing going forward, we really aren't doing any new investing outside of the platforms that we have in place. And of course, with the $1.3 billion raise now basically completed, that gives us a lot of runway in terms of being able to invest in new assets going forward. And the mezzanine program, of course, is a complement to the fund management business that we've had in place to date.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, did I hear correctly that the FDIC loan is paid off, so that, that $400 million, or the underlying investments behind that $400 million, will start flowing back to you now?","Stuart A. Miller","Yes, that's correct. We had a little over $600 million of debt that had to be paid off in its entirety first. That was paid off in 2013. And we are already seeing cash flowing back on the equity investment. Jeff, what was the amount that's actually come back?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","It was -- in total, so far, it's $80 million. We're 40% of that, so it's a little over $30 million that's coming back -- that has come back or is coming back over the next couple of days.","Stuart A. Miller","And we anticipate seeing greater cash flows as we go through 2014.","Operator","The next question is coming from Ken Zener, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Gentlemen, versus your guidance, do you think you're more likely to be over on gross margins or closings? As it seems to imply, your guidance for closings, vis-\u00e0-vis your community count, seems to imply only modest sales gains in the sales pace, so basically seasonality. What does that ramp look like in communities off the 4Q base?","Stuart A. Miller","Look, the balance between volume and margin is more of an art than a science, and we'll have to manage that as market conditions present themselves. I think the question as to whether we're more likely to beat on one or the other, I think that we're giving guidance thinking that's where we're going to actually be. And as we go through the year and as we feel market conditions present themselves, I think we're going to navigate that balance on a day-by-day basis in each division at a very local level. One of the complications in our business is the business is so local that, that balance being struck at the local levels, you can't really nationalize what's actually happening until you actually roll up the numbers. So to give you a good answer on that, as it stands right now, I would -- looking at -- looking ahead to next year, I would have to say where we're more likely to outperform is probably both, and that's kind of our feeling right now. But staying conservative, we've given numbers that we feel comfortable with.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And if I could follow up, given your -- I appreciate your conversion rates. I think it tends to reflect the fact that you build homes outside of backlog. Could you comment on the margin spread you are seeing between spec homes and backlog? Given the conversion rate, that could be part of your margin swing as well. And, to the extent you noticed a difference between spec buyers who might be moving related to jobs compared to someone that's perhaps more patient and taking down a home out of backlog?","Stuart A. Miller","Jon, you've been quiet. Why don't you take that one?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Those tend to be higher-margin on our backlog, which are presales before construction. But as Stuart said, it's a very local business. And that will range dramatically from state to state and even within local markets, depending on product type. So a multi-family condo or townhome will have a smaller spread than, perhaps, a larger single-family home. But we do see the buyers who are relocation tend to be more of that spec buyers or someone coming out of an apartment, whereas someone coming out of an existing home is someone, typically, that is going to be a presale.","Operator","The next question is coming from David Goldberg of UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question, obviously, the pickup in incentives was very small. And I not to put too fine a focus on it, but I kind of want to think a little bit bigger term here and think about other builders are reacting when they're seeing an increased use of incentives. Are you finding your competitors in markets are trying to match you guys, outdo you for sales at this point, or are they kind of holding back more? And I mean, how would you expect that -- just given your historical experience, how do you think that's going to play out as you go through the selling season if it ends up that demand isn't quite as good as you think?","Stuart A. Miller","I think that everybody is really carefully managing the balance between leveraging their overhead, increasing their average sales price and maximizing the good land assets that they have, recognizing that they're very, very difficult to replace. So you have, in my opinion, a very responsible competitive environment pretty much across the platform right now. And if you think about that and put it in historical perspective, David, there have been times where land has been more plentiful and more easily replaceable. And in those kinds of times, you probably have a much more competitive spirit in terms of just driving volume. That does not seem to be the case right now. Everybody's trying to manage that balance between volume and maximizing return on what they view as a scarce asset.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's very helpful color. I was wondering, Stuart, you've given some really good color on the mortgage market loosening in past quarters. And I wonder if you could talk about kind of what you've seen in the most recent quarter? I know you talked about the FHFA and higher G fees and maybe some changes with the FHA, but as you look out to 2014, what are your expectations in terms of mortgage market, maybe from reemergence of private mortgage insurers and the impact that's going to have on the entry level as we move kind of into the next stage of this recovery?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, we're at an interesting inflection point where the mortgage market is evolving, in a free market sense, but the government is very involved, and there are a lot of opinions at the governmental level right now. We see an outgoing Ed DeMarco waving goodbye in a very complicated way at a complicated time with the announcement yesterday. And we have an unknown in the incoming head of FHFA. I think that everybody's aware that a derailing of the mortgage market in the context of a somewhat tepid recovery to date is problematic for overall economic recovery. So I think we're going to have to kind of wait and see over the next month how the mortgage market presents itself and what kind of governmental adjustments will or might be made. I wouldn't be surprised if some of what's been that gets rolled back. I wouldn't be surprised if there are more incremental difficulties presented for the mortgage market. That being said, I think that they will be incremental. I think that the overall housing market will find its way to adjusting, and we'll have to navigate our way through it. But I think that there are some question marks and headwinds out there, but I think that the strength in the recovery and general strength in the economy are going to overcome them.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But is it fair to surmise you're not expecting much loosening as you move into next year as you kind of look out to your estimates in your land purchasing?","Stuart A. Miller","That I would not be expecting as much loosening? I think the banks are going to continue to loosen. Remember, the refi business has all but evaporated. It's a small shadow of itself. And the banks are really replacing some of that income stream by taking away some of the overlays that they've had in place. I think there's likely to be some loosening as we go forward, but there will be some counterbalancing to that with some other elements, higher interest rates and other things. But overall, I think, everybody is holding hands, recognizing that a vibrant mortgage market is the key to the housing market continuing its recovery and, ultimately, to creating jobs and creating economic prosperity across the country.","Operator","The last question is coming from Jack Micenko, SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Two questions. First one. Looking at, first, wondering if you could help us on homebuilding land sales. The top line sale number's come down year-to-year, and I'm thinking about it in the context of slowing your land investment and more of this old high-margin land becoming more of the mix. Should we think about homebuilding land sales continuing to decline on sort of the trajectory we saw in '13 versus '12, or can you give us any feel for how that would look, potentially, for modeling purposes?","Bruce E. Gross","Sure. From the standpoint of modeling purposes, we're not expecting much in the way of sales of land. So the number came down. We're certainly not anticipating it -- sometimes, you have the opportunity to move out of one position into another opportunity that's nearby. So generally, we're not anticipating land sales. If they happen, it's more of a strategic focus as we're looking at other opportunities. But for modeling purposes, generally, we don't model land sales, and it's something I would say not to include in the model any land profit. It's not what we're focused on.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then, Jeff, on the commercial mortgage side. With the $700 million in production, I'm wondering if you're seeing any behavior changes at the competitor banks. Are they potentially responding based on -- if you're hearing anything around price on the spread or maybe on the term or duration of the loan, anything there, as you sort of create another option for stabilized borrowers out there?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","It's a competitive market, but we have a very, very strong eye on credit. So we maintain our position. But it's a growing market. And you have -- over the next several years, you have hundreds of billions of dollars of loans that are coming up -- coming to maturity that are going to need to be refinanced. So we see our position as a great position as that market continues to expand.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Good. And then, on the credit side, do you said you have recourse on those loans. And what's the nature of the recourse if you do?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","The typical conduit loan is a nonrecourse loan, and we're looking to the credit of the underlying real estate as support for the -- and again, these are stabilized assets that have cash loans coming from rents or under leases.","Stuart A. Miller","Okay. Very good. That wraps up our conference call for 2013. We look forward to reporting a successful 2014. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time."],"12941":["Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call June 26, 2018 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Alexandra Lumpkin - Investor Relations","Stuart Miller - Executive Chairman","Rick Beckwitt - Chief Executive Officer","Jon Jaffe - President","Diane Bessette - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Stephen East - Wells Fargo","Alan Ratner - Zelman and Associates","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI","John Lovallo - Bank of America","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Buck Horne - Raymond James","Operator","Welcome to Lennar\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Alexandra Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statement.","Alexandra Lumpkin","Thank you and good morning.

Sir, you may now begin.","Stuart Miller","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you, Alex. And let me say that I am here this morning with some brand new people. I am here with Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer; Jon Jaffe, our President; and Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer among others.","And let me go ahead and start and say that I am going to give a general overview as I always have. Rick and Jon will then give the real operational overview and Diane will deliver further detail on the numbers. It\u2019s hard to believe, but this is our first full quarter conference call as a combined Lennar CalAtlantic platform, so we have a lot of ground to cover. Jon and Rick will give a comprehensive update on our now combined operations and progress on synergies and Diane will give detail on how purchased accounting has affected our results and reconcile our quarterly results to our guidance and to consensus expectations. When we get to Q&A, as always I would like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up.","So let me go ahead and begin by saying that our excellent quarterly results derived from a great deal of hard work that\u2019s been done both in our division offices and here in the corporate office. I said it last quarter and I am going to say it again, it all comes down to a great team of professionals coming together and working cooperatively. From the people here in this room with me today to the many throughout the Lennar offices, we are thankful for their hard, diligent and focused work. Because of the manner in which our team has worked and grown through this acquisition, I have continued to become increasingly enthusiastic about the evolving position of our company as a leader in the homebuilding industry. We are not only well-positioned to execute on our current operational strategies, but we have become ever more adaptable and nimble adjusting to the changing landscapes around us. As a management team, we believe that we are excellently structured and positioned to continue to grow our business, while we leverage scale in each of our markets to drive efficiencies and implement new technologies to enhance our operating platform.","Overall, the housing market has remained strong and seems to continue to strengthen. Even with questions about rising interest rates, labor shortages, rising construction costs and the macro international trade tensions, the housing market has remained resilient. There continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market. Unemployment is at historic lows. The labor participation rate is increasing and wages are higher. Consumers in our welcome home centers confirm that the dual income producing family is resurgent and they feel confident, because economic conditions have remained strong and stable and\/or improving.","The deficit in the production of new homes that has existed since the market crash has driven a serious supply shortage, while demand is strong. The millennial population is forming households and having children, so short supply with strong demand is sustaining this recovery and overcoming headwinds. And since land and labor shortages are limiting affordable production, it will still take some time. It will still take some years to get to equilibrium.","The Federal Tax Act continues to add additional momentum to the economic and housing landscape, while many continue to express concerns about the effect of the tax law on housing, it is proving to be a positive to the wallet of our customer base and stimulative to the economy overall, which is good for housing. Accordingly, with strong management focus and execution, one can see that we have not missed a beat. We have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins exceed expectations this quarter and we are well-positioned for the remainder of the year.","Before I turn over to Rick and Jon, let me make a few short strategic notes. First, 42.4%, that\u2019s our debt to total capitalization at the end of the second quarter. Our net debt to total cap is 40%. As noted in our press release, we have used strong cash flow to start paying down debt and rightsizing our balance sheet. We paid down $825 million of higher interest rate notes plus the remaining $250 million of Rialto notes and we did it out of strong cash flow and without refinance. We will remain focused on the reduction of debt and will continue to drive strong cash flow as we look to the future.","Next, the pay-down of Rialto\u2019s remaining outstanding debt paves the way to a seamless repositioning of that enterprise. As noted in our last conference call, we have engaged Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo to consider the proper strategic alternatives for Rialto\u2019s future. We have begun a formal process for that consideration and we will give public update as warranted. We noted last quarter a timeframe of approximately 12 months from then to conclude this process. While I don\u2019t have further updates on the Rialto process at this time, we remain committed to our strategy of reverting to our pure-play core homebuilding platform.","Finally, some have noted with interest our recent reinvestment in Open Door, a leading technology company that automates the valuation of homes and executes purchase offers to customers at those values. Open Door is simply taking the friction out of the home transaction. We first invested in the Open Door platform, 1.5 years ago. We believed that Open Door\u2019s strategy of reducing friction in the home sale market would be transformational to the industry, while very compatible with our new home homebuilding strategy. Many interested Lennar customers come to our welcome home centers with a home to sell. Open Door is there to help. Additionally, many customers outgrow their first home as their families grow, Open Door is there to help. Some potential Lennar customers postpone the move-up purchase, because engaging the broker and showing their home over months is a dreaded experience, Open Door is there to help.","Just like selling a used car used to strike fear in the potential new car buyers, selling a used home causes procrastination in the potential move-up purchaser and Open Door is there to help. Lennar invested in the Open Door opportunity to alleviate the stress and friction embedded in our transaction. We believed in the concept, we underwrote the capability of the management team and we concluded that together Lennar and Open Door could make serious changes to our industry as well as to our customer interface and could drive cost as well as friction out of the way that people buy and sell homes.","To-date, this partnership has worked exceptionally well and it\u2019s getting better and expanding to more markets. Lennar is selling more homes enabled by the Open Door program. We are accommodating customers who come to us with a home to sell and we are also reaching out to existing first-time homeowners with a growing family and enabling them to avoid the friction and the aggravation and purchase of move-up homes, with the rooms they need, the space they want and the new home technologies they crave. Open Door benefits from our managerial and operational experience and we benefit from their technology and innovative approach to the home sales market. This Open Door story is a proxy for Lennar\u2019s technology strategy. We look for ideas that can work and enhance our customers experience while building a better business platform. There is no hype, just execution.","We look for great technology management teams that can execute on technology platforms that we don\u2019t have the talent or the resource to develop. We invest and then we have let our formidable scale and management guidance enable the business to adapt and to grow. We get better and they get better. Open Door is not our only technology initiative. We have now worked with the talented management teams of Blend the digital mortgage platform notarized the digital notary company and Blueprint, the energy network company, among others. These are not investments that are part of the strategy. We are investing in technologies and tech teams that can change our industry and enhance our company\u2019s execution. We are simply building a better mousetrap.","So with that said, let me conclude where I started. It really all comes down to people. People make the trains run on time. Sales, starts, closings and margins, it\u2019s the people. People focus on cash flow and right-size the balance sheet. People find the strategic directions for ancillary businesses and revert to core. People find new technologies and they adapt and change and incorporate them into old school companies. People execute and we have great people and great teams and I am proud to be a part of this team. We have accomplished a great deal and have a lot of exciting work ahead of us. It\u2019s the people that have and will make the difference and I once again thanked the associates across our platform, our operating platforms for their diligence and their expertise. Because of them, I can comfortably say that our company, Lennar, is well-prepared to continue to execute.","So with that, let me turn over to Rick and Jon.","Rick Beckwitt","Thanks, Stuart. Let me quickly start by summarizing our results in the second quarter and then Jon and I will update you on the CalAtlantic integration. Net earnings for the quarter totaled $310 million, up 45% from 2017. Our core homebuilding operations really produced. New orders for the quarter totaled 14,440 homes, up 62% from the prior year, with the dollar value of approximately $6 billion, representing a 79% increase. We delivered 12,095 homes in the quarter, which was up 57% from 2017. Revenues in the quarter totaled $5.5 billion, representing a 67% increase. We ended the quarter with a solid sales backlog of 19,622 homes, with a dollar value of $8.6 billion, up 92% and 114% respectively from 2017. Our gross margin, excluding the backlog and construction in progress write-up, totaled 21.6%, which was the top of the range we guided to last quarter.","Finally, our SG&A in the quarter was 8.7%. This marks an all-time second quarter low, significantly lower than our prior guidance and highlights the power of our increased geographic scale and our operating leverage. These results were achieved by a lot of hard work from our associates across the country driving our day-to-day business and focused on the CalAtlantic integration. I can\u2019t think of our associates enough for everything they have accomplished. While these numbers demonstrate the success of our integration, let me give you some additional color on where we stand. Operationally, CalAtlantic is fully integrated into Lennar and we are operating as one company. This transition has proceeded smoothly and we are well ahead of schedule. More importantly, we are now realizing the true operating synergies stemming from our new local and national market scale.","As I highlighted last quarter, our homebuilding operation has 5 regions and 38 divisions with operations in 49 markets. Prior to the merger, CalAtlantic had 4 regions and 27 divisions, with operations in 43 markets. Two of the CalAtlantic divisions were new markets to Lennar and continue today. The remaining 25 divisions have been combined with the Lennar divisions resulting in significant SG&A savings. Operationally, we have been able to maintain or increase our market share, reduce cycle time and increased absorption, while reducing headcount by approximately 33%. We also eliminated 5 corporate and regional offices, 21 homebuilding division offices, 18 design centers, 24 financial services branches and 1 financial services processing center. The transition from the CalAtlantic design center program to the Everything\u2019s Included program has been impressive and is reducing cycle times and construction cost.","Excluding the CalAtlantic closeout communities, 207 communities have been converted to Lennar products, 136 communities have continued with CalAtlantic products, but converted to an Everything\u2019s Included products and the remaining 30 communities are continuing with an option-light CalAtlantic product. Our intense focus on product conversion is really showing its benefits and reduced cycle times. On average, we are saving approximately 30 to 40 days by converting the CalAtlantic product to Lennar product and approximately 25 to 30 days by converting the CalAtlantic design center products to an Everything\u2019s Included product. Jon will highlight the significant cost savings and increased access to trades we are seeing from this conversion. Keep in mind that we are now the number one builder in 20 markets and a top three builder in 32 markets and that our market share in our number one markets range between 21% and 43%, with an average share of approximately 30%. This critical mass will continue to increase our operating leverage. We just are seeing the beginning of our leverage in the last quarter.","This market share has significantly increased our access to land. Simply put, landowners and developers are finding that they both want and need us in their community. With this in mind, we have met with many leading developers and third-party capital sources to explore new mutually beneficial structures. On the technology side and the systems side, we are making good progress on our homebuilding system migration and we will be completing two more divisions this week. We are on track to be migrating 2 to 3 divisions each week for the next few months until completed. We have also completed the system migration for our financial services operation and now are currently writing all mortgages out of our Eagle mortgage operation. We are already seeing the benefits of this capture rate from the legacy CalAtlantic communities where we have increased capture rate from 60% to approximately 80% and we feel that there is increased opportunity over the entire platform given our larger scale.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jon.","Jon Jaffe","Thanks, Rick. I\u2019d like to bring you up-to-date on where we are with our focus on cost synergies. On last quarter\u2019s call, we communicated that we expect to exceed our synergy\u2019s target of $100 million for fiscal year \u201818 by $25 million. I am pleased to report that we are now on track to exceed that target by an additional $35 million for total fiscal year 2018 synergies of $160 million. For fiscal year 2019, we are now on track to exceed our $365 million target by $10 million for a total of $380 million. Approximately, $160 million of expected savings for 2018 breaks down to about $80 million for corporate expenses and SG&A savings and $80 million for direct construction cost savings.","For the corporate expenses and SG&A savings, we have locked in about $80 million of synergies that\u2019s made up of the following categories. Corporate G&A represents about $35 million made up of executive and administrative compensation, along with public company expenses. Operational SG&A savings of about $45 million are from the reduction in associate headcount in the regions and divisions, along with the closing of offices that Rick highlighted. We now estimate that 2019 annual run-rate for these overhead savings at $115 million exceeding our target of $100 million for 2019. Becoming the builder of choice for national manufacturers, suppliers and local trades, it\u2019s a key to achieving our direct construction cost synergies. We have now identified approximately $80 million of savings for 2018 exceeding the increased target of $65 million we gave you last quarter. Our significant market scale, combined with our efficient Everything\u2019s Included platform, are very big drivers of these savings. Additionally, our intense focus on even flow production, jobsite readiness, cycle span accuracy and dynamic pricing all enhance our relationships with our trade partners increasing the number of bids we received for our work.","Last quarter, I spoke about kicking off our cost synergy workshops. We have now conducted workshops at 23 divisions. The key areas of focus at the workshops are value engineering, takeoff verification and leveraging our increased scale. We identify, validate and collect cost synergies across all labor and material categories as well as improve building practices. We also evaluate every opportunity to improve utilization of our national supplier programs to increase the rebate opportunity. The information from each workshop is compiled for tracking our execution and then shared with all other Lennar division. Through this process, we are able to add quickly on opportunities identified in any one of our divisions across our entire platform. I feel strongly that these workshops, which involve our national supply chain team, our regional purchasing teams and our division management teams are the key to driving our ability to meet and exceed our direct cost saving or direct cost synergy plans. The 23 divisions that have completed a workshop are all above their respective synergy targets demonstrating the effectiveness of this process.","Let me briefly describe the top 5 categories driving our division synergy plans for 2019. Plans and specification changes will total about $50 million of savings. We select lower cost home plans and overall specification rightsizing as identified at our workshops. Value engineering at the workshops for framing and lumber, along with leveraging our local scale for this category with our trade partners will represent over $30 million of savings. For drywall, flooring and HVAC, we will save around $10 million in each of these categories through our national programs and leveraging our local scale with the trades.","Given our progress in these and other categories, we are on track to meet or exceed our 2019 target of $265 million of direct construction cost synergies. We expect to accomplish this despite the backdrop of serious industry headwinds of a tight labor market, elevated lumber prices and international trade tariffs. We do not expect to see any softening in the labor supply, especially with the current political environment on immigration. Here our success in being the Builder of Choice with the trades gives us a strategic operating advantage as we attract more trades to bid our work. We now see approximately 5 to 6 bids as compared to 2 to 3 bids for most trade categories. We believe lumber, which is at an all-time high of over $600 per thousand board feet has peaked and expect to see some softening as more lumber inventories freed up due to increased availability of transportation.","With respect to tariffs, we are protected on most of our national contracts, where we have seen some impact as with products like rebar in markets that are dependent upon foundation still, this increase in rebar can be a few hundred dollars per home. To a lesser extent, there are some minor increases in products such as garage doors, screws and nails. As I did last quarter, I want to highlight Lennar\u2019s quarterly operations review. This is the process that pulls together all of the pieces. Here Rick or I and sometimes Stuart, along with the regional presidents, the regional operations controller and the division management team address all aspects of our business. We cover merger-related issues, associated, customers, trade partners, land plan financials and more. These sessions keep us connected and on track to accomplish our goals.","I also want to thank our incredible associates and our first full quarter as a merge company they tackled the challenges of the integration while exceeding all of our second quarter expectations. Their dedication, hard work and focus inspire us all. I would also like to thank our trade partners from manufacturers and suppliers to the local trades. The open discussions and resulting agreements on how to improve both of our businesses are clear evidence of the effectiveness of this merger.","With that, I would like to turn it over to Diane.","Diane Bessette","Thank you, Jon and good morning to everyone. Before I provide the details of our second quarter results, let me give a simple analysis of our numbers as compared to consensus to assist in understanding some of the noise in the quarter. Our reported EPS is $0.94 and the average of all analyst estimates is $0.41. The difference is $0.53. This difference of $0.53 can be separated into two categories: first, non-operating items, representing $0.35 of the difference and second, operating items representing $0.18 of the difference. This $0.18 is our operating feet or our outperformance as you compare expectations to actual results.","So, let me give you the details of the two categories starting with the non-operating items. There are three distinct components to this category. The first item is the CalAtlantic purchase accounting write-up of backlog and construction in progress. The expectation for Q2 was to record approximately $350 million of write-up. The actual amount recorded was approximately $240 million. The difference between these two amounts is just timing and will flow through in subsequent quarters. The total amount of write-up for fiscal 2018 is approximately the same. The second item is integration costs such as severance and lease termination. The expectation for Q2 cost was $29 million and the actual costs were just $24 million. The third item is tax rate. The expected Q2 tax rate was 24% and the actual tax rate was 19.7%. The difference relates to the impacts of energy credits that were taken in the quarter.","Now, let me turn to the operating items category. The difference between expectations and actual results relate to the increase in Q2 deliveries, average sales price and operating margins or as I previously stated this is our operating out-performance. So with that backdrop, let me walk you through the details of our second quarter results starting with homebuilding. Revenues from home sales increased 74% in the second quarter driven by a 57% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and an 11% increase in average sales price to $413,000. Both of these increases were primarily a result of the CalAtlantic acquisition. As Rick noted, our second quarter gross margin on home sales was 21.6%, excluding the CalAtlantic purchase accounting write-up of backlog and construction in progress. The prior year\u2019s gross margin percent was 21.5% and gross margins in the second quarter were highest in our homebuilding U.S. segment.","And just a few comments about our second quarter gross margins. Sales incentives improved 40 basis points to 5.3% from 5.7% and direct construction costs were up about 7% to $59.64 per square foot driven by a 7% increase in labor and an 8% increase in material costs. Also as Rick noted, our second quarter SG&A percent was 8.7%, which was the lowest Q2 SG&A in the company\u2019s history compared to 9.3% in the prior year. The improvement was due to improved operating leverage as Rick details as well as continued benefit from our technology initiatives.","So as a result of the above noted gross margin and SG&A percent, our second quarter operating margin was 12.9%, excluding the write-up of backlog and construction in progress compared to 12.1% in the prior year. We opened 163 new communities during the second quarter and closed 182 communities to end the quarter with 1,325 net active communities. New orders increased 62% and the new order dollar value increased 79% again primarily as a result of CalAtlantic.","As we highlighted on our last conference call, during the second quarter, where we were transitioning CalAtlantic products, we expected our sales pace to be about 3.4%. However we exceeded that expectation with an actual sales pace of 3.6%. Our completed unsold homes were 1,478 homes at quarter end, which is roughly about 1 home per community. This is a decrease from about 1.5 homes per community in the prior year. During the second quarter, we purchased 9,600 home sites totaling $692 million and have land development spend of $557 million. Our home sites owned and controlled were 261,000, of which 195,000 are owned and 66,000 are controlled. And finally, the second quarter joint venture land sale and other category had a combined $17.9 million of earnings compared to a loss last year of $15.9 million primarily driven by the profitability of two strategic land sales.","And then turning to financial services, in our second quarter, our financial services segment had operating earnings of $52.4 million compared to $43.7 million in the prior year. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $34.7 million from $32 million in the prior year. Originations increased to $2.9 billion from $2.3 billion, 96% of originations are now from purchase business, while only 4% are from refis. As we have noted for a while, this drop in refis has led to a very competitive market that is going after purchase business and is leading to lower profit per loan originated. We went live on April 1 with a new digital mortgage platform for the combined company using a mortgage application technology from Blend. The platform is already being used in 77% of our mortgage applications. The results have shown a several day reductions in the mortgage process and have streamlined improved customer experience. Total operating earnings increased to $16.4 million from $9.7 million in the prior year. The increase was due to the addition of CalAtlantic closings and a higher mix of purchase business with higher transaction values versus the prior year.","And then turning to multifamily, in the second quarter, our multifamily segment had operating earnings of $14.8 million compared to $6.5 million in the prior year. The earnings were primarily driven by $17.4 million from the sale of two operating properties as well as $5.2 million of promote revenue related to two properties in our LMV Fund I. We ended the quarter with 19 completed and operating properties and 31 under construction, 7 of which are leased up totaling approximately 14,600 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $4.9 billion. Including these communities, we have a total diversified development pipeline of approximately $9.5 billion in over 25,000 apartments.","And then turning to Rialto, in the second quarter, Rialto had operating earnings of $7 million compared to $6.2 million in the prior year and both of those amounts are net of non-controlling interest. The details of the segment businesses are as follows. The investment management business contributed $30.3 million of earnings primarily driven by $18.7 million of management fees. Rialto Mortgage Finance business contributed $209 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $8.7 million before their G&A expenses. Direct investments had a loss of $7.5 million as we monetized the remaining assets from the bank portfolios and G&A and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, were $24.5 million and benefited from the retirement of Rialto\u2019s $350 million, 7% senior notes. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 19.7%. The rate is lower than prior year of $33.8 million primarily due to a lower federal tax rate and as previously mentioned the impact of new energy efficient home credits that were extended to be available for homes closed in 2017.","And then turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $932 million of cash. And as Stuart mentioned, during the quarter, we repaid $575 million of 8.38% CalAtlantic senior notes using homebuilding cash. As a result, net debt to total cap was 40%. During the quarter, we also paid off the remaining $250 million of Rialto\u2019s 7% senior notes and on June 1 we repaid $250 million of 6.9% Lennar senior notes also using homebuilding cash, thus a total reduction of $1.1 billion. Stockholders\u2019 equity increased to $13.6 billion and our book value per share grew to $41.25 per share.","So, now turning to our guidance for the balance of the year starting with homebuilding, for deliveries in new orders, we reaffirm our previous guidance as follows. We expect Q3 deliveries and new orders to be $12,500. We expect Q4 deliveries to be $15,000 and new orders to be $11,600. For our average sales price, we expect Q3 average sales price to be about $410,000 and Q4 about $415,000.","For gross margins, we expect Q3 gross margins, excluding write-ups for backlog and construction in progress to be between 21.5% and 21.75% and Q4 gross margins to be between 22.5% and 22.75% given the higher deliveries in that quarter. As previously mentioned, some of the write-ups for backlog and construction in progress have shifted. And so we now expect to record approximately $100 million in Q3 and approximately $50 million in Q4. And for SG&A, we expect Q3 SG&A to be about 8.7% and Q4 about 8.0%, again given the higher deliveries in that quarter. We expect our net community count to end the year at about 1,350. And finally for the combined category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, we expect Q3 to be about breakeven and Q4 earnings of about $8 million.","Turning to Financial Services, we expect Q3 earnings to be about $60 million and Q4 earnings between $63 million and $68 million. For multifamily, we expect Q3 to be a slight loss and Q4 to have earnings of about $35 million. And for Rialto, we expect Q3 earnings to be about $15 million and Q4 earnings between $28 million and $38 million. For corporate G&A, we expect to see leverage with the full year at 1.8% of total revenue. For integration costs, we believe that we will have a small amount of continuing integration costs in Q3 and Q4, approximately $10 million in each quarter. For our tax rate, we expect the tax rate for Q3 and for Q4 to be 24%. For share count, the weighted average share count for Q3 and Q4 should be about 330 million shares.","And so then looking at EPS, as you put together the components of our guidance, our Q3 EPS excluding the write-up of backlog and construction in progress and integration costs should be in the range of $1.40 to $1.45. This range increases the low end of the range previously provided during our last conference call. And Q4 EPS, again excluding the write-up of backlog and construction in progress and integration costs should be in the range of $2.10 to $2.20. This is also an increase to the low end of the range previously provided. We remain on target with our cash flow generation forecast of $2 billion to $2.5 billion before CalAtlantic related costs, ancillary businesses and debt pay-downs.","So, in conclusion with these goals in mind, we are well positioned to deliver another strong and profitable year in 2018. And now I will turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Rick Beckwitt","Stephen, are you there?","Stephen East","Yes, can you hear me?","Rick Beckwitt","There we go. There we go.","Stephen East","Alright. Congratulations on the quarter. Nice quarter and thanks for all the detail. Start first there is a lot of chatter in our side of the world about slowing demand. I guess we haven\u2019t really seen in our fieldwork other than seasonal slowing looking at your numbers given all the integration with CalAtlantic, it looks like you are not seeing it, but I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, so are you seeing any slowdown, anything other than seasonal and if so where are you seeing it and in what type of product?","Jon Jaffe","I think seasonal is exactly the right way to describe it, Steve, this is Jon, across the platform. We are seeing the economic environment of strong job growth, good economy and very low inventory supporting demand as you see in your fieldwork. So, we are definitely seeing the seasonal change. We had a strong spring as evidenced by our second quarter results, but we are not seeing anything that causes us to think otherwise.","Stuart Miller","It goes back to some of my opening remarks, Steve. You are still looking at short supply and a growing demand. It\u2019s very hard to put affordable product on the ground and there is short supply of that in the existing market as well. And I think cutting against some of the headwinds, you just have that production deficit in a growing demand from the millennials that are all coming of that age where they are forming families and demand patterns still seem strong, flies in the face of some of the noise that we hear in the press, but there is a lot of confidence and people are still coming out to buy homes.","Stephen East","Alright, great. And then on the integration savings, I was wondering how long it takes you to bump up the $365 million and it didn\u2019t take you long. So I guess two questions around that. One, does that include as you look out and we continue to see this inflation, is that net of the inflation or is that built into it? And then I guess Jon maybe a little bit more specifically where you are getting if you rank ordered the incremental bumps you are seeing in both \u201818 and \u201819 a little bit more specificity on where that\u2019s coming from?","Jon Jaffe","We talk about the synergy numbers that is from what the marketplace is. So, for example, if lumber went up, but we say $1 a foot and we brought our framing and labor contracts down $0.50, our net might be up $0.50, our synergy is $0.50 if you follow that example. With respect to where we are seeing it, it\u2019s really as I said given a lot of details that come out of ours workshops that deal with perhaps the way a type of lumber for a top plate or the way corner is put together or foundations the way we are working with our framers on some free-cutting of material, panelizing material and putting those panels together, it\u2019s really working across the spectrum of all trades. So, it\u2019s hard to say that it\u2019s all here or there, because you also have geographic differences. So in some markets, we will find we have a bigger opportunity in one category and in another market it will be in a different category.","Stephen East","Got it, okay. On the EI and I know in the field we saw where you are keeping some of the CalAtlantic plans if you will, but you are going to value engineer those, will you get the same type of cost savings from those that you would have gotten from an E&I \u2013 from an EI switch?","Rick Beckwitt","In many cases, we will get more cost savings from those. So, I really want to reiterate that most of the CalAtlantic product that we will be continuing to build in the future will be EI and there will be few communities that have a handful of communities that have a modified or lighter option program similar to what we do in Texas with village builders.","Jon Jaffe","As I said, Stephen, in my comments we look at an 1,800 square foot plan for a specific submarket for a specific customer type and we had a Lennar plan and a CalAtlantic plan, we look at which is the lower cost plan to produce that also will satisfy the needs of that market. So, it\u2019s very much a, what\u2019s the best plan, which one is the most cost efficient to build, which one has the best cycle plan.","Stephen East","Okay, thanks a lot and congratulations.","Rick Beckwitt","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Alan Ratner","Hi, guys. Good morning. Congrats on all of the very impressive progress and congrats to Rick and Jon and Diane and Bruce if you are in the room as well listening quietly. So, what I wanted to touch on a little bit was your comments on the land front and I know you have the quote in the release and you mentioned in the prepared remarks as well just the momentum and progress you are seeing as far as your conversations with landowners and sellers. And I was hoping to dig in a little bit more on that and really determine exactly what you are seeing there? If I look at your lot count about a quarter of your lots today are controlled through options, so when you are reading between the lines what I think I am hearing is you are expecting to see some progress there moving that number higher. So, I was just curious if there is an internal target or goal there that you are willing to share with us and then kind of connecting the dots there on the cash side very impressive generation and de-leveraging this quarter. I was hoping you could just give us an update on your current thinking on cash generation as well as the timing of debt repurchase and any potential buyback activity as well?","Rick Beckwitt","So, it\u2019s Rick. On the land side, we have an intense focus right now. Jon and I are regional presidents, Stuart we have been all over the country meeting with these key developers to create some pretty interesting structures to increase our activity. What we found is the deals are coming to us right now, because when you have a 20% to 40% market share, you need to be included. And so where there were times in the past, where we had to hunt them down, the hunt is not happening right now. So based on that, what we are trying to do is increase the amount of option business that we can deal, which is a little bit lower margin business, but a higher IRR business and we are engaged in conversations across the country with these leading developers and capital sources to create something that\u2019s special and it\u2019s you will see an increase in our option business that will help our cash position and it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time to do that, but as we move into 2019, you will see some dramatic change.","Alan Ratner","Thanks, Rick. And then just on the cash generation, I think you had given the number of $2 billion for the remainder of the year and I think the current thinking is this year, you are really focused on paying down debt getting to a net debt level similar to where you were before the deal by the end of the year and then \u201819 having some capacity either for some share repurchase activity, additional M&A etcetera. So, is that still kind of the right way to think about that?","Stuart Miller","I think in terms of size and scope the answer is yes. I think we leave optionality open to ourselves in terms of how cash will be deployed particularly as we look ahead numerous quarters. But I think that you can see from the numbers posted today, the cash generation is squarely in the middle of our scope. We are paying down debt at an accelerated rate. We are really pleased that we got through this quarter with the ability to pay down as much as we did without refinance and it sets up the rest of the year, which is even more cash generative. So as we go into next year, I think we will have excess cash and again we leave our options open, but we are going to have a very well crafted balance sheet.","Rick Beckwitt","Alan, just as a point of reference, my good friend, Stuart, made my screensaver our debt maturity ladder and I am trying to figure out how to change it.","Alan Ratner","Got it. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Yes, thank you very much guys. Hi, congratulations and boy, so many things to talk about, which I guess is good. I just wanted to follow-up on Alan\u2019s question about land if I could. Rick in your answer to his question about land and your intentions going forward, you use a couple of phrases that are interesting, you said interesting structures trying to create something special and a dramatic change is likely in 2019. So I just want to follow-up on that and trying to make sure that I am understanding what you are saying, because options are not a new structure in the industry? So could you give us some hint as to what aspect of the deals and arrangements you are looking into is particularly interesting or special and when you said dramatic changes likely in 2019, was that referring to dramatic changes in, let\u2019s say, land spend as a percentage of revenues or something else?","Rick Beckwitt","Stephen, I don\u2019t want to going into a lot of detail, because there is a lot of conversations going on right now and with some developers, capital sources internally within our organization, but our stated objective is to do two things, number one is increase our returns and number two, become more efficient in how we utilize our cash. With that in mind, the natural end result would be to increase in some sort of programmatic structure, our just-in-time ability to close on land. So, those are the touch points that, Stuart, Jon and I are focused on and we are all over it to figure out and create something that gets us those objectives.","Jon Jaffe","And the one piece that Rick left out was increase cash flow.","Rick Beckwitt","Correct.","Stephen Kim","Alright, excellent. I am going to leave others to sort of follow-up on the cash flow point, because I am sure they will. I wanted to jump if I could to Stuart, your commentary about technology and Open Door as I imagine you probably expect I would, I was very intrigued to hear what you had to say about that, because obviously I share your enthusiasm about what can happen there. But I was wondering if you could talk specifically about your investments across these technology initiatives, you said, they weren\u2019t just investments but rather a strategy. The last I recall when we visited you down in Miami, you talk a lot about how your vision for harnessing these innovations was to try to improve the new home industry\u2019s premium that it garners over existing homes, which I thought was very interesting. I was curious if you could talk about whether that vision also includes the ability for Lennar specifically to benefit from a competitive advantage in any material way from the things that you have invested in thus far?","Stuart Miller","Well, that\u2019s a lot of questions. And first of all, Steve, I want to say thank you for hearing and listening to what we are talking about in technology, because it\u2019s not easy for everybody to get their head around it and there are some of the elements of our initiatives that are more about our customer interface, others that are more oriented towards the product offering that we have, many have heard and asked about the Amazon relationship and home automation that we have included in and perhaps most importantly, our Wi-Fi certification that we include. So, our technology initiatives are very, very focused on identifying technologies that can alter our landscape. Altering our landscape can mean reducing our own internal SG&A or cost of building homes, some of those are going to be like Open Door. The Open Door technology has enabled us to bring our cost of customer acquisition down and has furthered our initiatives in those arenas. We are working on technologies in and around building construction. Those technologies will help in terms of construction technique and enable a more efficient delivery system and production system and reduce cycle time. We are also working with technologies around the inclusions in our home. Wi-Fi certification is really all about Wi-Fi distribution through the home from wall-to-wall floor-to-ceiling, no dead spots, no speed loss. That\u2019s a big differentiator between the existing home and the new home. The new homes advantage is that we can be enabled for seamless Wi-Fi distribution. We know we can bring the internet to the home, but distributing it through the home is where everybody is running around with their phone looking for that hotspot that works best and we can heat map and engineer our homes to have seamless Wi-Fi distribution that it enables future technologies in an agnostic way. Right now, we are working with Amazon, but we want to be enabled for all platforms.","At the end of the day, we believe that our technology initiatives which are not as you know about shiny objects and a lot of hype, they are about execution and building a better mousetrap, they will enable us to drive our costs down both at the SG&A level and at the production level and improve our product offerings to our customer, which will differentiate the new home market from the existing market and I think with our aptitude and drive towards technologies and their inclusions will separate Lennar from other homebuilders. We are very enthusiastic about this and I think the single most important differentiating component of Lennar versus other builders is our ability to disseminate. We have built lines of communication out to our divisions to disseminate new initiatives out to the field and get them adapted and adopted in orderly fashion so that we can reap the benefits of those new technologies and improve our margins, our customer interface, and our product offering.","Stephen Kim","That\u2019s great. Appreciate it. Do you actually have specific targets or goals, let\u2019s say, for next year with respect to any of these initiatives?","Stuart Miller","So, Steve, hype would tell us to put out a number that\u2019s exciting and market moving. The reality is that change happens in basis points and 10 basis point increments quarter by quarter and a piece at a time. We have internal targets, but to try to articulate them for the outside world. The road is bumpy and we are respectful. It\u2019s all about execution. And I think directionally you will see improvement in terms of goal setting, I don\u2019t think we want to get out over our skis.","Stephen Kim","Okay, thanks very much. Thanks.","Stuart Miller","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hey, guys. Thank you for fitting me in here. You are clearly executing at a really high level and that\u2019s certainly encouraging, but the market is much more concerned at this point, interest rates affordability in the cycle. So what I just want to be really clear on, are you seeing anything, anything at all that would suggest that higher rates, higher home prices are negatively impacting demand and are you seeing any evidence that the best days of this cycle are behind us at this point?","Rick Beckwitt","So, let me start, it\u2019s Rick. We are still seeing good solid traffic in our communities. We are still seeing ability by our customers to qualify for homes across all price points. We have not seen a movement to a variable rate product on the mortgage side, which is generally the first sign that there is affordability issues, so while there is a lot of focus in the press on rates going up, we got to keep in mind, as Stuart said in his opening comments, that wage growth is real and it\u2019s happening out there. Confidence is solid. So we put all those things together and look at the headlines we operate our business and the business is strong.","John Lovallo","Okay, that\u2019s exactly what I wanted to hear. And then as a follow-up there is a huge disconnect at least in our opinion with where your stock is trading and where it should be trading. I mean, if you would share that view or if you do share that view, I mean and I understand that you want to de-lever I understand your focus on that, but why not just put a big authorization out and just buy the heck out of the stock?","Rick Beckwitt","Look, I think that we are very stay straight with the Street on what our strategy is, we are not trying to send signals or anything else. We made a significant acquisition, strategic combination with CalAtlantic and our first order of business was integration and operations, our second order of business was cash flow and rightsizing our balance sheet. In sequence, we will we will continue to generate cash flow, I have highlighted that we are focused on orderly cash flow from operations, enhancing that cash flow cash flow by reverting to our core business, enhancing that cash flow through land strategy. And as we have excess, then we will articulate what the strategies are for the deployment of capital at that time. So we just want to be straight, we don\u2019t want to send out signals and stuff like that. Our focus right now was on rightsizing the balance sheet and operating this business and I think we are at the top of our game.","John Lovallo","Very helpful. Thank you guys.","Rick Beckwitt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Rick Beckwitt","Good morning, Mike. Are you there?","Operator","Again, Michael Rehaut, your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Yes, I am here. Can you hear me?","Rick Beckwitt","There we go.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. I wasn\u2019t on mute, don\u2019t know what happened there. Anyway, what I was about to say was good afternoon now and congrats on the results. First, just looking at demand from another perspective and appreciate all your comments on that already. I just wanted to confirm, I believe Diane reaffirmed the order growth or order numbers for 3Q and 4Q. As part of that original guidance you had given pro forma kind of organic, I guess pro forma for CalAtlantic I believe 2Q with a 3% number and I don\u2019t have amount of the office don\u2019t have 3Q and 4Q, but just wanted to know what the pro forma was for 2Q and if it\u2019s part of the reiteration for 3Q and 4Q those pro forma numbers are still the same as well?","Diane Bessette","Mike, I am just trying to understand the number. So, are you asking those pro forma for Q3 and Q4 are still the same right and they are still compared to the reaffirmation that that I made a few minutes ago.","Rick Beckwitt","I think the way to think about it is that the beat in Q2 is additive to the year.","Diane Bessette","It\u2019s not taking away from the third and fourth quarter.","Michael Rehaut","Right. I think you had given a 3% pro forma guidance number for 2Q and I just wanted to know if that is what indeed you reported if there was upside to that, because the full number of 62% growth was above our 55% estimate?","Rick Beckwitt","So maybe I will answer that. We were about depending on how you look at 8% to 10% above the prior year pro forma number and the balance of the year based on the pro forma that we gave you in the schedule that we released when we did our last call. Q3 was projected to be up about 12% and Q4 was projected to be up about 7%. And as Stuart said notwithstanding the fact that we sold and delivered more homes in Q2, because we guided to a 3% number, we are maintaining our Q3 and Q4 guidance.","Michael Rehaut","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, Rick. I think also just on clarification on demand before I get to my second question. I think you had alluded to from an affordability standpoint that you haven\u2019t seen any difference between price points. I was just curious affordability aside just from a basic demand trend and observational standpoint, if you are noticing any areas of relative strength or weakness by demographic or price point segment or geography?","Jon Jaffe","It\u2019s Jon. As I said earlier, we are really seeing because of the economic conditions strength across the platforms, where you have entry level product and pricing, there is this very strong demand where you have a move-up product in 8 locations, there is very strong demand. I think maybe give you a couple of data points to sort of besides what we are seeing that underlies the demand and our view forward that, that demand is still strong is that we see most of our lead generation start on the internet and lennar.com. And in the second quarter, the traffic on lennar.com was up 50% year-over-year to $4.5 million and that turned into leads, which means people ask me for specific information about communities that was up 43% year-over-year to over 170,000 leads for the quarter. So, there is really good clarity that there is strength and demand across the entire platform. And of course you have higher velocity at a lower price point than a move-up product, but in the markets where we have the move-up products we are still seeing exceptional demand.","Michael Rehaut","That\u2019s great, Jon. Thank you for that. I guess just second question going back to your comments, Rick, regarding land how you are going to be purchasing land going forward in the different types of conversations you are having with land developers, which is of course very important and great to hear particularly again leveraging your size and increased strength in the marketplace. I was curious if any of those conversations or your strategic approach to this more broadly is inclusive of your current-owned lot position given that, I believe, Diane had reported at quarter end that you are about I guess roughly 75% owned, almost 200,000 lots of your 261 owned, if there is any kind of thought towards moving some of that own position to any of your land developer partners in a greater effort to become more capital efficient?","Rick Beckwitt","What I would like to do is I\u2019d like to put a thought on this and come back to it at another time. What we are doing as a company right now is really evaluating what as I said earlier how we can increase returns and maximize cash flow. And so there is a lot of conversations going on that will evolve over the next year. And I would like to really address that when and if that happens.","Michael Rehaut","Okay, fair enough. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Rick Beckwitt","Thank you. Okay, last question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Buck Horne","Hey, thanks. It\u2019s Buck. Quick question just on pricing power during the quarter, just wondering if you could tell us roughly what percentage of communities you were able to raise price in during the quarter and if you held back on that a little bit because of the integration of sales effort at CalAtlantic?","Rick Beckwitt","So, we don\u2019t really track that kind of information, because the pricing and the price increases happen at the local level on the division by division really community by community basis. But what I will say is you look at the Case-Shiller Index that came out this morning, it was up comfortably year-over-year April over April. I think it\u2019s almost 7%. I think that pricing power, pricing pressure continues to exist as supply is really constrained and demand continues to come to market. I think Jon did a good job of highlighting that demand is strong and even advanced demand relative to the traffic that we are getting on our website is a real good indicator if the traffic continues to build against a really constrained supply.","Buck Horne","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And last one is just on the multifamily division, just wondering any updated thoughts about the longer term prospects of the business in terms if you think you are going to hold it next to the core homebuilding operation, there is obviously a wall of private equity money that\u2019s trying to still get invested in multifamily, has that evolved your thinking about the right time to move multifamily outside the cord?","Stuart Miller","We are just so proud of the multifamily programs that has been put together I think that we highlighted or Diane highlighted, $9.5 billion in production. We have a very attractive platform and a core strategy of reverting to core, whether that happens, we certainly have not engaged process at this point, because we still think there is some maturity to be had, but we are openly thinking about how that will evolve and expect after to mature over the next year or so.","Rick Beckwitt","But the thing that we are very focused on is when you are doing \u2013 when you are involved in construction of about 10,000 apartment homes a year. That gives us additional synergies with regard to cost and maturities. So, it\u2019s core to a large degree and we need to just really focus on the evolution of that business.","Buck Horne","That\u2019s perfect. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Congratulations.","Rick Beckwitt","Okay. So, for those who are still with us, I know we went over a little bit in time. We are really pleased with how things are progressing. We look forward to continued success. Just in conclusion, I will say once again, it all comes down to people. We thank the associates of the company, our trade partners, people across our platform, that\u2019s what makes it happen and we look forward to reporting again in third quarter. See you then.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart Miller","Great. Good morning and thank you. This morning, I'm here with Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer; Jon Jaffee, our President; Diane Bessette, Chief Financial Officer; and David Collins, who you just heard from. We're out in California today with our Board. We have our Board Meeting tomorrow, but we're touring our Board on some of our properties out in California, showing them what makes us the company that we are.","I'm going to start today with a brief overview. Rick and Jon are going to give some additional operational remarks, and Diane will deliver further detail on our third quarter numbers as well as some additional guidance for the remainder of this year. As always, when we get to Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible.","So, let me go ahead and begin by saying that we're very pleased to report a very strong third quarter performance that reflects both the continued recovery in the housing market as well as continued focus on leveraging our size and scale and delivering greater cash flow and higher returns.","Our results reflect the fact that the housing market continued to strengthen throughout the third quarter, confirming and continuing the trend that we reported in our earnings call last quarter. The market for new homes has been improving from last year's pause as lower interest rates have stimulated demand and improved affordability, while the overall fundamentals of the economy have remained strong.","We clearly saw traffic and sales continue to strengthen in the third quarter, as a combination of lower interest rates together with slower price appreciation have positively impacted affordability. And that together with low unemployment, wage growth, consumer confidence, and economic growth drove the consumer to return to a more affordable housing market. ","Current market conditions are strong, and they've been continuing to improve as the production deficit driven short supply, lower interest rates, and attractive pricing have motivated consumers. In the third quarter, we achieved strong net earnings of over $513 million or $1.59 per share. This result derived mostly from solid operating results from both Homebuilding and Financial Services.","In Homebuilding, stronger sales drove, and are driving, stronger than expected deliveries at stabilized margin levels of 20.4%, the high-end of our guidance as incentives have moderated. While deliveries jumped 7% over last year and new orders improved 9% over last year, our size and scale in most of the best markets in the country enabled us to offset the impact of rising land costs with production cost savings and overhead leverage, which has driven our SG&A to an all-time third quarter low of 8.3%. And we're confident that these trends are going to continue into the fourth quarter.","Our Financial Services performance also contributed to our earnings beat, and I want to focus on this for a couple of minutes as this performance is a proxy for many of the important initiatives driving our company today. At the beginning of the quarter, we expected the contribution from this segment to be approximately $54 million. By the end of the current quarter, our Financial Services segment generated a record quarterly profit of $78.8 million or an improvement of about 45% from our expectations.","It's noteworthy that having sold our retail mortgage component, our retail title component and our retail home insurance agency, we no longer drive additional volume from spikes in the mortgage refi business that has been booming as rates have gone down. We are only producing from our core business.","While some of this beat derives from market conditions, much of the performance story from this segment is about shedding non-core assets, which enables our management team to focus on the core homebuilding-oriented business and implement new technologies to streamline the remaining business process, all while improving our customers' experience. This core focus drove significant operational improvement versus the prior year with fewer assets deployed as follows.","First, we increased the company's combined mortgage capture rate from 71% to 77%, having integrated the CalAtlantic business, which had much lower capture rates than where Lennar historically operated. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we've reduced the cost to originate a loan by 22% from $7,700 per loan to approximately $6,000 per loan, and this is a continuation of the operational improvements, which have now driven the origination costs down 33% from $9,000 per loan in 2017.","And then third, we've reduced the total Financial Services associate headcount by over 50% from approximately 3,700 associates with the announcement of CalAtlantic to now below 1,600 associates. The technology initiatives implemented include robotic processes to automate repetitive detail-oriented tasks that eliminate human error and manual intervention. These initiatives are helping our journey to reduce paper flow, streamline the closing process, and drive a friendlier customer experience. Technology, together with management focus, has enabled efficiency, a better customer experience, and a much better bottom line.","Our management team has been focused on incorporating new technologies on our old operating chassis to both drive down costs and to create significantly better customer experience in mortgage with our Blend partnership, in title and escrow services with our States Title partnership, and home insurance with our Hippo insurance partnership. ","And although ultimately, we will improve our entire end-to-end process to get to a one-tap closing, we're really starting to see the fruits of our focus and investment at the bottom line right now. And these improvements specifically and these types of improvements generally are sustainable and will continue to drive bottom line improvement in our Financial Services segment and across our company in the future.","Moving on, while strong operating results drove the bottom line, our overall focus on inventory, land spend, and shedding non-core assets has driven a strong and improving cash flow picture as well. First, we are reducing our overall inventory levels as we have had a relentless focus on our pivot to land-lighter strategy. From the timing of land purchases to the duration of the land that we buy to the percentage of optioned versus owned land, we are migrating towards a significantly smaller land inventory driving our business forward.","Second, we are also driving our asset base lower as we continue to focus on monetizing non-core assets and migrating to a core, pure play homebuilding and financial services platform. As noted, we have shed various non-core Financial Services assets this year. We continue to divest and monetize various remnant Rialto assets, and we're working on finding proper positioning for other ancillary businesses as well, and the latter will happen as quickly as is practical.","With that said, strong operating results together with our focus on overall inventory reduction has increased our expected cash flow for this year to $1.5 billion and projected annual cash flow expectations for 2020 are continuing to head towards the $2 billion mark. Our strong cash flow and strong cash position enables us to repay $500 million of debt at the beginning of the quarter, while also opportunistically repurchasing another 6 million shares of stock at an average price of about $48.5 a share through the quarter, and we will pay off another $600 million of debt from cash flow right at year-end.","At quarter-end, we had a debt-to-total cap ratio of approximately 37%, which is a 300-basis point improvement over last year. And while we're not giving specific guidance for 2020 at this time, we're very optimistic about the prospects for next year. Accordingly, we expect to generate strong cash flow for the remainder of 2019 and expect to continue to use excess cash flow to both pay down debt, while we continue to opportunistically repurchase stock.","We expect to see our margins improve steadily throughout the remainder of the year as prices remain stable and incentives continue to subside and ensure that we achieve our 2019 closing target of now approximately 51,000 homes. We are confident that we'll achieve this target, which frankly would have been higher except for the hurricane activity that slowed production at the end of the quarter.","Before I turn over to Rick, Jon and Diane, let me just say that we remain encouraged by both Lennar's position and market conditions for the remainder of the year. Our size and scale in each of our strategic market continues to facilitate the management of costs and production in a land and labor constrained market. Our focus on technology is driving efficiency that is reflected in our consistent improvement in SG&A and our bottom line. Our strong cash flow and bottom-line profitability are continuing to enable us to reduce debt and return capital to shareholders.","Our strong balance sheet continues to improve and position us for the future. And our strategy of shedding noncore assets continues to drive an intensified focus on our core homebuilding and financial services businesses. As the homebuilding market continues to improve in the wake of the recent pause, we are optimistic about our ability to deliver strong and consistent performance for the remainder of 2019 and into 2020.","With that, let me turn over to the rest of the team. Rick?","Rick Beckwitt","Thanks, Stuart. We had a strong quarter, driven by solid execution of our operating strategy. Homebuilding revenues for the third quarter totaled $5.4 billion, representing a 3% increase from 2018. This was driven by a 7% increase in deliveries to 13,522 homes and a 5% decrease in average sales price. Deliveries for the quarter exceeded the high-end of our guidance as we were able to accelerate some fourth quarter closings into the third quarter as buyers took advantage of lower mortgage rates.","Our gross margin for the quarter totaled 20.4%, which was just shy of the top side of our prior guidance and up 30 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. This sequential improvement benefited from direct cost savings and was slightly impacted by an increase in the number of closings coming from lower margin third party option contracts versus land we've developed. This is in line with our land lighter strategy that is focused on maximizing cash flow and internal rates of return. I will discuss this in greater detail in a bit.","Our SG&A in the quarter was 8.3%. This marks an all-time third quarter low and highlights the power of our increased local market scale and operating leverage. Homebuilding operating earnings totaled $659 million, up 8% from the prior year, and net earnings for the quarter totaled $513 million, up 13% from 2018.","New orders for the quarter increased 9% to 13,369 homes, exceeding the high-end of our Q3 guidance. New orders increased in each of our Homebuilding segments with August being the strongest month in the period. From a dollar value perspective, new orders totaled $5.2 billion, which was up 3% from the prior year.","Our average new order sales price declined 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, reflecting our continued focus on the strong entry level market. The entry level market now accounts for about 40% of our business, and this will continue to increase as more first-time buyer communities come online and increase our overall community count in 2020.","During our third quarter, we saw increased demand which benefited from lower mortgage rates and increased homebuyer sentiment. Our sales pace per community increased 10% year-over-year. We continue to experience solid traffic on both our website and at our Welcome Home Centers and are optimistic that sales will continue to be strong in Q4. We ended the third quarter with a sales backlog of 18,908 homes, with a dollar value of $7.6 billion. This backlog, combined with our current housing inventory, puts us in a great position to close about 51,000 homes in fiscal 2019.","As we look forward to 2020, we are laser-focused on improving our returns on capital and generating significant cash flow. With this in mind, increasing our percentage of option homesites and reducing the amount of owned home sites are top priorities. At the beginning of this year, we set a two-year goal of having 40% of our homesites controlled via options and similar arrangements.","We made great strides on this front in the third quarter as our percentage improved from 25% to 30%. This increase reflects the strength of our relationship with local developers and their desire to work with us to increase our option position, given our size and scale in our markets. We expect to continue to expand on our existing relationships and enter new regional and national land platforms over the next 12 months. Based on this, we are now increasing our goal of controlled homesites to between 40% to 50% of our land needs.","During the third quarter, we also made progress reducing our years owned supply of homesites from 4.5 years to 4.4 years and continue to target a goal of three years. As we reach these two goals, it will enable us to reduce our on-balance sheet land spend and purchase homesites on a takedown basis much closer to the start of the home. This will generate additional cash flow and drive meaningfully greater returns.","Consistent with our land-light strategy and focus on increasing returns, we are continuing to develop a program to address the single-family rental market. There is no question that there is a shortage of affordable and workforce housing, and new single-family rental communities can help solve this problem. Given this shortage, there is intense investor interest in new single-family rental communities where the owner can leverage the overhead costs of managing the rentals because they're all the same community with identical features from home to home and Lennar is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.","Last quarter we highlighted our single-family rental program where our homebuilding operation is building and selling homes in bulk in a community on land owned by a third party with no lease-up risk to Lennar. We love this expansion of our core business as it allows us to leverage our homebuilding machine and existing overhead, and it will generate high returns and profits, all with no accompanying land or lease-up risk. This is a perfect expansion of our land-light strategy.","And given our strong relationship with landowners and developers and our low cost and speed of construction, we are optimistic that we can increase deliveries in the next couple of years. Additionally, this program provides an interesting and unique hedge to our for-sale business.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jon.","Jon Jaffe","Thanks, Rick. Today I want to speak about our focus on cost reduction across our platform. First, I'll discuss our significant size and scale that led to Lennar becoming the builder of choice, resulting in reduced direct construction costs and advantageous cycle times.","With respect to direct construction costs, I mentioned on our last earnings call that we looked forward at the next few quarters and saw that directionally our direct construction costs were decreasing. This bore out in our third quarter as we saw our direct costs were down sequentially from Q2 by $0.99 per square foot or 1.6%. From a year-over-year perspective, our direct costs were up just 3%. This represents the lowest rate of year-over-year increase in 11 quarters and compares favorably to a year-over-year rate of 7% just last quarter.","We have visibility into the continuation of this trend over the next few quarters as we review the direct costs for homes delivered in Q3 by the quarterly cohort that the homes were started in. Looking at these sequential cohorts, it's very clear that our direct costs are trending down over each subsequent quarter and will contribute positively to our gross margins going forward.","Sequentially, in Q3 our material costs were down 3.5% from Q2. Significantly, over 65% of our material cost line items were lower sequentially, with the biggest declines coming from lumber, drywall and exterior finishes. As I've previously discussed, lumber represent the largest single cost item at approximately 13% of total direct costs. Lumber reached its low in December 2018 and has since remained in a range averaging about $350 per 1,000 board feet.","On the labor side of costs, the severity of the labor shortage in the construction industry has not abated, but our labor costs moved up just 1% sequentially in Q3 over Q2. We see across all of our markets that our Builder of Choice focus is playing out to allow Lennar to minimize the impacts of this labor shortage. Some real-time examples of this as we have national and regional manufacturers struggling with critical labor shortages and supply interruptions.","In three separate situations, these suppliers, who are strategic partners of Lennar, are flying in crews and materials from other regions of the country to complete the work on Lennar communities. These are a few examples demonstrating that our size and scale allow us to get above and beyond responses to rectify issues. This is further evidence of our ability to attract trades to our job sites away from other builders, enabling Lennar to have significant cycle time advantages. Size and scale, combined with even flow production in our everything's included platform provides a consistent, predictable volume for our trades.","Let me now turn to SG&A for a moment. Given our significant size and scale, we are leveraging our overhead with a focus on simplifying all of our operations, systems and processes to allow our associates to operate more efficiently. We continue to gain operating leverage through simplifying our systems, processes and procedures. As a result, our associates have become significantly more efficient and productive, resulting in our year-over-year personnel spending flat where our volume increased by 7%.","We continue to leverage technology to reduce our customer acquisition cost spend by sourcing higher quality online customer leads. Our focus is on the quality of our internet leads, not just quantity. Through rigorous A\/B testing of digital marketing strategies and tactics, we deliver higher quality leads to our internet sales team. The result is, our internet leads defined as someone who request specific information and give us their contact information are up 50% over last year. The resulting high volume of high-quality leads reduces realtor spend and delivers more volume across the fixed costs of our sales platform.","I will conclude by echoing what you heard from both Stuart and Rick. We are laser-focused on improving our net operating margin, free cash flow, and return on capital. To achieve these goals, our program is simple: maximize efficiency; be land-light; have everything's included even flow production, with sales matched to the production pace; drive direct costs down through strategic Builder of Choice partnerships; and use technology and leverage to reduce our SG&A.","Now, I'll turn it over to Diane.","Diane Bessette","Thank you, Jon, and good morning to everyone. So, let me summarize and reemphasize a few points from our third quarter and starting with Homebuilding. So, looking at deliveries, you've heard that our deliveries increased 7% from the prior year and exceeded the upper range of June guidance by 2% as we benefited from a favorable interest rate environment.","Our third quarter gross margin on home sales was 20.4%, which was at the higher end of our June guidance. The prior year's gross margin was 20.3%, including CalAtlantic's purchase accounting, and 21.9%, excluding purchase accounting. Q3 2019 gross margins were impacted by lower average sales prices as we strategically repositioned our product to target more first-time homebuyers and lower-priced homes.","Gross margin was also impacted by an increase of 60 basis points in sales incentives year-over-year. So, incentives decreased sequentially by 30 basis points. Additionally, while construction costs were up 3% year-over-year, there was a decrease sequentially of 1.6% as we realized the benefits of our size and scale.","Our third quarter SG&A was 8.3%, which is the lowest third quarter SG&A percent we have ever achieved, and was at the lower end of our June guidance. This compared to 8.5% in the prior year. The improvement, as Jon mentioned, was primarily a result of continued operating leverage due to size and scale in our markets and our focus on technology initiatives.","Turning to new orders. New orders increased 9% from the prior year and exceeded the upper range of June guidance by 4%. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 16%. And then looking at absorptions, absorption for the third quarter was 3.4 versus 3.1 in the prior year, and we ended the quarter with about 1,300 active communities.","And finally, for Homebuilding joint venture land sales and the Other categories, we had a combined earnings of $18 million, compared to a $3 million loss in the prior year. The current quarter primarily benefited from $12 million of gross profit on land sales and also 12 million [earnings] of other income, largely related to the sale of two club houses, both as a result of our continued focus on cash generation, and this was partially offset by about $10 million of losses from our joint ventures.","Now turning to Financial Services. So, looking at the results in total, operating earnings were a record 79 million, net of noncontrolling interests compared to 61 million in the prior year and the details as follows. Mortgage operating earnings increased to 57 million from 34 million in the prior year, and as you heard us mention, mortgage earnings improved primarily due to a higher capture rate of increased Lennar deliveries, as well as reductions in loan origination costs, driven in part by technology initiatives. These items more than offset the decrease in retail origination volume as a result of the sale of substantially all of our retail mortgage business in Q1 of 2019.","Title operating earnings were 18 million, compared to 22 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to the sale of the majority of our retail agency business and title insurance underwriter business to States Title in Q1 of 2019, which resulted in a 56% decrease in title revenue. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in captive closed orders and a decrease in operating expenses.","Rialto Mortgage Finance operating earnings were consistent with the prior year at about $4 million. A decrease in securitization dollar volume was offset by an increase in securitization margins. And then turning to Multifamily. Our Multifamily segment had operating earnings of $11 million, net of noncontrolling interests, compared to a loss of 4 million in the prior year.","There was one building sale this quarter that resulted in the segment's $13 million share of gains, compared to one sale in the prior year that resulted in the segment's $2 million share of gains. And then on the Lennar Other category. This is the category for the legacy Rialto assets outside of Rialto Mortgage Finance and our strategic technology investments. Earnings were $16 million in this quarter, compared to $10 million in the prior year, and this was largely driven by higher earnings related to the Rialto fund investments that we've retained.","And then finally looking at our tax rate. Our tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%, which was lower than our guidance of 25.5%, primarily due to energy credits that our team was able to generate this quarter.","And then turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $795 million of cash, and at the end of the quarter our homesites owned and controlled were 310,000 of which 70% are owned and 30% are controlled, which is an improvement, as Rick mentioned, from 25% controlled in the prior quarter. And as we've said, our year's supply owned decreased sequentially from 4.5 to 4.4.","Land acquisition spend during the quarter was 691 million and land development was 645 million. We had borrowings on our revolving credit facility of 700 million, leaving 1.7 billion of available capacity. During the quarter, we retired 500 million senior notes due in June, and since the acquisition, as Stuart mentioned, of CalAtlantic, we've retired 1.6 billion of senior notes.","As we mentioned during the quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares of stock for a total of 295 million, and this brings our repurchase activity to 8.1 million shares or 395 million so far this year. At the end of the quarter, our homebuilding debt to total cap ratio was 37.1, which improved 100 basis points from the prior year and 120 basis points sequentially. Stockholders' equity increased to 15.4 billion and our book value per share grew to [$48.40] per share.","So, now turning to guidance. I'd like to give a little bit of guidance for the fourth quarter. Starting with Homebuilding. We expect new orders to be between 12,200 and 12,400. We expect to deliver between 18,500 and 16,000 homes. This estimate includes the impact of the hurricane that Stuart mentioned, as well as the acceleration of deliveries into Q3 that Rick referenced.","We expect our Q4 average sales price to be between $385,000 and $390,000. We expect our Q4 gross margin to be in the range of 21.25% to 21.5%, and our SG&A to be in the range of 7.7% to 7.8%. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we expect a loss \u2013 a Q4 loss of approximately 20 million.","Turning to Financial Services. We believe our Financial Services earnings will be between $68 million and $70 million. We believe our Multifamily segment will be about breakeven, and for the other category related to the Rialto legacy assets and our strategic investments, we expect Q4 deliveries to be between $5 million and $10 million.","We expect our corporate G&A to be about 1.4% of total revenues, and we expect our tax rate to be about 25.5%. The weighted average share count for Q4 should be about 317 million shares, and this estimate does not include any additional share repurchases that we might opportunistically pursue. This guidance should produce an EPS range of $1.81 to $1.94.","In summary, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate strong profitability, increased cash flow, and improved returns for the balance of 2019 and continuing into 2020.","And now, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","It is now time for the question-and-answer session for today's call. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.","Trey Morrish","This is actually Trey on for Steve. So, first I wanted to ask little about on the orders front. The West, Central in your Texas region, all were pretty good, up 10% or more, but the East appeared to be lagging a bit. Is there something unique in that geography or is there something a little bit more comp related that was more difficult in the quarter? We\u2019re just wondering what's kind of going on there.","Rick Beckwitt","In the year ago period, we had a lot of new communities open in the quarter, and we had a pretty strong sales period in the year ago. There is nothing going on that's abnormal or unusual. I feel that the Eastern markets are strong across the board.","Trey Morrish","Okay. And then you highlighted this quarter that your closings benefited from pull-forward deliveries due to lower rates, and it's also something you talked about last quarter as well. I'm just wondering, is that something that is included \u2013 or that dynamic, is that included in your fourth quarter guide or is that something that could again ultimately be a little bit of upside to your numbers?","Rick Beckwitt","Yes, I think with regard to the acceleration of people's desire to close, when rates move people lock, and they don't want to lose the opportunity, and we just saw some people do that in the third quarter. And if there is a similar phenomenon in Q4, then we'd expect something like that as well, but we haven't put that in our guidance.","Trey Morrish","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Next question comes from Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Ivy Zelman","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. So, it's been almost two years \u2013 roughly two years since you initially announced the acquisition of CalAtlantic, and I thought it might be helpful maybe you can share with us with respect to the aspects of the integration where you've been most pleasantly surprised, and were there other areas that you still think there are untapped opportunities that you can capitalize on with the dominant scale that you have. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Jon Jaffe","Ivy, it's Jon. I'd say, most pleasantly surprised with how quickly and smoothly the integration went across the entire platform. So, to me, it's not one particular area that stands out, but everyone very quickly was on the same page. There was no confusion about do you turn left or right, and a very quick transition to everything's included out in the communities to have our consumer-facing front all on the same page. Same thing as you look across our internet, digital marketing platform, same thing as you look across our land acquisition discipline. Everybody really is in lockstep pulling in the same direction, and I'd say that's what we're most pleased about.","Rick Beckwitt","I guess I'd add to that, Ivy. We had always assumed and expected that given the increase in scale and size in our markets that that would be a significant advantage. And if anything, we underestimated the benefit of that. And it really comes from all aspects of the business, access to labor, our cost structure, and really on the land side.","Stuart Miller","I think that \u2013 look, I think that the most remarkable part of two years \u2013 just two years passing since that announcement, and no disrespect intended, we don't even talk about the acquisition anymore. We are one Lennar, we're one company, and the vestiges of integration, things like that are far behind us. I think that as one company, we are focused on using our size and scale to really leverage every aspect of our business. You hear about it a lot relative to land, you hear about it a lot relative to production costs, and you see a lot of leverage in SG&A, and all of those components are being driven by the fact that we've got size and scale and a fully integrated program as one company, unified program.","Ivy Zelman","That's very helpful and sounds awesome, and hopefully there\u2019s a lot more to come from the scale and your dominant position. Moving to one aspect of it with land, Rick, maybe this is for you, just to \u2013 with respect to the regional land developers that you've partnered with, I think you've talked publicly about three. Some of the clients I was chatting with at our Housing Summit, we\u2019re talking about why is it any different than another builder who is optioning lots from a land developer. And I thought it'd be helpful, one, if you can talk about and expand it upon the three, and why is it an advantage, the relationship you have, because I think you own a portion of those companies, maybe elaborate on that, Rick, if you would.","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. I think the key differential is, people that we're working with are experts in going through the entitlements and really finding great pieces of properties that are a game-changer. And if you think about our core business, as a builder we don't want to really play in the entitlement space. So, these are regional folks that \u2013 this is what they do. They find opportunities before anybody else can, and we've worked with them to expand our land platform and we have expanded them into other geographies, and it's working effectively.","Jon Jaffe","Ivy, it's Jon. I'd interject that the strategic relationships, the differential between what you hear from other builders, I believe is that these are long-term ongoing relationships that will continue to produce opportunities for us over time as compared to one-off auction transactions with a developer doing a single parcel.","Ivy Zelman","Got it. Very helpful. Good luck, guys. Tanks for taking our questions.","Operator","Next question comes from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Truman Patterson","Hi. Good morning, everybody, and nice results. First, just wanted to touch on order incentives. Could you just discuss how they trended through the quarter? Possibly the magnitude of the improvement from 2Q to 3Q? And I realize it might be difficult to parse out numerically, but could you just discuss qualitatively how incentives trended by segment entry level and move up?","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. We didn't have too much variability among the months in the quarter. And as we've always said, we're really focused on net pricing and focused on maximizing the value of our inventory and turning inventory. Our key focus, as Stuart, Jon, and Diane and I have said is, we're very focused on return on investment. And so net margin is really what we're focused on.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Okay. Thank you for that. When I'm looking out a year or so, I'm really trying to hope to understand where your growth will likely come from community count absorptions. You're starting to replace your move-up communities with higher absorbing entry level communities. Will that just lead to very modest community count improvement \u2013 I believe you alluded to it on the call previously and growth will primarily come through increased absorptions? Or do you think you have enough owned land that you can really liquidate it and grow communities regardless kind of a decent rate in 2020, call it like a mid-single-digit clip?","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. We're expecting to see community count growth going into 2020 progressing through the year. And with our focus on the entry level and lower priced market, absorptions are going to be stronger given the fact that there is higher velocity in the entry level market.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Next question comes from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Lovallo","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. First one. I believe last year you provided delivery margin and SG&A outlook for 2019 during the third quarter. Is there any reason why you guys decided not to do that today?","Stuart Miller","There is no specific reason. We just traditionally give guidance for the following year in the fourth quarter. Last year, we made a decision strategically to accelerate that, and we've just gone back to our normal practice. As I said in my comments, we are optimistic about 2020. It's just a little premature for us to do \u2013 to give specific guidance. And I think that as we have traditionally done in the fourth quarter, we will give the guidance that we normally give.","John Lovallo","Okay. That sounds good. And then in terms of orders, are there any comments, maybe at least directionally, you can give us in terms of September and how that may have trended?","Stuart Miller","Yes. So, historically, we've not given additional guidance past the quarter's end. But as we said in our remarks, the market has been very strong, and it has continued to be improving and I think we'll go about that far. Don't want to set a new standard. But it's clear that the trend through the quarter was positive with August being our most robust month and continuing into the fourth quarter, we're seeing additional strength.","John Lovallo","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Next question comes from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets.","Mike Dahl","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Stuart, maybe just to pick up on that last comment. I think, clearly your business is seeing the strength in the numbers, and it's great to hear the positive commentary. One of the pushbacks we still get to the overall Group is just the broader macro concerns and whether or not these are really seeping into consumer behavior at this point. So, can you give us a little more color on what you're hearing from the field as buyers are balancing \u2013 affordability being restored versus maybe or maybe not being impacted at all by some of the headlines out there?","Stuart Miller","I think that we talk about this a lot. It's easy to get a little confused in today's market. There is a lot of noise in the political scene, and it certainly feels like it's creating crosscurrents. But as we look to the feedback that we're getting real-time from the customers coming to our Welcome Home Centers and talking to us about their thought process, their future, we're still seeing that underpinning the fundamentals of the economy are driving consumer sentiment. And perhaps we are more sensitive to the noise than the actual consumers.","Low unemployment, generally positive job growth, a fairly strong economy, all of these things seem to be driving consumer sentiment more than some of the new stories that we see that seem to be politicized. And so, we're \u2013 as we've noted, we've seen growing strength as we went through our third quarter, and that seems to be the dominant direction. I know that there is a lot of question about upcoming potential recession and things like that. Our customers don't seem to be viewing it that way, and I think that the housing market in general seems solid and strong and continuing to improve.","Mike Dahl","Okay. That's helpful and good to hear. My second question then just specifically with respect to the fourth quarter orders guidance. If we heard it correctly, it sounds fairly robust in terms of the growth there, and there is an easier comp. But just on the question of absorption versus community count, maybe a little more detail \u2013 the comment was made growth in community count into 2020. How should we think about the balance of community count versus absorption within that fourth quarter orders guide specifically?","Stuart Miller","So, look, community count is a very complicated number. It's got a lot of moving parts. So, into the fourth quarter, we're kind of suspecting that our community count is going to be about where we are and we'll see a little bit more absorption. As I noted in my comments, our guidance for the fourth quarter has been moderated by the production slowdown that we saw relative to all the preparation work all the way up the Eastern seaboard that had to take place relative to the hurricane coming through, and that really shut down a few weeks of production. So, our guidance might have been higher had we not had that kind of blip along the way.","In terms of community count, as we look into 2020, I think that what we've probably understated is the really strong relationships that are driving our land strategy overall, all the way from the way that we're migrating from owned to option programs to the access to new communities to the kind of regional and sometimes national relationships that will define the way that we own and hold land and are prepared for growth in the future, these are evolving stories that really come down to very, very strong long-term relationships that have been enhanced by our additional size and scale.","And the two, relationship and size and scale, are working hand-in-hand to give us a great deal of confidence that as we think about community count going into 2020, we are on an upward trajectory, and that's going to define our growth prospects as we go forward.","Mike Dahl","Thanks for the details.","Stuart Miller","You bet.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter. First question. Stuart, I just wanted to expand a little bit on what you just said before regarding the land relationships, the shift toward lot optioning, the ability in sourcing of land and communities going forward, and kind of how that's allowing you to, at least directionally, say you expect to grow community count next year. With the increase of the lot optioning target from 40% to 45%, I guess maybe just asking it perhaps a little bit more bluntly, but number one, I was hoping to get a little bit of a time frame of when you'd hope to achieve that 40% to 45% range? I think in the past the 40% number was a little bit more perhaps over the next couple of years, let's say, or maybe the next 18 months even. If we're still talking about that same time frame, let's say now through the end of next year or even 2021.","And secondly, as part of this question, just on your community count comments and access to land, I believe you had also talked about \u2013 with the overall soft pivot that you've been doing over the last two or three years, most recently kind of a unit volume growth objective of perhaps low-to-mid single digits. I was curious if the enhanced access to land changes that type of growth dynamic that perhaps if you're opening yourselves up to a broader enhanced set of land developers and stronger relationships, if that changes that growth calculus at all?","Stuart Miller","Okay. So, that's a lot of questions embedded in one there, Mike. So, let me see how I can do. Let me start at the end and say that we're really not changing our growth trajectory. We are refining the way that we get there, and we're really using the expanded relationships that we've got and size and scale to moderate our growth. But the access to land that we are \u2013 that we're working on and working with right now really enables us to grow as much as we perhaps want to. But we're constraining that growth in order to do it in the most effective way possible.","And by constraining growth what we're enabling of ourselves is the ability to make that migration from a land-heavier to a land-lighter strategy, which is going to generate very strong cash flows that enable us to manage our balance sheet, our debt levels and our return of capital strategically. So, we're really pretty enthusiastic about that.","Again, the relationships that we have that are long-term relationships, together with the size and scale that we've amassed, gives us a lot of optionality. And we know that we've highlighted a fairly aggressive target in terms of migrating from what was 20% to 25% to 30% option versus owned land relationship to a 40% to 50% level over the next couple of years, and that's an aggressive standard. But when we look at what's in our hopper and the things that we're working on and understand that when this management team focuses on something, we have a lot of tools in our toolbox.","We have people who have deep, rich relationships that we can activate that stuff and make these things happen, and that's what's happening behind the scene. What we have in the hopper right now gives us a pretty good sense and confidence about being able to set high standards and expectations and then deliver on them. That's what you've seen from us in the past. That's what you're going to see from us now.","Michael Rehaut","Great. Thank you, Stuart. I appreciate that. I guess if I could just \u2013 I know this first question multifaceted, but I'll see if I can sneak another one in, if you allow. On the gross margin side, obviously, it's an encouraging guide for the fourth quarter, and you're kind of continuing to see that recovery throughout this year as many builders have, you know coming off of the first half of the year when the industry kind of processed some of the higher incentive levels off the back half of 2018, should we be thinking of kind of the 21% \u2013 the low 21% as kind of a new reset baseline at this point given how the housing market has normalized and incentives have kind of receded off of those higher levels 6 to 12 months ago as we go into 2020?","Stuart Miller","So, look, there are some moving parts in this, and I'm going to let Rick kind of directly answer the question, but I want to highlight one thing first, and that is \u2013 look, land prices generally are and have been moving up. And then the migration toward a land-lighter strategy generally means you're buying more of a retail priced land asset underneath each and every home. What is exciting to us and remarkable is, as Jon properly highlighted, our size and scale is helping us offset some of those natural increases in price with some reductions in our production cost, reductions in our SG&A, to get to a net margin that is really consistent and strong going forward. So, Rick, maybe you'd like to weigh in on the direct margin question.","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. So, Stuart is exactly right. There are a lot of moving pieces with regard to margin as we look at 2020 and 2021. Our focus on increasing returns has an impact on the gross margin. We will be taking land very much closer to the start of construction, and as a result, there is a trade-off between gross margin \u2013 and I've said in the past, it could be 100 basis points, 150 basis points but returns go up exponentially. And we believe that that's an important thing for us to focus on.","In addition, as we move down the price curve, the entry level homes generally have a lower margin, but much, much higher IRRs associated with that. So, when we come to the fourth quarter, we'll give you guidance on where we think we'll be for 2020, but all in all, it will be a really strong profitable year.","Diane Bessette","And hi, Mike, this is Diane. Let me just take a minute why we're talking about the fourth quarter. My apologies. Deliveries for the fourth quarter should be 15,800 to 16,000 homes. So, just wanted to clarify that.","Michael Rehaut","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James.","Buck Horne","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to see if you could just go in a little bit more detail on the single-family rental community platform that you're developing. And is it something that you would envision \u2013 it sounds like you're going to do it without land investment or lease-up risk. But would you actually consider expanding it to buy some land specifically targeted for that type of project? And I guess I'm also curious what kind of addressable \u2013 total addressable market you think is out there for the built for rent product? [Technical Difficulty] Hello? Hello, operator? Operator, you still there? I'm not hearing anything on the line.","Operator","Are you there? Can anybody hear me?","Buck Horne","Hello, operator? Hello? Hello, operator?","Operator","Yes.","Buck Horne","Hi, this is Buck.","Stuart Miller","Hi, Buck. Okay. Good. Do you want to go through your question again? Somehow, we had an audio problem.","Buck Horne","Yes. No worries. No worries. Sorry about that. The question was on the single-family rental community platform. And just curious, it sounds like you're doing this without land investment and without lease-up risk, but would you consider expanding to actually invest in land specifically geared to that type of community? And really just \u2013 the other question is, what kind of total addressable market you think is out there for the built for rent product?","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator?","Stuart Miller","Here we go. I don't know \u2013 still a little spotty. But, listen, I'd say this. I want to make clear that our single-family for rent program is an extension of our core business, and it really isn't asset sensitive extension of that business. That enables us to expand our core business. Without the risk, we're not be coming \u2013 it's not a version of our multifamily business. We're not building a new ancillary business. It's a production-oriented business as an extension of our core.","And additionally, and I think we've highlighted it very well, and that is, one of the biggest problems that we have in the country right now is affordable and workforce housing, and the single-family for rent business is becoming one of the big solutions, and we are part of that solution. We have had intense inquiry from participants who want to build entire communities of single family for rent where we can do it effectively, efficiently and with high returns, and we can participate, though we're not taking either the land risk or the lease-up risk, and this is a really positive program for us. Rick, why don\u2019t you\u2026?","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. Directly to answer your question, our primary focus is doing it in communities that are owned by a third party. That's our highest return on investment. It allows us to leverage our overhead. It allows us to build a very efficient program and build that scale fast. In addition to that, we are looking at doing single-family rental as an additional product offering in some of our existing communities, having a section of the community increase the pace and return on investment in those communities. So, it's going to be a combination of things. But as Stuart said, this is our core business. We're building, selling and closing the homes and doing it fast.","Jon Jaffe","Okay. This is Jon. I just would add one other point to this is \u2013 we have complete optionality since this is the same product as we're building for sale to go whatever direction makes the most sense in terms of meeting the market demand and producing the highest returns for us.","Buck Horne","That's extremely helpful. Thank you, guys. I will drop \u2013 given the audio problems, I'll pass it on to the next one.","Stuart Miller","I don't think it was your fault, Buck. I think it was something on our end, but thanks for your questions.","Buck Horne","Thank you very much.","Stuart Miller","Why don't we take one more? Why don\u2019t we take one more?","Operator","Okay. Last question comes from Matt Bouley from Barclays. Your line is open, sir.","Matt Bouley","Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for fitting me in here. Just back on the entry level mix and the sales pace implications. I think, Rick, you mentioned that you are at about 40% of the business today in terms of entry-level, which kind of looks like where legacy Lennar was pre-CalAtlantic. So just \u2013 and I'll leave it here. This is my only question. As we look at 2020, just, one, kind of any sense of where that entry level mix will be next year based on the communities you've got coming on? And, two, you mentioned the sales pace should improve as a result, but are you actually thinking that you can reach sales pace levels that are accordingly consistent with where legacy Lennar was? Thank you.","Rick Beckwitt","Well, with regard to the mix in 2020, I did say that we'll be \u2013 it'll be a higher percentage of entry-level, probably moves up 2% to 3%, 4%-ish, depending on when those communities come online. We've really targeted across the board a lower price point. You can see it in our sales orders in every geographic segment of the company. And it's primarily being led by Texas and some of the Florida markets. But there is a \u2013 we've really worked on a highly engineered efficient floor plans that we're just rolling out [everywhere].","Stuart Miller","And our single-family for rent program and strategy will add to the change and the migration in that mix. Look, as we come to conclusion here today, let me just say that there are a lot of moving parts in our business that are reflected in the third quarter as all moving in the right direction, and I think that that's what you're hearing from the management team right now is we're enthusiastic about the business, we're enthusiastic about the market, and how it's shaping up as we look toward 2020. And we think that the business is on a really good track to make the changes, to make the programs and position the pieces to really have an exciting year ahead. So, thank you for joining us. We look forward to reporting our fourth quarter.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart Miller","Great. Good morning, everyone, and thank you. This morning, I\u2019m here in Miami with Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer; Jon Jaffee, our President; Diane Bessette, Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Collins, our Controller; and of course, you\u2019ve just heard from Alex.","I\u2019m going to start, as I always do with a brief overview, Jon and Rick are going to give some additional operational remarks, and Diane will deliver further detail on our fourth quarter and year-end numbers, as well as some guidance for our first quarter and our full-year 2020. As always, when we get to our Q&A, we\u2019d like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible.","So let me go ahead and begin by saying that this is another excellent quarter and year-end for the company, as we continue to focus on performance, cash flow, and total shareholder returns. We\u2019re very pleased to report record quarterly performance together with a record strong finish to 2019 that started off paused and sluggish and ended the year with a rather robust housing market.","Our results reflect both the continued strength in the housing market, as well as our continued focus on leveraging size and scale to drive greater cash flow and higher returns on equity and on capital.","On the macro front, the housing market continued to strengthen throughout the fourth quarter, confirming the continuing trends that we reported in our last two quarterly earnings calls. The market for new homes has continued a steady improvement from last year\u2019s pause, as lower interest rates have stimulated demand, while the overall fundamentals of the economy have remained strong.","We clearly saw traffic and sales continue to strengthen in the fourth quarter, as a combination of lower interest rates and slower price appreciation have positively impacted affordability. Greater affordability, together with low unemployment, wage growth, consumer confidence, and economic growth drove home purchases, especially at the entry-level to return to a more affordable housing market.","Even with the constant noise from the current election cycle and from the ebb and flow of global tensions, which we\u2019re seeing play out in real-time, the indicators that we see and hear from our customers reflect confidence in the stability of the economy and in the job market. As of now and through today, the housing market is strong.","On the company front, Lennar achieved record results as we posted net earnings of over $674 million, or $2.13 a share for the quarter, and approximately $1.850 billion or $5.74 per share for the year. These results derived primarily from solid operating results from both homebuilding and Financial Services, as our ancillary businesses have become less of a factor.","In homebuilding, improvement in new orders and deliveries produced a gross margin of 21.5% for the quarter, which was at the high-end of our guidance last quarter. While deliveries jumped 16% over last year and new orders improved 23% over last year\u2019s rather tepid fourth quarter, our size and scale in most of the best markets in the country enables us to offset rising land costs with production cost savings, while overhead leverage has driven our SG&A to an all-time fourth quarter low of 7.6% and a full-year low of 8.3%, which has enabled the net margin of 13.9% and 12.3%, respectively. We\u2019re confident that these trends are going to continue into 2020.","Our Financial Services performance also continued to contribute to our earnings beat. I want to focus on this segment for a minute as I did last quarter. Our Financial Services performance and improvement continues to be a proxy for many of the important initiatives driving our company into next year and beyond.","For the year, Financial \u2013 our Financial Services division earned $244 million versus $200 million last year, up 22%. Performance improved though through the year and in the current quarter. Our Financial Services segment generated a record quarterly profit of $81.2 million compared to $57.6 million last year or a 41% improvement.","This record profit comes after selling substantially all of the company\u2019s retail operations in both mortgage and title in the first quarter earlier this year. These sales enabled our team to focus on the core homebuying business and to implement technology initiatives that are streamlining the remaining business. This focus on the core business drove significant operational improvement in the second half of the year.","First, we increased the company\u2019s combined mortgage capture rate from 78% \u2013 to 78% from 74% by focusing on simplifying our customers engagement and providing excellent customer service.","Second, we reduced the cost to originate a loan by 11% from $6,300 per loan last year to $6,000 per loan in the third quarter to $5,600 per loan this quarter, steady improvement, and this is down by one-third from $8,400 per loan in 2017.","These cost reductions were driven by management\u2019s focused on technology initiatives, which include our blend front-end technology for loan application, along with robotic processes that automate repetitive processes to reduce paper flow and streamline the closing process. These improvements all lead to not only lower cost to the company, but to a friendlier and frictionless customer experience with the company.","Finally, we have reduced total Financial Services headcount by about 50% at the same time. Technology, together with management focus, has enabled efficiency, a better customer experience, and a much better bottom line.","In our Financial Services division, our management team and the entire group have made technology initiatives a core mission and are showing leadership for the entire company in that regard. Accordingly, we\u2019re gaining ever more confidence that we will continue to improve our entire end-to-end process to get to a one tap closing and create a customer satisfaction process that is simple, frictionless, and has never been seen before.","And as we\u2019re building these improvements, we\u2019re also seeing the fruits of our focus in investments at the bottom line. These improvements specifically, and these types of improvements generally are sustainable, and they will continue to drive bottom line improvement in our Financial Services segment and across our entire company in the future.","Over the next two years, we expect to see some of the same technology-based improvements affecting our core homebuilding operations, specifically in areas of customer acquisition costs and even flow production and inventory management. Stay tuned.","Moving on, while our strong operating results drove the bottom line, we are simultaneously focused on any and all ways to improve total shareholder returns by reducing our asset base. Our fourth quarter results reflect our overall focus on land spend and inventory control that has enhanced our strong and improving cash flow picture as well.","We\u2019ve maintained a relentless focus on our pivot to a land lighter strategy. From the timing of land purchases to the duration of each land asset that we buy to the percentage of option versus owned land, we are and will continue migrating towards a significantly smaller land-owned inventory, driving our business and our cash flow forward.","While we\u2019re also driving our asset base lower by continuing to focus on monetizing non-core assets and business segments, our most immediately impactful focus remains on our land spend and our inventory.","With that said, strong operating results and our focus on asset base has increased cash flow for this year to $1.6 billion and projected annual cash flow expectations for 2020 are continuing to head towards the $2 billion mark.","In the fourth quarter, we used excess cash to repay an additional $600 million of debt, while we also repurchased another 1.7 million shares of stock at an average price of just under $59 a share.","For the year, we retired $1.1 billion of senior debt, while repurchasing almost 10 million shares of stock, while we ended the year with $1.2 billion of cash and our revolver paid to zero. We improved our balance sheet with a debt to total cap ratio of approximately 33%, which is a 410 basis point improvement over last year.","As we look to 2020, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and will use cash to pay down debt and to return capital to shareholders, while improving our balance sheet as we continue to improve our total shareholder returns.","In conclusion, let me end where I began. We had another excellent quarter and year-end. Our management team is laser-focused on driving returns with excellent operational execution and careful land and inventory management. This focus is not just demonstrated by our words, but also by last year\u2019s results.","While 2019 is in the book, 2020 seems even brighter to us. We remain encouraged by both market conditions for the remainder of the year and Lennar\u2019s position in it. Our size and scale continues to facilitate the management of cost and the production in a land and labor constraints market.","In addition to carrying forward the successes of last year, we have the additional opportunities of our growing single-family for rent initiative and our technology-based improvements to the way our customers purchase a home and the way our customers live in a home. These strategies, along with our \u201csustainable Lennar sub team\u201d will continue to drive operational innovation and excellence and enhance total shareholder return.","With that, let me turn it over to the rest of the team. Rick?","Rick Beckwitt","Thanks, Stuart. We had a strong quarter in each of our business segments, driven by a solid execution of our operating strategies. Homebuilding revenues for the fourth quarter totaled $6.5 billion, representing an 8% increase from 2018. This was driven by a 16% increase in deliveries to 16,420 homes, partially offset by a 7% decrease in average sales price.","Deliveries for the quarter exceeded the high-end of our guidance, as we carefully matched available inventory with strong buyer demand. The decline in average sales price was driven by our continued strategic focus on the very robust entry-level market, as our percentage of first-time buyers increased year-over-year.","Our gross margin for the quarter totaled 21.5%, which was the top side of our guidance, and up 110 basis points sequentially from the third quarter. This sequential improvement benefited from the direct cost savings that Jon will discuss, as well as a higher number of deliveries, which allowed us to leverage our field expense.","Our SG&A in the quarter was 7.6%. This marks an all-time fourth quarter low and highlights the power of our increased market scale and operating leverage. Homebuilding operating earnings totaled $893 million, up 11% from the prior year. We\u2019re proud of the fact that our homebuilding earnings are growing at a faster rate than revenues once again, demonstrating our operating leverage.","Net earnings for the quarter totaled $674 million, up 11% from 2018, excluding the gain on the sale of Rialto and non-recurring expenses in the prior year. New orders for the quarter increased 23% to 13,089 homes, exceeding the high-end of our guidance.","From a dollar value perspective, new orders totaled $5.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which was up 23% from the prior year as well. New orders increased significantly in each of our operating in our Homebuilding segments, with extremely strong performance from our Texas region and our West region, where new orders were up 48% and 34%, respectively, year-over-year. Our Texas segment is perfectly positioned and continues to benefit from our strategic focus on the strong entry-level market.","During the fourth quarter, we saw increased demand, which benefited from favorable housing market fundamentals, low unemployment, higher wages, competitive mortgage rates, low inventory levels, and a much more confident homebuyer, all contributed to a 26% increase in our sales pace per community year-over-year.","We ended the fourth quarter with a sales backlog of 15,577 homes, with a dollar value of $6.3 billion. This backlog, combined with our current housing inventory, puts us in a great position to close between 54,000 and 55,000 homes in fiscal 2020.","As Stuart said, in fiscal 2019, we were laser-focused on improving our returns on capital and generating increased cash flow. With this in mind, increasing our percentage of option homesites and reducing our year supply of owned homesites were top priorities.","At the beginning of the year, we set a two-year goal of having 40% of our homesites controlled via options and similar arrangements. We made great progress on this front throughout the year, as we ended the first quarter with a 24% mix, ended the third quarter at 30% and finished the year at 33%. Based on our progress, our new two-year goal is to have 50% of our land needs controlled versus owned by the end of fiscal 2021.","During the fourth quarter, we also made to get significant progress on reducing our years owned supply of homesites from 4.4 years at the end of the third quarter to 4.1 years at the end of the fourth quarter. Based on this progress, we believe we can reduce our years owned supply of homesites to three years by the end of fiscal 2021 as well. If we\u2019re successful, this would reduce our on-balance sheet land position by approximately $3 billion.","The combined impact of properly executing on our land lighter business and reaching our stated owned and controlled goals will drive meaningful higher cash flow, returns on capital and total shareholder returns.","Consistent with our land light strategy and focused on increased returns, we\u2019re continuing to develop a program to develop and address the single-family rental market. There\u2019s no question that there\u2019s a shortage of affordable and workforce housing, and new single-family rentals can solve this problem.","Given the shortage, there\u2019s intense investor interest in professionally managed new single-family rental communities, where the owner can leverage the overhead costs of managing the rentals, because they are in the same community with identical features from home-to-home.","Last quarter, we dilated our single-family rental program, where our homebuilding operation will be building and selling homes in bulk in communities with land is owned by third parties, with no lease-up risk to Lennar. Since then, we\u2019ve expanded this program to include building and selling incremental single-family rentals in bulk in separate sections of some of our larger existing communities.","While we\u2019re at the beginning stages of growing this business, we\u2019re excited about its growth prospects. Given the lead time in developing new communities and getting home production started, single-family rentals will only represent about a 1% of our closings in 2020. However, this program will have a much more meaningful impact in 2021, and we will provide an update accordingly.","Single-family rental is an expansion of our core business, as it allows us to leverage our existing machine and overhead. Additionally, this program provides an interesting and unique hedge to our for-sale business.","Before I turn it over to Jon, I would like to thank our associates and our trade partners for an excellent year. Through your hard work and collaboration, we accomplished many great things in 2019. And more importantly, we\u2019re excellently positioned to execute on our strategy since 2020.","I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jon now.","Jon Jaffe","Thanks, Rick. As we look back on the quarter in our fiscal year, we can clearly see the benefits we are receiving from our significant size and scale across the platform. For both the fourth quarter and for the year, we delivered the most homes in Lennar\u2019s history.","We continue to see the benefits in our direct construction costs and in our SG&A that are not only result of this size and scale, but also of our focus on process, particularly the simplification of processes to maximize efficiencies.","Turning first to direct construction costs. I noted last quarter, we had visibility that our direct costs are going down sequentially, and will contribute positively to our gross margins going forward.","In our fourth quarter, 70 basis points of our 110 basis points of sequential margin improvement came from our direct construction costs. In the fourth quarter, our direct cost as a percentage of our average sales price was 45.5%. Throughout 2019, this cost to price ratio has trended downward each quarter. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2020, even though we\u2019re projecting lower sales prices in 2020 due to a higher mix of entry-level homes.","Looking at cost per square foot, year-over-year, our direct costs were up less than 1%, while our average square footage was down by 4%. This is an improvement from the third quarter\u2019s 3% year-over-year increase and marks the lowest rate of year-over-year direct costs increase in 12 quarters.","Going forward, as we deliver more entry-level homes and our average selling price and square footage will both continue to be lower. While this is occurring, the ability to both lower our direct construction costs as a percentage of average sales price and to keep our cost per square foot relatively flat, demonstrate the value of the size, scale and efficiency of our platform.","Across the country, our builder of choice focus allows Lennar to minimize the impacts of the labor shortage, while maximizing supply chain efficiencies. Throughout 2019, we were disciplined with our even flow production model, which combined with our everything is included platform gives predictability to our trade partners, suppliers and manufacturers.","Turning now to overhead. As noted, our fourth quarter and full-year SG&A of 7.6% and 8.3%, respectively, were both all-time company lows. Our focus on simplicity and technology, combined with our size and scale, continue to give us SG&A leverage.","As we improve our systems and simplify our processes, our associates increasingly become more efficient. In the fourth quarter, our year-over-year personnel spend in homebuilding SG&A was down 1%, while our volume increased by 16%, giving us significant G&A leverage.","We achieved sales and marketing leverage through the use of technology to reduce our sales and marketing spend. As we mentioned last quarter, we are focused on higher-quality Internet leads to our Internet sales team. In the fourth quarter, we had over 90,000 Internet leads, meaning, we had that many customers requesting specific information about a home or community.","Our team of Internet sales consultants then communicate with the customer online via text messaging or by phone call to learn more about the customers\u2019 needs and then match their specific needs with our homes and the range and visit to one of our communities. The result is high-quality, very well informed customers, with set times visiting our communities.","In summary, we\u2019re executing our game plan with the following unified playbooks: one, simplification, maximizing the efficiency of every process; two, asset light, optioning land and buying land with shorter durations; three, even flow production, operating our everything is included platform with a step production start pace, while matching sales to this page using our dynamic pricing model; four, lower direct construction costs, developing strategic builder of choice partnerships throughout the supply chain, along with value engineering workshops division by division; and five, technology, providing better systems and information for happier more productive associates, a better customer experience and lower costs.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Diane.","Diane Bessette","Thank you, Jon, and good morning to everyone. So please let me start with reemphasizing a few points from our fourth quarter starting with homebuilding. So as Rick mentioned, deliveries increased 16% from the prior year and exceeded the upper range of our guidance by 3%, as we benefited from a strong housing market and a continued focus on returns.","Our fourth quarter gross margin was 21.5%, which was at the higher-end of our guidance and the prior year\u2019s gross margin was 22.1% excluding CalAtlantic purchase accounting.","Our fourth quarter SG&A was 7.6%, which is the lowest quarter SG&A percent we have ever achieved and was below our guidance. This compared to 7.9% in the prior year. New orders increased 23% from the prior year and exceeded the upper range of our guidance by 6%.","Absorption for the fourth quarter was a 3.4 versus 2.7 in the price year, as we benefited from increased demand and focused on accelerating the closeout of slower-paced communities to enhance returns. Our ending community count was 1,283. And finally, for homebuilding joint ventures, land sales and other categories, we had a combined loss of $2 million, compared to $4 million of earnings in the prior year.","And then turning to Financial Services. As Stuart mentioned, operating earnings were $81 million, compared to $58 million in the prior year, and here\u2019s the detail of the components. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $57 million from $44 million in the prior year. Mortgage earnings improved due to an increase in capital volume as a result of higher homebuilding deliveries and a higher capture rate and reduction in loan origination costs, primarily driven by technology initiatives, which enabled us to reduce headcount, as Stuart mentioned.","Title operating earnings were $22 million, net of non-controlling interest, compared to $18 million in the prior year. The increase was due to an increase in capital volume and our focus on cost reductions to right-size the business.","Rialto Mortgage Finance operating earnings were $3 million, compared to a loss of $1 million in the prior year. This was driven by an increase in securitization dollar volume, partially offset by a decrease in securitization margins.","And then turning to multifamily. Our Multifamily segment had operating earnings of $5 million net of non-controlling interest, compared to $33 million in the prior year. There were no building sales this quarter, as compared to three transactions in the prior year.","And finally, Other. This is the category of the legacy Rialto assets outside of Rialto Mortgage Finance and our strategic technology investments. Earnings were $11 million this quarter, compared to losses of $49 million in the prior year. This quarter, earnings were largely driven by earnings related to our Rialto fund investments, while prior year losses were primarily due to non-recurring expenses.","And then turning to our balance sheet. We ended the year with an extremely well-positioned balance sheet. In fiscal 2019, we generated approximately $1.6 billion of homebuilding cash flow and ended the year with $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We continue to make progress with our strategy to reduce years of land owned and increased our land control position.","At the end of the year, our homesites owned and controlled totaled 313,000, of which 209,000 were owned and 104,000 were controlled. As Rick mentioned, our years of land supply owned decreased to 4.1 at the end of Q4 from 4.4 at the end of Q3. Our controlled homesites increased to 33% at the end of Q4 from 30% at the end of Q3. At the end of the year, we had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility, thereby providing $2.5 billion of available capacity.","During the quarter, we retired $600 million senior notes that were due in November. This brings our senior note repayments to $1.1 billion for the year and $2.2 billion since the acquisition of CalAtlantic.","During the quarter, we repurchase 1.7 million shares for a total of approximately $98 million. This brings our total for the year to 9.8 million shares, totaling $493 million. At the end of the year, our debt to total cap was 32.8, a 410 basis point improvement from the end of 2018.","So now turning to guidance. I\u2019d like to provide some high-level guidance for fiscal 2020 and then I will provide more detailed guidance for the first quarter. So for the full-year of 2020, we expect to deliver between 54,000 and 55,000 homes, with an average sales price for the year of approximately 385,000. This average sales price reflects our focus on a higher percentage of entry-level product.","Our fiscal 2020 gross margin is expected to remain consistent with fiscal 2019 and it will be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Although entry-level margins tend to be slightly lower, we believe our margins for the year will benefit from our continued focus on reducing construction spend, leveraging field expenses over more deliveries and reduced interest expense as we\u2019ve continued to pay down our senior note maturities.","Our fiscal 2020 SG&A should be in the range of 8.2% to 8.3%. And as we continue to add higher volume, higher absorption entry-level communities, while also accelerating the closeout of slower paced communities to enhance returns, we expect our community count to grow 1% to 2% by the end of the year.","Financial Services earnings should be in the range of $250 million to $255 million, and we expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.25%, primarily due to the recent extension by Congress of energy-efficient home credits.","Now, let me give you more detailed guidance for Q1 only, starting with homebuilding. We expect Q1 new orders to be in the range of 11,300 to 11,500, and our Q1 deliveries to be in the range of 9,800 to 10,000 homes. Our Q1 average sales price should be between 390,000 and 395,000.","We expect our Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 19.7% to 19.8%, noting that this will be our lowest margin quarter for the year, and margins will increase throughout the year to be in the range previously stated. We expect our Q1 SG&A to be in the range of 9.4% and 9.5%. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect a Q1 loss of approximately $10 million.","We believe our Financial Services earnings for Q1 will be in the range of $25 to $27 million. Our multifamily operations will be at about break-even. And for the other category related to the legacy Rialto assets and our strategic investments, we expect Q1 earnings of approximately $8 million to $10 million. We expect our Q1 corporate G&A to be about 2% of total revenues. And as previously stated, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.25%.","The weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 313 million shares. And so when you roll all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $0.80 to $0.85 for the quarter.","So in summary, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to have strong profitability and increase in cash flow generation in 2020.","And now, let me turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Truman Patterson","Hi, good morning, everybody, and nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I just wanted to start off kind of a multi-part question on entry-level, multiple industry participants are moving to the entry-level. Do you all see an upcoming supply imbalance or are you seeing robust enough demand that\u2019s really allowing the entry-level communities to generate greater than historical absorption paces?","And on the prior call, you all suggested that, maybe you could get the 44% entry-level in 2020. Do you think there\u2019s possibly upside to that level given the demand that you\u2019ve been seeing?","And finally, could you just give an update on kind of the gross margin profile versus your other segments, how much of a drag it might be on your margin profile?","Stuart Miller","Truman, let me start just at a macro level and say, it\u2019s important for everyone to remember that the entry-level part of the market has remained impaired for the longest period of time since the downturn and really had a very difficult time getting started. So that part of the market is probably the most supply constrained. When you note that a number of participants are migrating towards that market, it has most recent \u2013 more recently become accessible. Demand is very strong in that part of the market. And I think it\u2019s going to be sometime before it gets saturated.","Rick, Jon, maybe you\u2019d like to talk about margin and\u2026","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. So from a \u2013 from an overall mix standpoint and our position, I think, we really have benefited from the fact that this has been something that we strategically target for the last several years. We\u2019ve been very methodical on lining up communities, repositioning products, working with our developer partners to really secure excellent positions that are sizable.","When you\u2019re dealing with a single-family or an entry-level product, you need some larger communities, because your absorption pace in these communities is much faster. So, we\u2019re really well-positioned. From a mix standpoint, do we get up to 44%? I think, it\u2019s too soon to tell. We\u2019re probably in the low-40% right now, and we\u2019re just going to see how the years evolve.","From a margin standpoint, as Diane said, the margins tend to be slightly lower than our first-time move-up and move-up product, but they come with higher velocity. And as a result, the IRRs associated with the build out of those communities is much, much higher, and that\u2019s why we focused on that. Jon, anything else?","Jon Jaffe","You covered it.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Okay, thanks for that. Your rotation towards option lots, it\u2019s \u2013 your traction has been a little bit faster than what we\u2019ve expected in the past couple of quarters. Could you just discuss the health of the option land market, whether these lots are becoming more available across the industry or whether this is purely the result of your land developer partners?","And kind of part two of that question, could you just give an update on the strategy to expand your developer partner relationships? I believe you were at three previously, what you\u2019re kind of thinking throughout 2020?","Rick Beckwitt","So, I think, what this really reflects is, as a management team, when we \u2013 when Stuart, Jon, and I sit down and we make a plan, we execute on the plan. And we really decided that we were going to convert and increase the amount of our option position. We worked with our regional trade partners and our regional developers and have significantly expanded that program.","We haven\u2019t necessarily entered into new arrangements with different developers. Rather, what we\u2019ve done is expand the footprint of those relationships to other markets and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in the increase. In addition to that, our teams out there are really leveraging the relationships they have in all of their markets to increase that percentage.","Truman Patterson","Okay, thanks, guys.","Stuart Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.","Alan Ratner","Hey, guys, good morning. Congrats on the very strong performance. So I was hoping to drill in a little bit just in terms of your thinking right now on the capital allocation. You mentioned, the focus on return several times. And this year was a huge year for cash flow as you were expecting, so great to see that it come to fruition. If I look at how you spend your cash this year, debt on the balance sheet came down by about $800 million, buybacks were about $500 million.","I know a lot of builders say the first and main use of cash is for growing the business, but it certainly seems like you\u2019re in a pretty enviable position where you can do that and throw off a lot of cash flow. So should we think about the, generally, the use of cash this year towards debt reduction and buyback is kind of how you\u2019re thinking about prioritizing that or has that shifted at all given the fact that your debt to capital is now down to that 30% type level?","Stuart Miller","So, as we noted in our comments, we expect to continue to pay down debt certainly, as it comes due. I think we noted that over the next year, over 2020, we have about $600 million of longer-term debt coming due. You can expect that we\u2019ll pay that down out of cash flow.","But additionally, returns to shareholders focus on returning of capital to shareholders is something that will be continued and properly balanced. As we\u2019ve looked at our business and looked at our growth expectations, normal operations today are cash flow positive. As we noted, last year we produced $1.6 billion, and we expect to continue that trend and more. And that excess capital is going to be balanced exactly as noted. We\u2019re very focused on our balance sheet, very focused on total shareholder return.","Alan Ratner","Thank you for that, Stuart. And second question, if I could on the SFR, the expansion there. First off, I guess, just more housekeeping. Were there any orders this quarter that, that flowed through the order line that works geared towards SFR? And I guess, more high-level, as you start to build these homes and existing communities, can you talk a little bit about the product that you\u2019re building for rental? Is it comparable to your for sale product? And if so, is there any concern about cannibalizing that piece of the business, or is it being priced differently that, that it shouldn\u2019t compete?","Stuart Miller","So let me just start off by saying is that, right now, this business is very small in the grand scheme of things. And what we\u2019ve really done is focused on positioning to grow something that\u2019s substantive.","So from an order perspective for the last quarter, the orders associated with this were de minimis. What we\u2019ve really been focusing on is identifying markets that we can build a good business that is focused on providing products that the market needs.","Within our existing communities, what we\u2019ve really done is looked at sectioning off different phases or sections of the community that will be priced completely differently than our other sale for product. So smaller footprint, lower specification levels, not a lot of change from home-to-home pretty identical features right down the street.","Alan Ratner","Got it.","Rick Beckwitt","But let me back up for a second and say this. SFR has been a part of the sales program for the past two years, both in our company and others. It\u2019s basically been on a one-off basis. It\u2019s more mom-and-pop-oriented. What we have been innovating over the past years and we dilated this in Reno. It\u2019s a continuation of that. It\u2019s a more structured program and we\u2019ve been focusing on looking at single-family plan for rent communities, which is where we have innovated and our kind of branding going forward a new way of thinking about single-family for rent.","We are at the early stages of this. It has been an evolutionary track for the company. You\u2019re going to see others follow suit. Capital is starting to understand this business, and this will be an emergent story as we go forward. But the single-family for rent that we\u2019re talking about is single-family communities for rent, which will be \u2013 there\u2019ll be a circle around that community.","While there will be similarities with other single-family product, it won\u2019t be directly competitive, but instead, this product is going to enable a consumer that wants single-family, but might not quite be able to get into a for sale program, very enthusiastic about this and it\u2019s a uniquely Lennar branded program.","Jon Jaffe","I just had two points. One is, we don\u2019t think it will cannibalize our existing product at all. It\u2019s the same product. It\u2019s really filling the need, as Stuart just mentioned, of a consumer that can afford to buy and doesn\u2019t make sense for them to buy. The other point is, the focus on this for us will further enhance our builder of choice position with the trade as we have more volume and this is even more consistent and higher volume. So we see that as being very complimentary to our construction platform.","Alan Ratner","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.","Stuart Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. My first question I had is focusing just on some of your comments around inventory and driving returns and the resulting cash flow. I don\u2019t know if I heard and maybe totally don\u2019t give, but I was just trying to get a sense when you talked about having inventory, your balance of inventory down $3 billion over the next two years, I was wondering if you could give us what that number is, or at the end of this year, just to get a sense of where that number could go?","And with that amount of inventory balance reduction, should we be expecting potentially an acceleration of share repurchase with the use of that, as that cash frees up? I mean, obviously, you have a $1.2 billion of debt due next year. But given you\u2019re still declining debt to cap, I would assume, you\u2019d want some debt on the balance sheet and you can kind of push that maturity out. So just trying to get a sense again of the finer numbers around that, that inventory reduction and how we should think about the use of that cash?","Stuart Miller","Well, let me start off by just generally telling you how we look at the dollar value difference. Yes, we\u2019ve told you that what we want to do is take our own supply from 4.1 years to three years by 2021. And if you step back and you look at it, you can calculate that two different ways. We \u2013 which \u2013 it\u2019s about one year of land purchase, so we buy about $3 billion of land a year. So $3 billion sort of sums up to that number.","Looking at it in a different way, based on our guidance of 50 \u2013 54,000 to 55,000 homes for next year. If we don\u2019t have to buy the homesites associated with that, our average lot finished homesite or underdeveloped, in some cases, finished our homesite is about 54,000, 55,000, which gets you to the same $3 billion number.","Rick Beckwitt","And so, look, it\u2019s a pretty straight math calculation to look at the $3 billion number. Mike, you\u2019re correct in highlighting that this is additive to cash flow, as we migrate in this direction. We do expect that cash flow will continue to benefit from our inventory and land strategy. And I think that your question is, does that mean that we accelerate things like debt and shareholder \u2013 a return of capital to shareholders? And the answer to that is decidedly, yes.","Michael Rehaut","Great, thank you. I guess, second question just a little bit finer tuning granularity around order growth and how to think about that for the upcoming year? Obviously, you gave first quarter guidance and as well as community count growth expected to be 1% or \u2013 1% to 2%, I believe, for the year as soon as a year-end over year-end if you could clarify that?","But how should we think about the sales pace component of that, given that you\u2019ve kind of mentioned that you continue to expect to shift a little bit more towards entry-level, which is higher, sales pace versus other segments, other buyer segments, as well as the fact that, you\u2019d expect the broader market to continue to improve a little bit, given where we are with rates and affordability, et cetera?","So, just trying to kind of break out the pieces of that, I think expectations perhaps are in a low to mid single-digit type of range for sales pace growth. But any thoughts around how you\u2019re thinking about that for the first quarter and the full year would be very helpful?","Jon Jaffe","Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Jon. First of all, that is correct. It\u2019s your year-end to year-end comparison. As we think about pace, it really goes back to my commentary about a very disciplined production approach and matching sales pace to that. So to the extent that the market is stronger or not, we\u2019ll adjust pricing accordingly.","So we expect our pace to be a consistent one. And to the extent, the market is stronger, we would hope that we\u2019ll see improvement in margins over what we\u2019re projecting. To the extent that the market were to soften, we expect the pace to be consistent and we would do some reflection of that in our margins.","Rick Beckwitt","I\u2019d say additionally, that, as part of our land and inventory management program, looking internally, we have clearly focused on more of our higher-paced communities and focusing on those communities with greater absorption. And we\u2019ve clearly and decidedly been pruning some of the slower-pace communities that might have come from CalAtlantic legacy that, that are more of a drag on some of our returns. So this is all part of our inventory management program. And we\u2019ve been looking community by community to enhance that the absorption rate, therefore, enhancing returns.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. So just to be clear, then, given that shift that you\u2019re describing Stuart, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to expect an order growth rate for the year that would exceed the community count growth that you\u2019re looking for?","Stuart Miller","Well, I think that definitely. I mean, if you just look at the guidance we gave with regard to deliveries, the delivery growth is higher than the increase in communities. So you\u2019ll get a natural increase in overall sales that are greater than the 1% to 2% growth in community count.","Rick Beckwitt","And that\u2019s a more efficient, more effective business model.","Stuart Miller","That\u2019s right. We\u2019ve strategically focused on getting higher velocity out of each community, as opposed to growing communities at a higher rate.","Michael Rehaut","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Your line is open.","Carl Reichardt","Thanks. Happy New Year, everybody.","Stuart Miller","Good morning, Carl.","Carl Reichardt","Jon, I wanted to ask a little bit about subcontractor trade costs, obviously, starts for a flat this year, we build a reporting some really significant order growth and move to the entry-level, which increases number of units started sort of it for two reasons: one, the velocity and also just business is better. How are you thinking about the trades? You didn\u2019t seem like they had a lot of overcapacity or not enough work last year?","Are they going to look even with your scale and trying to get more aggressive on their pricing to you? And how do you combat that? Is it just scale? Is it just product simplicity and a focus on everything\u2019s included and even flow? I\u2019m just curious what your perspective is, maybe not just this year, but also maybe for a year or two?","Jon Jaffe","Sure. Well, as you look backward, and as you look forward, there is a severe shortage of labor in the industry, particularly skilled labor. And we really don\u2019t see that improving, because a lot of the labor out there is actually aging out from the workforce. So we expect that pressure to continue.","And as we started several years ago, we really thought about the fact that as volume grows, there\u2019ll be more pressure on the system. And that\u2019s why we really reinvented ourselves with its focus of being the builder of choice.","So it\u2019s much more than just volume and scale that has a big part, that\u2019s strategically positioned us to be most desirable, but it has everything to do with this even flow production and predictability that gives trades or everything is included platform is really critical, because one of the big obstacles for trade is that they go out to a job site and it\u2019s not ready for them. That inefficient use of labor that\u2019s already in short supply, backed up on itself and creates real issues.","And because of that, the trades find us more favorable to work for to get the jobs run smoother than more predictable. They don\u2019t have the starts and stops of options and upgrades. And so we are continuing to focus on how do we get even better at that, at least, even more disciplined about even flow. So that, as we move forward, the trades you\u2019re actually able to make more money on our business, because it\u2019s efficient, not because we\u2019re paying them more.","Carl Reichardt","That makes sense. And then Stuart or Rick, just on pricing, again, the mix to the entry-level more price sensitive customer. We\u2019ve seen builders in the past, use price to control pace, so that production can actually catch up. But you\u2019re running even flow and your mix is changing. How do you look at your pricing power as you head into this year with such robust demand? But what\u2019s likely to be a more price sensitive consumer? And obviously, using dynamic pricing, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s helping manage pace? But again, is this different than what we\u2019ve seen in the past, where builders were shoving price to try to hold the pace off?","Stuart Miller","Yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s different. It\u2019s \u2013 for us, it\u2019s going to be, as we\u2019ve said, to be on a very consistent pace. And if the market is strong, right, they\u2019re currently is showing signs of now, as Stuart said, it\u2019s strong. And we see that across our markets that we will have pricing power greater than we had in the last year or two. That will unfold, as the months go by, and we\u2019ll see exactly what the market is like. But as we look at it right now, it is strong. And we would expect to be able to benefit from that.","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. And I think the thing to focus on, we will solve to price, whether that\u2019s a higher price or lower price, but we\u2019re very focused on net operating margin for each community.","Carl Reichardt","Thanks, Rick. Thanks, all.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Yes. Thanks very much, guys. Good quarter. Thanks for the information regarding your outlook for the year and the quarter. I had a little question about the interplay of the margins and the order cadence you suggested in 1Q. And I guess, in general, my question is your margin assumption for the quarter versus the year, since you said that you expected the first quarter to be the low in the year and you gave a pretty healthy guide for the full-year? Can you give us a sense for when in the year you\u2019re expecting to see that, that fairly meaningful step up in the margin?","Is that going to be like how to 2Q, 3Q events? Or is that something that you\u2019re sort of envisioning will happen later in the year? And if it is, like as soon as the second quarter, is that a reflection of the current environment allowing you to get better price than the order comment you made up about 8% would suggest?","Jon Jaffe","Hey, Steve, it\u2019s Jon. As an overview, remember, that our first quarter is always our lowest from a volume perspective, and therefore, our field has spread out. It has a bigger impact on the margins in the first quarter. And you always see that trend with us. So what we don\u2019t see it sequentially throughout the year, our margins will improve as we get greater field leverage, just purely based on volume.","The improvement is throughout the year, though, based on what we expect to see with this more efficient, both gross margin and operating margin out of the efficiencies, we\u2019re gaining in our systems and our costs and our SG&A that should flow through all of our numbers. So it\u2019s really the combination of those two things progressing throughout the year.","Diane Bessette","Yes, Stephen, maybe the only thing I\u2019d add is, I think, if you look at the growth of gross margin in 2019 that would give you a really good proxy for what we\u2019re expecting in 2020 with the back-half of the year having the highest increase in margin.","Stephen Kim","Got it. All right, that\u2019s helpful. Secondly, I was really intrigued by this comment, Stuart, you made about how you saw the improvement in the Financial Services business and I guess, specifically, you cited the mortgage origination business and some of the tech initiatives that you\u2019ve got going on there. As I believe, you used the word proxy for what we might see from many of your other tech initiatives across the company.","And I was curious if you could give us a little bit of a preview as to what you meant by that. I think you had said, homebuilding customer acquisition costs and even flow in construction management, as I think about some of the initiatives you\u2019ve got, obviously, you have the eye buyer investments in open door, which could lead to customer acquisition costs. Could \u2013 but I\u2019m particularly intrigued by this even flow in construction management. How \u2013 in what way could be improvement we saw in your mortgage origination business be a proxy for that?","Stuart Miller","So thank you for listening to the call carefully, Steve. Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I said. And it starts with the fact that, that in our Financial Services group, which is where we really initiated many of our technology initiatives, we had a management team start to dip the toe than a foot than a leg into the technology stream. And as they became more entrenched, there was kind of a feedback loop that began. That said, wow, this really does have import. This really can have impact. And the more we did, the more we explored, the more we found, we could change the way that our business operates.","If you think about the migration from, I think, it was $8,600, $8,700 per loan in 2017 towards a 6,000 or 5,600 per loan cost of origination. That\u2019s a sizable step over a fairly short period of time. And it comes from management focus and integration of new technologies new ways of doing business that hadn\u2019t been done or tried before. And the feedback that comes from early successes, feeding the adventure of drilling deeper and trying more.","We\u2019re starting to see many of those things happen in and around our dynamic pricing program. We\u2019ve talked about it before. Early adoption starts to breed some early successes, it takes sometime for those earlier successes to start accelerate, start to accelerate and start to translate into real cost reductions. But we\u2019re starting to see real efficiency in the way that our inventory turns.","If we look back from this year\u2019s at year-end back to last year\u2019s year-end, the efficiency with which we\u2019re driving closings through the year is having real bottom line impact in the way that our business has configured and we think that, that will accelerate.","As it relates to customer acquisition, we\u2019ve talked about a number of our initiatives, open door being one of them, but other \u2013 others of them are more internally focused about customer acquisition, and then lead scoring, developing into a driven-focused Internet sales consultant approach to the way that we handle our customers. We think that, that as it starts to drive as we start to drive adoption, we\u2019ll drive costs down inefficiencies up.","So there are a lot of initiatives going on behind the scenes. If you would ask me this question at the beginning of the innovation cycle in Financial Services, it would have been hard to demonstrate the specific areas, where costs would come from, but its management focus, early successes and adoption and that cycle that drives the cost structure down. And I think that the Financial Services group in that regard is a proxy for the way that we\u2019re seeing things starting to happen on the homebuilding side as well. Does that help?","Stephen Kim","Yes. No, that\u2019s very interesting. I guess, just the one little clarification on my part would be the numbers you gave around the mortgage cap, mortgage origination costs declining. I assume you\u2019re implying from that, that your improvement that you traced out for us has been better than what you believe the industry overall has been. So that\u2019s not just an industry issue, that\u2019s a Lennar issue. And similarly, you expect that in these other avenues as well, is that correct?","Stuart Miller","Listen, I can\u2019t really look at what the rest of the industry is doing at a micro level. But from what we understand at a macro level, the costs within the industry have been migrating higher and we are an outlier in that regard.","Stephen Kim","Great. Thanks very much.","Stuart Miller","You\u2019re welcome. How about one more question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Charles Brown","Good morning. This is actually Charles Brown filling in for Susan. Thanks for taking my question and congratulation on strong results.","Stuart Miller","Thank you.","Charles Brown","I was just wondering if you can provide an update on some of your key markets, such as Florida, Texas and California? And also specifically for Texas, if you think your success in this region is reflective of your recent initiative in this market?","Stuart Miller","So let\u2019s start with Texas. I can tell you that we had strong performance in each one of our Texas markets, San Antonio, Austin, Dallas and Houston, all up high double digits. The region was up 48% year-over-year in orders. And it really is driven by the fact that we\u2019ve completely repositioned to a much higher percentage of entry-level product. Right now, we\u2019re about 50% of our sales and communities are below $250,000 price point, and about 70% of our communities are below 300,000. So it\u2019s the strength of that reposition that\u2019s really fueling the market there.","With regard to Florida, since Florida are very strong, particularly on the lower price points and that first time move-up, and that really is across the board. It\u2019s about the North and East West. Jon, do you want to talk about California?","Jon Jaffe","California has clearly seen a recovery, if you look at it from a year-over-year perspective, the prior year, California really fallen off and the pause affected California perhaps more than any other parts of the country. What we saw in the fourth quarter was a much healthier market, a clear recovery back to normal sales paces. Even in the Bay Area, which was perhaps the most impaired by a market slowdown in fourth quarter 2018. We\u2019ve seen that market come back to life. I wouldn\u2019t describe that as robust yet, but certainly a lot healthier.","Charles Brown","Okay. Thank you for your time, guys.","Stuart Miller","All right, very good. Well, I thank, everybody, for joining us on our call. We look forward to reporting in 2020. As you can hear, we\u2019re pretty enthusiastic about the year to come and look forward to apprised.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart Miller","Great. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter update. This morning, I am joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you have just heard from; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President, Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer are here as is Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto. And they will be available for Q&A today as well. Eric Feder isn\u2019t here today, but then instead we have Brett Ersoff who runs our RMF Rialto Mortgage Finance Group. So, he is available also.","Now, as is customary on our conference calls, I want to begin this morning with some brief overview remarks on the housing market and then briefly look at our operations. And then Bruce is going to provide greater detail. As always, we will open up to question and answers. And as in the past we would like to request that we limit ourselves to one question and one follow-up per person, so that we can leave as much time for people as possible.","So, with that let me go ahead and begin. And let me begin by saying that we are very pleased to report another very solid quarter of performance for our company. Our second quarter results demonstrate that our company is positioned to be able to continue to perform extremely well in current market conditions due to a carefully crafted operating strategy. Generally speaking, the market continues a slow and steady recovery that is driven by limited supply of available homes both new and existing that are on the market, limited supply of land available to add to the supply of these homes and constrained demand from purchasers who would like to buy, but are unable to access the mortgage market.","While many investors have been disappointed that the 2014 spring selling season did not have the steep vertical accelerations that had been anticipated, the market did continue to move slowly and steadily forward driving volume upward marginally and still driving pricing upward though at a somewhat slower pace. We continue to believe that the fundamental drivers of improvement in the housing market remain a steadily improving economy with a slowly improving employment picture unlocking pent-up demand while supplies remain constrained to meet that demand. We continue to believe that there remains a production deficit of both single and multifamily dwellings from the underproduction that took place during the economic downturn and up to and including this year and last. This shortfall is likely to continue to define the housing markets for the foreseeable future and will drive the housing recovery forward.","Lennar has begun the first half of 2014 with very solid results as each of our businesses showed strong performance and are well-positioned in the thickest part of the market for continued future performance. The combination of solid management execution of our articulated strategies and strategic investments in core assets have combined to produce strong first half results and will enable continued industry leading performance throughout the year. Homebuilding of course remains our primary driver of quarterly performance. For the second quarter homebuilding revenues grew to $1.6 billion, up 29% over last year, while deliveries were up some 12% over the prior year.","Maximizing our strong land position, we focused on balancing pricing power and sales pace while controlling costs and accordingly we produced 14.7% operating margin, 140 basis points year-over-year increase and the highest second quarter operating margin in the company\u2019s history. Our sales pace in Q2 improved to 3.7 average sales per community per month, up from Q1\u2019s pace of 2.8, but slightly lower than last year\u2019s pace of 4 per community per month. Our average sales price of $322,000 was the year-over-year increase of $40,000 or 14%, this improvement in sales pace covered increases in labor, material and land costs improving our gross margin by the 140 basis points year-over-year to 25.5%.","Our sales continue to benefit from the execution of our NextGen product strategy, year-over-year sales of our multi-generational brand grew by 58% totaling 368 sales in our second quarter. We now offered NextGen plans in 201 communities across the country and in our second quarter the average sales price for NextGen was 39% above the company\u2019s average. We have continued to focus on homebuilding strategy on the move-up segment of the market as the first time home purchaser has not yet been able to access the mortgage market. Nevertheless, we are strategically positioned with both land and product to capture the first time home buyer demand when it is enabled by the mortgage market and it emerges with inevitable strong and pent up demand.","Now complementing our homebuilding operations, our Financial Services segment continued to build its primary business along side the homebuilder and is working to replace the now diminished refi business with additional business across our national footprint. Bruce will talk a little bit more about our Financial Services progress which had a very respectable quarter with operating earnings of $18.3 million, though down from the $29.2 million last year when the refi business was thriving.","While our Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our three additional operating divisions are all continuing to mature as excellent longer term value creation platforms for the company. We continue to be very pleased with the progress of our multifamily apartment business. As we have noted in the past this business began operations in early 2011 and is positioned to become one of the leading developers of new Class A apartments in the United States. As homeownership rates have drifted downwards and as mortgage approvals have remained elusive for first time purchasers and as the large millennial generation begins to leave home and form households, this strategy continues to be an excellent complement to our primary for-sale homebuilding business.","During the second quarter, we started development and construction on two additional apartment communities. We now have 17 communities of which two are completed and operating and two are partially completed and starting a lease-up program and the remaining 13 are under construction. These communities have approximately 4,500 apartments with an estimated development cost of approximately $1 billion. In addition to these communities, we have a geographically diversified pipeline that exceeds $3 billion and represents an additional 12,000 plus apartments.","As we have discussed in the past, we are building these apartments with third-party institutional capital and each deal has been conservatively financed with non-recourse debt. With our conservative financing and our conservative underwriting, we are positioned to earn IRRs exceeding 25% and cash multiples greater than two times. And we anticipate that the construction of our development pipeline will be completed over the next four years.","Next, Rialto continues to make significant progress in transitioning from an asset-heavy balance sheet investor to a capital-light investment manager, commercial loan originator and securitizer. The initial direct investments were able to continue to return capital to Lennar in the second quarter and we believe we\u2019ll return over $400 million of cash for us to recycle by the end of 2016.","Our investment management and servicing platform is growing our assets under management and creating value for investors. We are continuing to build upon the base established with our first two real estate funds. Fund II is already \u2013 Fund I is already invested or committed. Fund I is already invested and Fund II is already invested or committed to invest almost $800 million of equity in approximately 60 transactions and has started making distributions of income to investors as well. We expect to begin raising our third real estate fund later on this year.","And finally, Rialto Mortgage Finance, our high return on equity lending platform is originating and securitizing long-term fixed rate loans on stabilized cash flow in commercial real estate properties. And we completed our seventh and eighth securitization transactions in the second quarter selling an additional $400 million of RMF originated loans bringing the total to almost $1.3 billion in only our first three quarters of securitization activity. In the second quarter, Rialto exceeded our expectations with operating results of $13.4 million this quarter, reflecting the continued maturity of a three different businesses and its positioning for strong 2014.","Our FivePoint Communities Program continues to make significant progress as well in developing our premium California master plan communities. At El Toro, the first phase of 726 homes is over 75% sold out and the second phase of the 1,000 home sites will be sold to builders around the end of this year or the beginning of next year with a grand opening expected in late spring.","At Newhall Ranch, we won two sequel lawsuits as well as an appeal of a lawsuit challenging our environmental permits this quarter. We expect any appeals to be concluded around the end of the year allowing us to begin development of the first 5,000 home sites there. And in San Francisco, we are opening the shipyard, Hunters Point, where we are pre-selling homes this quarter and will grand open models in August. Currently, about 250 homes are under construction and another 100 are scheduled to start this year. The venture will begin delivering these homes at the end of the year and the bulk of them delivering in 2015. Lastly, at Treasure Island, we are designing and processing land development engineering with an expectation to break ground in early 2016.","Overall and in summary, our company is extremely well-positioned to succeed in current market conditions. We have an excellent management team that\u2019s focused on a carefully crafted strategy that\u2019s positioned us with an advantaged asset base that will continue to drive industry-leading profitability. Additionally, we have a well-diversified platform that will continue to enhance shareholder value as our ancillary businesses continued to mature. We are very pleased with our progress and performance and we are very pleased with the progress and performance in the second quarter and look forward to reporting our progress in our third quarter soon.","With that, let me turn over to Bruce.","Bruce Gross","Thanks, Stuart and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $0.61 per diluted share. The prior year\u2019s earnings per share included a partial reversal of the state deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $0.18 per diluted share. The prior year\u2019s EPS would be $0.43 after excluding the $0.18. Revenues from home sales increased 28% in the second quarter driven by a 12% increase in deliveries and a 14% year-over-year increase in average sales price to $322,000.","In our earnings press release, we added additional disclosure by including average selling price by region. Please refer the press release tables to see this data. Our gross margin on home sales was 25.5% compared with 24.1% in the prior year. That\u2019s the 140 basis point improvement that Stuart mentioned. Sales incentive improved by 80 basis points versus the prior year to 5.9% as a percent of home sales revenue or $20,300 per home delivered in the second quarter. Additionally we had $9.6 million of insurance recoveries and other non-recurring items which added 60 basis points to the gross margin percentage for the quarter. The gross margin percentage for the quarter was highest in the East, Southeast Florida and West regions.","Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues had additional leverage and improved 10 basis points to 10.8%. And with the improvement in both gross margin and SG&A our operating margins improved again up 140 basis points to 14.7%. In addition to this significant operating margin leverage we have also recognized operating leverage in our corporate G&A line which improved 30 basis points to 2.1% as a percentage of total revenues.","Other interest expense declined from $25.1 million in the prior year to $10.3 million in the current quarter as we continued to open communities and increase the qualifying assets eligible for capitalization. This quarter we opened 95 communities and ended the quarter with 579 net active communities. We purchased 5,800 home sites during the quarter totaling $379 million. Our home sites owned and controlled now total 164,000 home sties.","Turning to Financial Services, our Financial Services business segment delivered operating earnings of $18.3 million versus $29.2 million in the prior year. This is consistent with our previous guidance that Financial Services profitability would be lower due to a more competitive environment as a result of a significant decrease in the refinance transactions. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $16.7 million from $26.1 million in the prior year. Refinance originations declined 63% from the prior year. However, we were able to replace this loss volume with additional purchase originations to end the quarter with flat year-over-year origination volume at $1.4 billion. Although the volume is flat the heightened competitive pressure has reduced the profit per loan.","Our in-house capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 77% this quarter and our title company had a $2.2 million profit in the quarter compared with the $3.7 million profit in the prior year. The reduction was primarily due to lower volume. Our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings totaling $13.4 million compared to $2.8 million in the prior year. Both amounts are a net of non-controlling interest. The composition of Rialto is $13.4 million of operating earnings by the three types of investments and these are before G&A expenses and Rialto interest expense are as follows.","First, the investment management business contributed $28.4 million of earnings. This includes $17.9 million of equity and earnings from the real estate firms and $10.5 million of management fees and other. These numbers don\u2019t include the carried interest which under a hypothetical liquidation increased by approximately $14 million for the quarter and is now at $104 million for Real Estate Fund I. Second, our new Rialto mortgage finance operations contributed $438 million of commercial loans into two securitizations resulting in strong earnings of $18.5 million for the quarter. Third, our liquidating direct investments and again these are the remaining assets in the FDIC and bank portfolios had a net loss of $1.6 million. This included our share of losses in the FDIC portfolio totaling $11.3 million which was primarily due to the share of impairments in the portfolio as a result of loan extensions and modifications extending and reducing the collections while partially offset by higher collections and gains on sales and the bank portfolios.","Rialto G&A and other expenses were $24.3 million for the quarter and interest expense was $7.5 million. Rialto\u2019s balance sheet had a strong liquidity position with $245 million of cash at quarter end. Multifamily results for the quarter are consistent with our expectations as we have net startup expenses of $7.2 million.","Turning to our balance sheet, our balance sheet liquidity is strong. We ended the quarter with $638 million of homebuilding cash balances and no outstanding borrowings under our $950 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Yesterday, we announced that we completed an amendment to our credit facility increasing our facility to $1.5 billion, which includes $263 million accordion feature. The amendment increased our borrowing capacity and provided more flexible covenants while lowering our borrowing costs. We appreciate the support from the 17 banks in our facility. This revolver increases availability and coupled with our confidence in strong earnings power going forward enables us to continue to deploy more of the cash earning low returns on our balance sheet into high return investments. Our homebuilding net debt to total capital was 48%. Stockholders\u2019 equity grew by 23% year-over-year to $4.4 billion this quarter. Our book value per share increased to $21.52 per share.","There are three adjustments I would like to highlight in our 2014 goals. Number one, deliveries, we are maintaining our goal to deliver between 21,000 and 22,000 homes for 2014. However, we are adjusting our backlog conversion ratio expectations between Q3 and Q4. We are adjusting Q3 to between 75% and 80% backlog conversion ratio due to the first quarter weather delays pushing some home completion dates into the fourth quarter. However, as a result, we are increasing our expected conversion ratio for the fourth quarter to between 95% and 100% conversion of the backlog. Second, gross margins we continue to expect our gross margins in 2014 to average 25% for the full year. And this excludes the insurance settlements highlighted in both the first and second quarter. We expect the third quarter to be in the high 24% range, while the fourth quarter should be just slightly over 25%.","Turning to Rialto, we expect a range of profits still in the $30 million to $40 million range for the year. We expect a similar trend as we look at the second half of this year to the prior year with the third quarter delivering lower profits than the fourth quarter. We expect the timing of our Rialto Mortgage Finance securitizations to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.","And let me just reiterate the reminder of our previously stated goals for 2014. We continue to expect approximately 25 basis points of potential improvement for SG&A for all of 2014 over 2013. Financial Services is still expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million of operating earnings. Our multifamily operations are still expecting startup losses of $15 million to $20 million, which includes one or two apartment community sales later this year. We are not expecting any significant joint venture or land sale activity in 2014 and these categories should be about breakeven. We haven\u2019t changed our tax rate expectations for the year at 37% and our net community count is still expected to end the year in the range of 600 to 625 communities.","With that, let me turn it over back to the operator for any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk about community count by segment a little bit and just saw some of the trends there, you had some pretty divergent absorption paces across your different segments, so I just wanted to try to understand what was occurring in those a little bit better?","Jon Jaffe","Hi, it\u2019s Jon Jaffe. We saw our community count growth the greatest in California and Texas, followed by Nevada and Colorado and it was a little slower this quarter in the East and then our Houston regions.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then second question was on incentives, they have been relatively flat for four quarters in a row now roughly 6%ish, do you think that\u2019s where they will stabilize or do you think there is more room for that to fall in the future?","Jon Jaffe","This is Jon again. I think as we came out of the first quarter and we saw our sales pace pickup from 2.8 sales per month to 3.7, we found we didn\u2019t have to use any additional incentives to achieve that sales pace and to maintain our margins. And we will continue to operate that way on a community by community basis. And it\u2019s as expected, the market continues the slow and steady growth. You should expect that our incentive should be in that range.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim of Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks very much. I was wondering I guess first in terms of the comments there on margins for the third and fourth quarter, is some of that driven by sort of the changes also in terms of backlog conversion and sort of some operating leverage there or is there an expectation that sort of absent those issues just that margins will be higher in the fourth quarter than the third?","Rick Beckwitt","This is Rick. We generally throughout the year see a progression in our margins from Q1 to Q4. Some of it has to do with what has been left in backlog that hasn\u2019t converted as you pointed out. Typically as we move through the year we can push pricing, but our ability to raise prices is starting to slowdown given that the significant ramp up year-over-year in ASPs.","Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks. And then I guess the second question would be, we've have heard some other companies talk about somewhat favorable trends in March or relatively favorable for a bit of slowing in April and May, is that consistent with what you saw as the quarter went on?","Rick Beckwitt","With regard to sequential improvement, April was our least. It was sort of the slowest month, but not dramatically different than March and May. May was the strongest month on a year-over-year basis.","Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Stephen East of ISI Group. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Stephen East - ISI Group","Thank you. Congratulations guys. Stuart, you talked a little bit about balancing out pace versus price. And if you look at what\u2019s going on in some of the demand trends regionally, Houston jumps out at you, Southeast Florida and California. I was wondering what was going on in some of those key markets from a demand perspective and how you all are looking at pricing? Has pricing gone too far? I noticed three of your regions were down quarter-over-quarter on pricing. So, just trying to understand those relationships?","Stuart Miller","Let me start and then I will ask Jon and Rick to kind of jump in also relative to specific markets, but overall Steve, I\u2019ve said a number of times that I think it\u2019s really relevant that rental rates continue to run higher than fully loaded monthly payments on for-sale product and rental rates have continued to move up. So, there seems to be kind of a push on pricing across kind of the platform. And it\u2019s moving in fits and starts a little bit as you go through the course of the year. And so it\u2019s really incumbent on us and other builders as well to just carefully manage and stay close to the market as it relates to balancing pricing and pace.","As noted, there is not a lot of land available to replace communities that are depleted. So, as rental rates are moving, it\u2019s kind of dictating a little bit, where pricing is going on the for-sale side of the business. The for-sale side could probably ramp up volume a lot more, if it held pricing back, but the replacement of communities is very difficult. Land values as you know are stronger than they have been, so that balance of pace and price is a very local matter, each market is a little bit different. But if you take kind of a 30,000 foot view the general trend is still towards the upside.","Jon Jaffe","And this is Jon, Steve. I would add that even within markets, sub-markets can be very different and we do watch this balance very carefully community by community. But as you noted our California was up both in \u2013 our growth in community count and sales pace and margin and that market has definitely felt stronger during the quarter than some other markets. Florida, Southeast Florida was also up in average sales price year-over-year, not so much in community count. So we just managed those differently based on what we see in the marketplace, based on what we are bringing online. And also the overall market growth in the community count. So for example Phoenix which we all know was softer had tremendous community count growth in the overall marketplace with sort of flattish activity and that\u2019s why you saw sales pace drop in the Phoenix and accordingly you didn\u2019t see any price appreciation there.","Stephen East - ISI Group","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And Stuart you mentioned about land buying and it makes it a bit tougher. As you look at your house price appreciation stagnates in all of that, what are you seeing as the implications on the land side and what you are seeing that pencils that type of thing and are you now at the point where entry level land is becoming more and more of a focus as you move forward?","Stuart Miller","Well, look I think you always have to keep in mind that land value is a residual of what you can build on it. Land values don\u2019t really just move aggressively on their own, sometimes they get ahead of themselves just like any other pricing mechanism. But at the end of the day it\u2019s all a residual calculation of what you are going to be able to build on the land, what market is going to desire a particular location that\u2019s going to drive what products you build on the land and what you can afford to pay for it. And ultimately land prices find their way to that kind of equilibrium. So on a market by market basis and within markets in particular locations land prices move sometimes with momentum and pull back a little bit. It\u2019s been my experience and I think it\u2019s the experience in the marketplace today that we are able to continue to purchase land for a product that is going be able to be built on that land. And whether it\u2019s for first-time buyers maybe a little farther out from the best locations or whether it\u2019s for the move-up buyer in the A locations, it really comes down to a residual calculation. Rick maybe you could add some color to that.","Rick Beckwitt","Yes, I think in your response \u2013 the other thing I would point out Steve is that we continued to be contracting and tying up parcels one year, two years out, so we still have the ability to buy on a wholesale basis. If you look at our land cost as a percentage of ASP it stayed relatively constant in that 20% to 21% of sales price which allows to have a really strong margin. We noticed in the quarter that our land development spend increased pretty significantly on a year-over-year basis. And that\u2019s really the \u2013 that\u2019s really evidencing the fact that we have got some land and we tied up or moving that through the process right now which gives us a lot of confidence that our margins are going to be holding up pretty good.","Stuart Miller","At the end of the day as you see home prices move up you are probably seeing land prices move up. If land prices move up with a little bit more momentum and home prices stagnate those land prices are going to drift back downward ultimately as well. So I think that our margins able to still strive even as home prices might not be accelerating quite as much as they were.","Stephen East - ISI Group","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eli Hackel of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. First question just wanted to focus on multifamily for a minute, pipeline continues to grow pretty aggressively, you said you would be able to be a little bit more consistent I guess in the second half of next year. I was wondering what was driving that, were you able to find the long-term land partner, are these buildings already sold and that what gives you the confidence. And I just wanted to confirm I know in the past you said you are able to generally get maybe 150 basis point spread from the build to self cap rate, is that still generally the case?","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. This is Rick. I think what gives us the visibility in the consistency of the earnings going into the back half of 2015 really stems from when we started our communities. As Stuart highlighted in his opening remarks today we have about 17 communities that are either complete, two of which are completed the rest of which are under some stage of construction. As we look at the balance of this year we will probably start an additional 20 communities plus or minus and that gives you the sort of a runway with regard to how long it takes to build, lease them up and stabilize and then potentially sell them. So we know when we have started and we will see where the lease up progression is and that allows us to really track the building cycle and when we can sale up.","Stuart Miller","Let me add to that and say, I think about our apartment business as kind of a manufacturing plant. It has a fairly long lead time in production and the startup period which we are going through now takes probably 2.5 years to from start to stabilization and sale of an apartment community. The startup period has been a couple of years in the making. We are just getting to the point where we\u2019re delivering our first few coming off the assembly line. And as we get to the back half of 2015, we started to have enough product that has been started is in the pipeline and is moving through in orderly fashion to where we are going to be able to refine the visibility that we can bring from this part of our company. Now the long lead time in today\u2019s market where rental rates have been moving up fairly aggressively and it seems like they are going to continue to really reflects on our initial underwriting having been low and our execution likely to be very strong.","Rick Beckwitt","And the second part of your question was yield on cost versus exit cap. We are still targeting that 150 basis point to 200 basis points.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs","Great, that\u2019s extremely helpful. And then just quickly one follow up Stuart just want to get your latest thoughts on lending standards and maybe what you are seeing over the past couple of months suppose maybe now what\u2019s speeches you have talked to some of friends in the banking sector?","Stuart Miller","Lending standards are still tight. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how the change in leadership at the FHFA is going to actually translate to the market. We still have the stickiness I think of a banking and mortgage banking industry that is having difficulty getting over the penalty phase of the downturn that we have endured and that penalty Phase is really relevant and because to the extent that people see or they put back risk is great and really political and social risk is also great meaning reputational risk it\u2019s hard for the lenders to get back in the business lending on a rational and reverted to normal kind of underwriting standard.","I have listened to a number of people speak recently from various parts of the government and there is this kind of consistent reframe that we need to loosen mortgage standards. But we don\u2019t want to go back to the excesses of 2006. Every time I hear that we don\u2019t want to go back to excesses of 2006, the fact that they throw that caveat in there is reflective of the fact that they don\u2019t realize just how far field we are from that. And that reversion to normal is indeed even close to them. And so I feel that that\u2019s still an impediment to a big move and opening up liquidity in the mortgage market. I think it\u2019s going to be a slow after margin adjustment that\u2019s going to take place over time. Now on the negative side, it means it\u2019s going to be difficult to really liberate the first time homebuyer and get them back into the marketplace. On the positive side relative to us, people need a place to live and our rental program still looks very attractive to us.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s extremely helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Goldberg of UBS. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","David Goldberg - UBS","Thanks. I appreciate guys taking the call and good morning. I am \u2013 I wanted to ask a bit of a theoretical question, I guess and it\u2019s delving a little bit into the comments that you made, Stuart, about being well-positioned for when the entry level comes back and having the right land position to meet that buyer segment? And what I am trying to figure out is there is so much uncertainty about what the entry level coming back is going to look like? And I am trying to figure out how you underwrite land positions accordingly. I mean, we don\u2019t know what price is going to look like, we don\u2019t know what absorptions are going to look like. And so I am just trying to get an idea as you do buy new land that focuses on the entry level where you don\u2019t necessarily have great comps in kind of nearby communities, how do you think about risk control in that environment?","Stuart Miller","I am going to turn this over to Rick and then Jon, because they have in their areas really crafted our land strategy. And we have navigated these waters pretty well to-date thinking about where the market is going and crafting a land strategy to that. And likewise, relative to a first time homebuyer strategy, I think that they have been completely on top of this and thinking it through comprehensively. So, Rick, why don\u2019t you start?","Rick Beckwitt","Okay. It really has to do with price and affordability and commuting corridors if you will. We have taken a very, not aggressive, but thoughtful path in tying up a bunch of property that we could ultimately build on. So, most of the stuff that we are talking about is smaller, it\u2019s money deposits where we have tied up parcels of land, some of which is finished, some of which is would need to be developed with an aim towards building relatively low-priced homes in those markets for the first-time buyer. We know where the commuting path will be. We have a good idea of how far they want to drive. They aren\u2019t in the heart of where our current communities are, because the land isn\u2019t priced accordingly. And we have just done a lot of market research to see where things would comp out and appraise and more importantly focused on what we need to put into the homes to construct them at a price to sell them to them at a good value, but that\u2019s essentially what we have been doing.","Jon Jaffe","And then in the West, David, it\u2019s a strategy really leads us to the product that we have been focusing on, because the price of the land tends to be a lot higher. There isn\u2019t the quick availability, like Arizona, Texas, where the strategy is well-executed that Rick articulated for that land. So, that the market, the thick part of the market is really the move-up market today and that\u2019s where our land buying strategy has been focused. And we keep a very close eye on the tertiary markets, which will feed that first time buyer market as to what\u2019s available and how to bring it on, but we are not really taking the risk today and until that market presents itself as more viable.","Stuart Miller","So, I think what you heard in my comments is we are fully aware that there is a first time homebuyer market out there that is waiting to be able to be activated. It is dependent on mortgage lending standards opening up kind of reverting to normal. We have recognized that once it\u2019s activated, it is a market that has a great deal of pent-up demand. We also recognized that today\u2019s millennial generation has not yet quite defined itself. Is it going to be focused on something that\u2019s more in the middle the city focused or are they going to be building their family by getting married and having children maybe a little bit later in life, but nonetheless still looking for suburban lifestyle. We have developed a land strategy that\u2019s really crafted on creating as much optionality for ourselves in that space as possible looking at different alternatives and preparing products for when that market presents itself. But with that said we are focused on a current basis on the deepest, thickest part of the market which is the first time move up and regular move up buyer and we stand ready to address the first-time buyer as they are activated.","David Goldberg - UBS","Thank you for the color. That\u2019s very helpful. As a follow-up I was wondering if you guys can talk about cycle times and I guess the question as you know with the weather-related delays and some of the push in closings to fourth quarter, are you finding opportunities to cut cycle times in more of a flat market now relative to where we were \u2013 when we were maybe growing a little bit more quickly?","Jon Jaffe","Hi, this is Jon, David. I don\u2019t think that the weather really affected cycle times, it did push things out. I would say what we are seeing as the markets mature is cycle time is flattening. In some places we are able to improve it a little bit and in some places it might slide a little bit. Labor, varies by market as well and most of our markets labor is stabilized which allows us to stabilize the cycle time and in Texas we have seen a lot of activity, labor is tighter and so it\u2019s a little bit harder there. So really the market by market issue is a big focus of our company, cycle time from a perspective of the quality of the home and the quality of process for our homebuyers. And we are trying to find ways to be more efficient, but in general I would say it\u2019s just pretty stable out there.","David Goldberg - UBS","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Thank you. Good morning guys. Good quarter. Stuart you talked about the demographics and short-term strategy with multifamily being obviously another say tool in your tool box and I believe you told me at one point that maybe Rialto you had several hundred units that were single-family rented, I am wondering what your view on single-family rental is given the more cautious view you have of the renting environment normalizing and whether or not that would be an added part of your growth strategy going forward as you appreciate the deficit in shelter?","Stuart Miller","Well, first of all yes. We probably had single-family rentals through our Rialto, distress portfolios before the rest of market really focused on it. And we had a real opportunity to look at how scattered single-family homes would rent and how they would be managed and of course that business has taken off and it\u2019s been a very successful part of some large fund managers operations and programs going forward. I still think that there are complications in managing a diverse array of products and buildings that are located in scattered locations. But given the fact that we have a long-term production deficit in this country in terms of the amount of homes multi and single-family homes that have been delivered over the past few years since we went into the downturn and we kind of estimate that that\u2019s about $4 million in deficit over the past few years.","It seems to me that all product types high tide is rising out both all product types are going to continues to do okay and be pretty strong simply because there is a demand for places for people to live and there is a scarcity of that shelter. So the single-family rental opportunity is a good one. I think it\u2019s difficult to manage. But it\u2019s highly, highly desirable for people who are growing families and need a place to live. The desire to live in the single-family dwelling is very attractive and the inability to get a mortgage augers in favor of renting versus purchasing. So even with the difficulty of management that business is strong.","Our apartment business we think is a very strong business. It\u2019s easier and efficient to manage. We think that our bottom line is going be very strong. And whether there is an opportunity in the future to do single-family for rent is something that we have looked at, it\u2019s something that we are considering and we will see as we go forward. I think a little bit of that and the answer to that will depend on how the mortgage market evolves in the near-term. You know that it\u2019s my view that it\u2019s evolving fairly slowly. I know that there are those including yourself, Ivy that think that it might be coming on a little bit faster. And I leave a lot of room for that to possibly play out more the way other see it than the way that I see it, but if it doesn\u2019t, then I think the single-family development for rent might become a part of our program going forward.","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. I guess my second question really pertains to the level of incremental supply that\u2019s coming through the top MSAs, where you compete and maybe Jon or Rick can comment on this question? There has been a lot of concern about the level of supply in Phoenix and the pressure that we have seen given the softness in sales and level of pricing pressure. Are there other markets that you think are at risk or do you think there was more of anomaly that Phoenix had some specific drivers that mitigate that in other markets sort of similarly following, I know Stuart you have commented very, very eloquently that there is a very significant deficit of supply, but we do have a lot of growth from the industry as they have loaded up their pipelines with developed lots that they are now going to be opening double-digit increases throughout the builder community for new stores. So, are there any markets that you think that will be following Phoenix\u2019s slowing?","Stuart Miller","I think Phoenix was somewhat of an outlier, Ivy. In that, you had as you know significant price appreciation in the prior year and it led to a lot of activity of bringing new communities online at a time where that price depreciation couldn\u2019t be sustained and volume did not pick up as expected. And I think there are some political factors in Arizona that affected that as well that slowed down job growth from where we thought it was going to be. Don\u2019t see those kind of dynamics in other places. And in the West, it\u2019s not so easy to bring land on fast. I really don\u2019t see that, in Texas, where you can bring land on a little quicker, the absorptions are really kept pace and the job growth is really strong. So, I think in a market like Texas, they don\u2019t see that risk either.","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Can I sneak in one quick one just on absorption pace, you said 3.7, I think you said slow and steady recovery, Stuart. What\u2019s the right \u2013 what would be this right number for us to think of a normal pace per community, because we used to think 3.5 to 4 was normal?","Stuart Miller","Yes. I think historically 3.5 to 4 is kind of the normal zone, but I think that 1.5 million starts per year is the normal zone also and there are lot of normal historical patterns that we are not seeing right now. I think going back to your prior question and answering this one as well, I think we have got to think in terms of ebb and flow in the market \u2013 in the market that we are in. We are going to see markets that get a little ahead of themselves. Pricing is an area that starts to move very quickly and you end up with sticker shock that can be coincident pricing and interest rate sticker shock as interest rates move back and forth. Purchasers in certain markets might find that they want to purchase, but they just can\u2019t get over the sticker shock for a period of time. I still think that the dominant theme is production deficit. And over time, I think there was going to be an evening, a reversion back to some of the more normal trends like a 3.5 to 4 homes per community per month absorption rate, but I think that we are still going to see it ebb and flow as markets kind of find their way to slow steady recovery, but pricing gets ahead of itself or desirability falls off for a period of time. And we will just have to kind of wade our way through some of these numbers.","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Jade Rahmani - KBW","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Do you expect the pace of year-over-year orders growth to pickup in the back half since comps get somewhat easier than what we have seen in the first half?","Stuart Miller","We would expect that would likely be the case, Jade, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see how the market unfolds.","Jade Rahmani - KBW","Okay, thanks. Switching to Rialto, I just want to find out if you could comment on the timing of recognizing the carried interest into income? And also if you could comment on what drove the sequential pickup in joint venture income?","Stuart Miller","The carried interest, Jade, we would expect to be able to book that once it\u2019s served in, which is when it comes in, which we still expect on Fund I to be out in the 2016 timeframe at the earliest.","Jeff Krasnoff","Yes, this is Jeff. I would confirm that 2016\/2017 before they start coming in. And then what drove the joint venture income was the fair value in the funds, that\u2019s coming from our real estate funds primarily. So, each quarter we go through a fair value and whatever that increase in value is, is booked through the equity and the earnings line.","Stuart Miller","Yes. And the fair value includes actual operating earnings as well from the ventures. So, it\u2019s really the bottom line of the ventures and it\u2019s our share of the \u2013 as a limited partner in those ventures and we had a good couple of quarters.","Jade Rahmani - KBW","Okay. So it\u2019s essentially your 15% interest in the funds?","Stuart Miller","Yes, it\u2019s less than that. It\u2019s about 11% in the first fund and about 8% in the second fund.","Jade Rahmani - KBW","Okay, thanks a lot.","Stuart Miller","Thank you. And in difference of those who want to watch the soccer game, I think it starts at noon, doesn\u2019t it? I think we will take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. You mentioned limited land availability in the release and so I wanted to see if you could walk us through what you meant by that? Is this in specific geographic areas or is this like infill or are you talking about developed lots, some further clarity on that would be great?","Stuart Miller","Sure. I think that it\u2019s been well-documented that as we went through the downturn, just like the homebuilders were impaired, every land developer or land purchaser found their positions to be impaired and the downturn basically shutdown all entitlement and development activity. And of course, you don\u2019t just restart that engine development and entitlement take years, especially in your most desirable markets. It actually takes years and it takes capital. So, there has been some land that has come back to the marketplace, but the entitlement process and the development process has been very slow to start. Those that are well-capitalized can engage these processes, but there have been fewer groups, primarily the large homebuilders that do have the capital to undertake undeveloped land and get that land position for actually getting building permits.","Smaller landowners, historically, active developers have not been able to get engaged in the financing market and therefore have not assumed their traditional role of developing land that\u2019s available for builders to be able to build. So, land continues to be tight across the country, particularly in the markets where land entitlement is most constrained as places like California, places like Florida, the entire Eastern seaboard number of places, it\u2019s very hard to get land activity up and running again. And that\u2019s what produces the constraint. And the land of course that is available and is developed or entitled becomes much more expensive, because there is a shortage and a need to build in some of those areas.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. And one other question I had was since you guys are uniquely positioned to be, you have the single-family and the multifamily perspectives, what are your thoughts on the share of multifamily as a percentage of overall starts going forward? As firstly we kind of meet a mid-cycle level call it maybe 1.5 million in a few years, do you think that the multifamily side is going to have a greater share than in prior cycles or do you think that kind of what\u2019s going on now with rents rising at a fairly rapid pace that\u2019s going to kind of die out at a certain point and then you were going to have a much of kind of a normal single-family percentage of total starts kind of call it mid-cycle?","Stuart Miller","I think it\u2019s an interesting question and we are all going to have to stay tuned. Right now, multifamily is making up about a third of all starts, which is an historical high, but realistically, multifamily is operating or trending to exactly its traditional zone of 300,000 to 400,000 starts per year. It\u2019s just that single-family is awfully low right now. And so we are as an industry we are going to have to wait and see a lot of it depends on how the mortgage market evolves and whether it begins to enable the buyer to come back to the market, especially the first time buyer to come back to the market.","As things stand right now, if you think about the math we have trended in homeownership from a high of 69.2% homeownership rate down to something like a 64.7% homeownership rate. And every 1 percentage point move in homeownership rate translates into 1.3 million households either doubling up or looking for a rental. So, we have shifted a lot of demand away from for-sale and into the rental housing market. Some have articulated the belief that the homeownership rate will continue to fall. There are some outliers that say that it could fall as low as 55%, I don\u2019t believe that, but whether it continues to trend the percentage point of the time, we will have to wait and see, but that will define the percentage of total starts that are multifamily or primarily rental versus for-sale.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. We appreciate the perspectives.","Stuart Miller","Okay. Alright, well, thanks everyone for joining us for our second quarter update. We look forward to joining you again for third quarter results.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart Miller ","Great. Thank you and good morning everyone. Thank you, David, and thank you all for joining us for our second quarter conference call. This morning, we are in New York City at our Rialto Capital office for our Board meeting yesterday and for today\u2019s conference call. ","I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Rick Beckwitt and Jon Jaffe are here along with Jeff Krasnoff and other members of our management team as well. Some will join in for our Q&A period.","This morning, I'm going to be very brief in my opening remarks, as I feel that our views about the market have been consistently expressed on prior calls. Bruce is going to jump in and breakdown our financial detail and then, as always, we'll open up for Q&A. And as always we'd like to request that during Q&A, each person please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","So, let me go ahead and begin and begin by saying that we're very pleased to report our second quarter results, as we continue to perform consistently across our platform. Our performance reflects our excellent management teams, some of whom are here with us this morning, executing their well-crafted operating strategy in a solid macro environment. ","As we\u2019ve grown our business in the wake of the economic downturn. Lennar has become not only the most profitable homebuilder in the business, but we continue to grow and mature our additional business segments that represent significant opportunity for the future. Simply put, Lennar has become much more than just a homebuilder. ","With that said, it\u2019s still the home building macro environment that defines our core operating strategy across our company. As we noted in many of our prior conference calls, and some of our other public statements, we continue to believe that we are still in the early stages of a multi-year, slow but steady housing recovery.","This year\u2019s spring selling season confirms that the market is continuing to improve at a very consistent pace. Over the past couple of years in our conference calls and public statements, we\u2019ve noted a number of themes that define the uniqueness of this recovery, and they\u2019ve informed our operating strategies. ","Let me briefly review some of those themes: First, the production deficit of both rental and for sale homes relative to the need for housing in the United States continues to create pent-up demand against a very limited supply.","Without a dramatic increase in the number of homes built in this country, we will continue to be short dwelling units per growing population, supply is limited and demand is building. ","Next, the regulatory environments for mortgages remains challenging and limits the number of entrants for the for sale market. QM and QRM rules together with ATR, the ability to repay rules, continue to restrict qualified purchasers from accessing the mortgage market. ","While these rules have been evolving and easing at the margin, they have exacerbated and already impaired consumer psychology to create a perception that home ownership just might not be desirable. Demand is slowly coming back to the market.","Third, the millennial generation is changing a lot of thinking. Their attitudes are proving to be different and the doubling up of the millennials during the downturn will ultimately unwind and give way to household formation. ","We\u2019ve already seen evidence that this is beginning to happen and household formation is beginning to grow. While new households might not be able to or desire to purchase a home, they will need a place to live and rental might be their only option. ","Fourth, first time purchasers have begun coming back to the housing market more slowly than expected and more slowly than they have historically. They\u2019ve had the most difficult accessing the mortgage market, credit limitations have been most constraining to the first time buyers, and although that is beginning to open up as many have reported, they are not yet jumping in to the market place and they are also the most susceptible to price and interest rate increases. ","Finally, a slow steady recovery with limited land supply and limited access to capital, constrains the number of smaller, less capitalized home builders that can compete for the smaller demand. This has enabled the larger better capitalized builders to pick up a larger portion of the smaller pie.","Overall, this is a very favorable environment to be a well-capitalized national home builder. We have believed and continue to believe that the down side in the housing market is very limited and the up side is very significant. ","We believe that the market is downside supported by the production deficit that has yielded a limited supply of both rental and for sale housing in the country. Any pullback in the housing market will be short lived as there is a need for shelter across the country and there\u2019s very little inventory and almost no likelihood of mortgage foreclosures given the stringent underwriting standards of the pas years. ","And while demand has remained constrained, buyers have continued a steady return to household formation and home ownership as the market opens up, driven by consistently low interest rate and now higher wages and lower unemployment. ","These are the themes that have continued to define our operating strategies across the company. In home building, we have continued to focus our attention primarily on the higher end first time buyer and the move-up market, as our average sales prices reached an historical record high of $348,000 this quarter.","While approximately 25% of our home building business continues to be geared to first time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has been aimed at the rental market. Our $6 billion apartment strategy is proving to be very well timed, as rental rates are soaring and vacancies are at historical lows, driven by supply-demand imbalance. ","Our financial services group has continued to expand alongside our primary housing business, while we\u2019ve expanded our retail platform to become the 5th largest retail, non-bank lender in the nation, and we are able to capture an expanded share of the refi business as it exists. ","With that large scale infill community strategy in five points, we\u2019ve positioned ourselves to benefit from some of the best located land in California, as that market continues to improve. ","And finally, our Rialto Capital Asset Management platform enables us to invest across real estate and financial product types, as an opportunistic play on this long duration recovery. In conclusion, we are very pleased to present our second quarter results this morning, and we are confident that we have the right people, the right programs, and the right timing to continue to perform this year and in to the future.","Let me turn it over to Bruce. ","Bruce Gross","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were 183 million, which is a 33% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 30% in the second quarter, driven by a 20% increase in wholly owned deliveries and an 8% year-over-year increase in average selling price to 348,000.","Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 23.8%, and we are still on track with our goal of 24% for the full year. The prior year\u2019s gross margin percent of 25.5% included a $9.6 million benefit relating to insurance recoveries and other non-recurring items which benefited the gross margin percent by 60 basis points.","Sales incentives declined sequentially from 6.3% in the first quarter to 5.8% in the second quarter, and from 5.9% in the prior year. The gross margin decline year-over-year was also due to increase land cost. ","Year-over-year labor and material costs are up approximately 7% to $52 per square foot. This is consistent with the year-over-year change that we noted in the first quarter. We have a continued focused effort on reducing cost due to commodity declines primarily in lumber, copper and steel. We are still seeing offsetting labor and manufacturing pressures across products and geographies. ","Our previously stated guidance was to achieve a 15 to 25 basis point improvement in the combined SG&A and corporate G&A lines for all of 2015. In this quarter, we exceeded that guidance as SG&A improved 80 basis points over the prior year. This was primarily driven by operating leverage resulting from this quarter\u2019s organic growth, as our 30% increase in home sale revenue came out of our existing 31 home building divisions. ","Our corporate G&A lines was 2.1% as a percentage of total revenues. The operating leverage on this line was offset by increased investments in technology, as we are focused on improving productivity in all aspects of our business.","Gross profit on land sales totaled 3.5 million versus 5.6 million in the prior year, and equity and earnings from unconsolidated subs was 6.5 million in the second quarter, which was primarily driven by the sale of commercial land at our El Toro joint venture to Broadcom.","This was partially offset by operating expenses and other joint ventures. Other interest expense declined year-over-year from 10.3 million in the prior year to 3.8 million in the current quarter. This quarter we opened 96 new communities to end the quarter with 667 active communities. ","Our sales pace improved to 3.8 sales per community per month in the second quarter versus 3.7 in the prior year, and in the second quarter, we purchased approximately 6000 home sites totaling 445 million versus 379 million in the prior years\u2019 quarter. ","We have been continuing to focus on targeting shorter duration land purchases as part of our soft pivot strategy, however this quarter it also included the strategic acquisition of a mixed used parcel totaling 151 million adjacent to the Tesla car plant in Fremont, California. ","Our home site count for owned and controlled now totals 168,000 home sites, of which 133,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1000 homes which in our normal range of one to two per community. ","Our financial services business segment had strong results with operating earnings increasing to 39.1 million from 18.3 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to 33.5 million from 16.7 million in the prior year. The increased mortgage earnings were due to higher volume as mortgage originations increased 72% to 2.4 billion, from 1.4 billion in the prior year.","The increased volume resulted from a strong refinanced market, as well as further expansion of our retail channel, more home closings by Lennar, and higher capture rate of Lennar home buyers. ","The capture rate of Lennar home buyers improved to 82% this quarter from 77% in the prior year. The expansion of our retail channel has positioned us to capitalize on the strong refinance market this quarter, refinance volume increased by over 300% versus the prior year to 450 million in originations. However approximately 80% of our total originations this quarter were related to purchase volume.","With the recent increase in mortgage rates, we don\u2019t expect the refinance activity to continue at the pace of the first half of this year; however we are still well positioned to capture additional purchase business as the housing recovery continues. ","Our title company\u2019s profit increased to 5.1 million in the quarter from 2.2 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher volume and benefits from strategic initiatives including closing of less productive branches over the past year. Our title team continues to focus on maximizing the title opportunities within our ancillary businesses.","Turning to Rialto, our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings totaling 7.6 million, compared to 13.4 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interest. The investment management business contributed 30.4 million of earnings which includes 7.3 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and 23.1 million of management fees and other which included 4.8 million of a carried interest distribution from Rialto Real Estate Funds to cover the income tax obligation resulting from the allocations of taxable income to Rialto. ","The carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I under a hypothetical liquidation now stands at a 108 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance continues to generate consistent earnings. This quarter they contributed 721 million of commercial loans in to three securitizations, resulting in earnings of 29 million for the quarter before their G&A expenses. ","Our liquidating direct investments had a loss of 3.1 million, and Rialto, G&A and other expense were 41.9 million for the quarter and interest expense including warehouse lines was 7 million.","Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with over 176 million of cash. Our Multifamily operations continued to grow. We now have over 230 associates located in regional offices nationwide. ","We ended the quarter with two completed and operating communities, 24 communities under construction, six of which are in lease-up, totaling over 6600 apartments with a total development cost of approximately 1.6 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceed 6 billion and over 20,000 apartments. ","As expected there were no sales in the second quarter, and we had an operating loss of approximately 8.7 million.","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34.2% and our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong, as our homebuilding and cash balance ended the quarter at 639 million and during the quarter we increased our credit facility to 1.6 billion which includes a 263 million accordion and also extended the term to 2019 and reduced the interest rate. ","There was 450 million outstanding under this facility at quarter end, and our leverage improved this quarter as well by 50 basis points year-over-year, as our homebuilding net debt-to-total cap was reduced to 47.5%. ","We grew stockholders equity of 17% year-over-year to 5.1 billion, and at quarter end our book value per share increased to $25.04 per share. ","During the quarter, we issued 500 million of 4.75% senior notes due in May of 2025. This issuance extended our debt maturity ladder, continued to reduce our borrowing rate and further strengthened the company\u2019s financial condition. ","Finally I wanted to update our goals for 2015. Starting with deliveries; we are increasing our delivery expectations for 2015 to between 24,000 and 24,500 homes. With the recent rains in the central region, we experienced some minor construction delays at the front end of construction and therefore we are updating our backlog conversion ratio to approximately 75% for the third quarter and a range of 90%-95% for the fourth quarter.","Second, we still expect our gross margin in 2015 to average 24% for the full year. Our third quarter gross margin is expected to be close to what we just saw in the second quarter, while the fourth quarter is expected to be a little bit higher. ","Third, we are increasing our expectations on corporate G&A and SG&A leverage, as we are now expecting potential improvement for these combined categories to 30-40 basis points at you look at the full 2015 fiscal year. ","Fourth, financial services, we are increasing our goal for financial services earnings, to earn 100 million to 110 million for the full year, included in this increase guidance is the expectation of some cooling in the strong refinance market in the second half of this year. The remaining quarterly amounts are expected to be spread similar to last year. ","Rialto is still expected to generate profits between 30 million and 40 million for the year and that\u2019s weighted a little more heavily to the fourth quarter, and our Multifamily operations as we\u2019ve seen strong rent growth in our lease-up communities, our partners have decided to maximize the sell price in two of our rental communities and therefore we are moving the sale of two communities in to early 2016.","We are now expecting three communities to be sold in 2015, one in Q3 and two in Q4. We expect a small loss in Q3; however, Q4 should mark the start of consistent quarterly profitability for our Multifamily segment. ","Next our joint ventures in land sales we continue to expect closer to breakeven bottom line for our joint ventures in Q3 and Q4 and we are on track with approximately 25 million of wholly-owned land sale profit for the full 2015 with the bulk of the remainder forecasted for the fourth quarter. ","Our tax rate is still expected to be between 34% and 34.5%, and we are right on track to hit our goal of 675 net communities by the end of the year. With these goals in mind and backlog dollar value up 23%, we are well positioned to deliver strong topline and bottom line growth throughout the remainder of the year. ","Let me now turn it back to the operator for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Mr. Stephen Kim with Barclays. Sir your line is now open. ","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys. Strong results, good to see. Thanks for all the details, well done on the guidance. A couple of questions, the first question I think that\u2019s probably is on everybody\u2019s mind is, with the strong order pace that you\u2019ve seen, if you could provide a little bit of color around, particular market segments I would say, in particular the entry level, what are you seeing there in a way that you could possibly break out for us. And then also surrounding the order question, are you seeing an ability to sort of raise prices within your communities. If you could sort of comment about that because there obviously a lot of mix shift that kind of comes in to play.","Rick Beckwitt","Sure, Steve, it\u2019s Rick. I would say that across the board in all product types we are getting pricing leverage. It varies by market and by community, but pretty much across the board we\u2019ve seen pricing power. We don\u2019t know how much longer we\u2019ll be able nudge prices up, and consistently as we\u2019ve done in the past balancing pace and price, but we are seeing pricing power. ","And some markets are much stronger, California and Northern California we are seeing great strength. We\u2019ve seen good strength in the central part of the United States. Sales prices were actually up in Houston as well. So we are pretty confident that that\u2019s going to continue. ","Stuart Miller","Steve, this is Stuart, a lot of people are asking about the first time homebuyer, and as Rick noted it\u2019s really across the board that we are seeing improvement across markets. That includes the first time homebuyer. We are starting to see the first time homebuyer come back to the market place, but from basically a very flat level of virtually non-existent first time homebuyer to some beginnings of improvement. ","It feels a lot better, it feels like the first time buyer is coming back but they are not jumping into the market, still constrained by the mortgage market. So we\u2019ll have to kind of sit, watch and wait till the next quarters to see how that first time buyer market continues to evolve. ","As Rick Noted, you are seeing some pricing power and the first time buyer is probably the most sensitive group to price increases and interest rate fluctuation. So I think it\u2019s going to be a push and pull program for some time to come, as pricing power continue to be pretty strong. ","Stephen Kim","Yeah, absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for that. The second question I had, I am going to jump over to the joint venture line. I think you\u2019d mentioned last quarter you are going to have the sale to Broadcom and that building we actually saw that when we were out there. And you mentioned that that gain was offset by some, I think you said expenses in some of the other JVs.","Can you just describe was there something that\u2019s sort of temporary in some of those other JVs that were leading to a loss this quarter that offset the gain from Broadcom, am I understanding that properly? And then also was there anything new to talk about with respect to that [parcel] [ph] that you guys were I think one of two finalists for north of San Fran. I forgot the name of the town, but if you could sort of comment on what you are thinking about the prospects for that. ","Jon Jaffe","Steve, it\u2019s Jon Jaffe. We are - that\u2019s Concord Naval Station and we are still one of the two finalist; that decision won\u2019t be made probably until September by the City Council. ","Stuart Miller","And then going back to the other expenses on the Joint venture line Steve, we did have some start-up expenses with the shipyard community, as we are just at the very beginning of that, and that was the bulk of the offset and that\u2019s something that you are just seeing at the beginning of that community as deliveries start to kick in later this year, we don\u2019t expect that to continue. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mr. Stephen East with ISI. Sir you line is now open.","Stephen East","If we looked at just sort of following on with your ancillary businesses, Stuart if you wouldn\u2019t mind walking us through, you talked about the back half of this year, but as you look at \u201916 with your businesses, what type of cadence do you get out of apartment sales, land sales coming from your JVs.","And what do you still need to do to ultimately monetize Rialto. What type of work do you have left there to recognize some value out of it?","Stuart Miller","Steve, I highlighted at the beginning of this year, as we came in to this year that 2015 would be a significant statement year for the ancillary businesses, and in each one of them we are seeing significant moves towards maturity. I think at FivePoint, you are starting to see Hunters Point come online. I think Bruce highlighted we\u2019ll see deliveries as we get through the back half of this year. We\u2019ve seen a number of deals start to mature.","As we\u2019ve highlighted in prior quarters, and FivePoint is I think a group that most people have gone out and visited and been impressed with that progress. I think as it relates to our apartment communities, the fact that we are postponing two sales of apartments that we had expected to have this year is a distinct positive. ","We have partners that are seeing the improvement in rental rates beyond our underwritten expectations and they\u2019d like to hold on just a little bit longer. So we are going to benefit from rental income but not from the sales of those as we had anticipated. But we are going to see a recurring program of showing apartment communities as we go into 2016, and to sustain profitability there. ","And then of course Rialto, I think the exciting part of Rialto is the successful investment of the first two funds along with the mezzanine fund at very attractive return levels that really marks a reputation in the asset management business that is going to lead right in to Fund III.","We are not going to begin - we\u2019ve begun our raise for Fund III, and we\u2019ll start to see that to come to fruition in the back part of this year. Each of these programs is getting to a level of maturity, to a point where we can start to see not only monetization on the books of the company, but also strategic positioning for these companies for the future. ","I can\u2019t speak specifically about that, but I think that as I said at the beginning of the year, you\u2019ll start to see those plans mature towards the back half of this year and in to 2016.","Stephen East","And then if you look at your land strategy and your land spend, you\u2019ve talked a lot over the last year and a half about soft pivot. Can you give us an idea of where you are in that process, how you are thinking about the market over the next few years and what that implies for your land spend not only this year but as you look in to the next couple of years.","Stuart Miller","Yeah, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time Steve on this soft pivot. A lot of it derives from lessons learned through the last downturn. As the management team and the corporate office and all the way through to the field, we\u2019ve been very focused on shortening what we call, snout and tail, the beginning and ending part of each property that we\u2019re purchasing. ","And while we still see some tremendous opportunities to purchase strategic land parcels in the market, we were first to the market, we have a strategic advantage in that regard. The Fremont purchase that was highlighted by Bruce is a good example of that. ","We\u2019ve been very focused on bringing down the duration of land that we are bringing on our books unless we find a really unique opportunity as with the Fremont property. As we go through \u201915, we are continuing our soft pivot as we\u2019ve defined it. We are continuing to agitate around that, and we feel that in our primary homebuilding business, as we go in to 2016, we fully expect to be cash flow positive even while we grow, and that is in large part derived from the soft pivot. ","We expect as we go forward, we are going to see a very strong program evolve, that is driven by shorter land positions and a strong drive to push efficiencies through the system. ","Stephen East","If I could ask you just quickly on that duration question, if you look at what you are buying today versus say you rewind two years ago, what would be the duration difference between those? ","Stuart Miller","Well you got to realize that we are looking at averages over a companywide foot print. So the Fremont is an example of a much longer duration property, but I think a very, very exciting purchase. And if you look across the platform our average duration of land is probably coming down by about a year, year and a half on the purchase side, as we sit right now today and as we look forward we think we will drive that duration down even further. ","Rick Beckwitt","Steve some of the steps that we are doing is contractually. When we were buying at pennies on the dollar several years back, we were prepared to take on balance sheet and close because we got such significant discount to market. Today rather than closing, right now, we are contracting to close a couple of years down and moving the land through the process. So we are benefiting from wholesale pricing today, but don\u2019t necessarily need to come out of pocket for cash until later. ","Operator","Next question comes from Mr. Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Market. Sir your line is now open. ","Bob Wetenhall","Congratulations on a really strong quarter. I wanted to ask about the conversion rate in 1Q in the last quarter that just passed. It came in higher than our expectations, and if Bruce may be you could touch on, you mentioned rain has been an issue in terms of stopping deliveries at the schedule. How should we think about pace as we move in to the back part of the year. ","Bruce Gross","So Bob we\u2019ve talked about in our central region that this is at the front-end of construction, there was water in parts of Texas and Colorado that delayed some of the start. So, we will catch up but initially we did lower the backlog conversion ration a little bit going in to Q3. But in total, if you look at deliveries for the year, we did increase them by 500 compared to the prior guidance. ","Bob Wetenhall","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And I wanted to ask Stuart and Rick a question, which inning of the cycle do you think we are in? You\u2019ve been referencing the soft pivot strategy, so I am just trying to access how far you are in to this cycle at this point in your estimate. And with that being said, it sounds like some very positive commentary around Multifamily business. What\u2019s the outlook for that in terms of retaining it or possibly spitting it out, and what kind of structures are you thinking about? Thanks very much and good luck.","Stuart Miller","Good, let me take that first Bob and then Rick will follow-up. But I think we\u2019ve said pretty consistently, we think we are in the early stages of this recovery. This has been a slow, steady recovery that\u2019s been defined by pretty shallow levels of production. And those shallow levels of production are creating short supply for a growing demand and we think that as we look ahead, this recovery remains fairly shallow sloped, but consistent for a number of years to come. ","So we feel that we are still in the early innings of this recovery, and have been guiding our company and strategy accordingly. ","Rick Beckwitt","Yeah I think that actually goes for the Multifamily segment as well. The demand for rental properties today is off the chart. So we are seeing rent growth and lease-ups much faster than what we\u2019ve under written, which is one of the reasons I would differ to the sales for two of the properties in the next couple of quarters. ","As we look forward in to 2016 and beyond, we\u2019ve got about 26 properties that have the ability to be sold and monetized during the next couple of years. That doesn\u2019t even bring in to the question, the several billions dollars of pipeline that will be started over the next couple of years. ","We couldn\u2019t be prouder of the team in what we\u2019ve done there and we are going to have to really see what size that thing can get to and what the best options are for our shareholders. ","Stuart Miller","At the end of the day just last comment on that. At the end of the day, as we\u2019ve noted the first time home buyers just starting to come back in to the market place. They are going to start to come back and that\u2019s going to have that upward ripple effect of affecting first time move-ups, second time move-up. ","It really has an upward cascade in the market place, as the first time home buyers starts to come back to the market. This is going to be a slow process because of the mortgage market. Again this market has got a lot of legs. ","Operator","Next question comes from Mr. Michael Rehaut with JPMC. Sir your line is now open. ","Michael Rehaut","First question I had was just, may be if possible, a little more granularity on the Texas market. Aside from the floods you were able to put out similar results to last quarter, and just wanted to get a sense, just given that it still is a topic of interest among investors. ","If you could give us a feel for, last quarter Houston was down 7, this quarter down 9. So a similar rate, if that was driven more by community count or sales pace. And then across the price points or demographic segments, which areas or parts of the market are stronger or weaker. ","Rick Beckwitt","Yeah, it\u2019s Rick. I will tell you generally Texas is a strong market. Starting in Dallas the markets on fire, we\u2019ve got excellent positions throughout the market and we are benefiting from the strong economy that\u2019s in Dallas, and that\u2019s really at our price point. We have a big entry level position there and we are benefiting from that. We\u2019ve got move-up product and we are all over the price points. Austin and San Antonio are good solid markets, and we are well positioned there. ","Houston which is in everyone\u2019s focus, its\u2019 about the same market as it was last quarter. If you look at our gross margins, our gross margins actually increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter. Sales were off about 9% this quarter, but we couldn\u2019t sold more homes. We decided to focus on price as oppose to pace and we are going to continue to do that as the market evolves. ","The entry level market in Houston is strong and getting stronger. When you get to the higher price points in Houston it gets a little bit softer, but that\u2019s not all of the Houston market, it depends where you are. Closer to the oil corridor it\u2019s a little softer. We are seeing huge traffic in the market at those price points. The people are cautious because they don\u2019t know whether they will be laid off or not. ","Stuart Miller","But with all that said, the weather in Houston was interesting this quarter. It was a little rainy, some people heard on the news, and the rains absolutely shut down the market for a number of days during the quarter. There were days where our offices were actually shut down because there was not electricity and the floods were significant. That impacted as Bruce highlighted some of our early stage construction, later construction of course was dried in and we were able to complete those homes. ","So as we look ahead and as Bruce highlighted, that will affect some of our conversion ratio in the next couple of quarters. But really pretty marginal impact in a fairly strong market. ","Michael Rehaut","Appreciate that, and obviously your other regions are doing pretty strong right across the board. So the diversity certainly kicks in as well. Second question, Bruce you had mentioned some of the different line items of guidance and I believer Multifamily you described the strategic position for hold-on. ","I might have missed it but, could you update what the outlook now is for the Multifamily earnings for the full year, if you could just share that. ","Bruce Gross","For the full year, Mike I didn\u2019t put a number out for the full year, but we\u2019ll be close to breakeven possibly a slight of loss now that we\u2019ve shifted two communities in to early 2016. But I think the key thing is that starting in Q4, we will now have a consistent program with this segment that will generate consistent profitability each quarter going forward.","Michael Rehaut","I appreciate that and of course understand the strategy there. But with that last statement though, there\u2019s been talk around whether you would hold on to these apartments and more, just trying work up a lease-up and cash flow type of dynamic or continue to sell them out. You just mentioned that with Q4 with the sale of two building in Q4 now expected that would be the start of a more consistent cash flow generator. ","So is there any shift there because I think over the last quarter or two, I think some of us have been hearing the possibility of maybe not selling as much as you were to expect or had initially expected in terms of actually selling the buildings but more holding on from a cash flow standpoint. Just want to know if there\u2019s any, how you guys are thinking about that today.","Stuart Miller","We highlighted early on with our apartment program that our initial phase would be to define the business through a merchant build type program and that\u2019s what you are seeing us move through right now is a focused merchant build program to establish a platform, to define it in the mind of investor, for people to understand what we were doing and how effective we can be.","We are still going through that initial phase right now, but we\u2019ve highlighted that there would be an evolution of this business as we go forward and as have achieved maturity. You are really asking the question that, how will this business mature as a business, what will its prospects be, how will we define a build and hold strategy. ","And that\u2019s really a question to be answered over the next quarters. I think that we are continuing to identify that merchant build program, but we\u2019ve highlighted that through the course of this year. As this business achieves maturity, we think we\u2019ll be able to bring clarity to how the future will be evolve for the business for this platform. And you can expect that over the next quarters, we will be able to bring that definition to you. ","As it stands right now, I think that we are starting to identify some elements of certainty as to profitability in the early stage, and over the next quarters we\u2019ll give better definition. With all of that said, I think that what you are seeing is a very credible program, in a well-timed addressing of the market condition as they exist, and we are extremely well positioned to bring that definition to this platform. So you will see that over the next couple of quarters. ","Operator","Next question comes from Mr. Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open. ","Alan Ratner","Hey guys it\u2019s actually Allen on for Ivy, so I guess this sure does apply here. Congratulations on the great quarter. Stuart you obviously spent a lot of time detailing the ancillary businesses and we hear the excitement there. If we look at the earnings today, I think 80%-80% plus of you earnings still comes from core homebuilding and in towns like here, you are still very bullish and optimistic about the outlook there. ","So as we look forward two or three years, should we think about that share of earnings between homebuilding and ancillary should that look materially different or are you just kind of expecting these Multifamily Rialto to grow in line with homebuilding and the split between earnings still look pretty similar as we look at a couple of years. ","Stuart Miller","Yeah, so we\u2019ve been very clear that our core business remains our homebuilding and financial services associated businesses. And those will continue to be at the core, the ancillary are opportunities for the future. I think that as we think about our business, our homebuilding business is strong, it has been strong, it\u2019s assumed a leadership position in the homebuilding world, and I think that Jon and Rick has done an incredible job of building a platform that\u2019s continuing to grow and to become more efficient as we go forward. ","I think that the relationship in earnings, as we look ahead, I don\u2019t know that I can identify exactly what the proportions will be. I think that one of the concerns about the ancillary businesses is that they can tend to be somewhat lumpy in the way that their earnings are presented, and they are not easily modeled. ","And because of that I am not easily able to model what the relationship in earnings will be as we go forward. But as homebuilding continues to grow, we think that the ancillaries are going to grow also, and we can\u2019t really lay out exactly what those proportions will be. ","Alan Ratner","Got it. I appreciate that. And a follow-up to your comments on the cash flow and in times like, I don\u2019t know, I think \u201916 was the year where you expect homebuilding cash flow to start inflecting positively and for the company to be a consistent generator of cash for the next several years. ","So as you think about the opportunities with that cash, how would you rank where that cash might go between deleveraging M&A, share buybacks, any other potential usage of that cash.","Stuart Miller","Well, we\u2019ve talked about this in prior calls, so we do expect to be cash generator as we mature the business and those numbers should get bigger over time. We think that the opportunity to deleverage, to return cash to shareholders and to invest further in the platform that we\u2019ve been growing are all equal consideration, and I think we\u2019ll leave those considerations open for when the time comes. ","But I think that you can expect that we have a balanced mindset and thinking about each of those opportunities and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll run the business.","Operator","Next question comes from Mr. Jade Rahmani with KBW. Sir your line is now open. ","Jade Rahmani","Wanted to ask about your views on consolidation in both the homebuilding sector as well as in Rialto business lines?","Rick Beckwitt","So on the homebuilding side; we did see the Ryland and Stan-Pac combination. Think positively at that. With regard to though and our views on consolidation, acquisition, it\u2019s a tough go for us, because we are I think probably the best land acquisition machine out there. ","And when you are buying companies today, you are buying land assets, and we had found that we are able to buy those assets through negotiations with sellers at a cheaper price than acquiring the company and paying the goodwill associated with the company. ","We have continued to look at smaller acquisitions and you can and we\u2019ll continue to do so. But with regards to the larger public companies don\u2019t seem to pencil out for us today.","Jon Jaffe","This is Jon. I would just add that as you look at our geographic landscape, we are well positioned to markets that we want to be in. So we don\u2019t have the need to make an acquisitions to enter new markets or for immediately relative to deliveries. So we are very particular about looking at these opportunities and as Rick said really don\u2019t find that they price very well. ","Stuart Miller","But listen at the same time, there\u2019s an attraction to being part of a larger homebuilder, some of the smaller homebuilders might find that access to capital or [forging] these opportunities, I think that we are going to continue to see consolidation in the industry.","There are likely to be larger scale combinations and may be some smaller ones. I think that positions us particularly well. If you ask traditionally about Rialto, I think that one of the most exciting parts of Rialto is that it has become a formidable force in asset management in deploying capital. ","And the management team infrastructures that Rialto has created is not immediately apparent, but it presents itself as a very attractive combination, M&A kind of platform for a lot of opportunities out there, and we continue to hold Rialto up as an opportunity that can be defined in a lot of ways, not the least of which is through M&A.","Jade Rahmani","Last quarter I think you noted a single family rental community that you would open, I was wondering if you could give an update on that, and if you are seeing any indications positively or negatively towards that sector. ","Stuart Miller","Listen I think that it\u2019s one of the more interesting programs that we have inside the company and in fact this past quarter Jon, Rick and myself jointly went out to review the progress on that community. It\u2019s an unusual engagement. You would think that it\u2019s kind of easy and normal to just build a rental single family community. It\u2019s actually a different and unique animal.","So we are going through some evaluation of how it\u2019s working out. The immediate review that we\u2019ve seen out there is that it\u2019s pretty exciting opportunity for our company. It requires some additional thoughts, some messaging of the floor plans, the management program.","But in a world where single family rental is becoming a more dominant theme and the scattered single family acquirers have shown some metrics that are interesting but nonetheless, the management component is complicated.","This single family rental community is really very exciting to us. We continue to look at it, continue to experiment with it, and we are probably going to launch another one or two as part of our valuation as we go forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mr. Buck Horne with Raymond James. Sir your line is now open. ","Buck Horne","Can you give us a little bit of a color on the monthly progression of the order trend, just as we move through the quarter any comments also you might be able to willing to share on June so far. I guess I am just wondering if we saw any impacts from higher rates caught through the month of May, any signs that higher may uphold some fin feathers in to the market just to get the front of the rate move. ","Jon Jaffe","Hi, this is Jon. We saw a pretty steady activity at our communities throughout the progression of the quarter. Month-over-month they were relatively balanced, so we didn\u2019t see any big swing as commented earlier, just a very healthy spring selling season with strong activity in Florida, California and the part of Pacific Northwest and then very good activity in the rest of our states. ","Didn\u2019t really see any impact from the mortgage adjustment in rates as we went through the month of May, and it\u2019s typical we don\u2019t comment on the current quarter activity.","Buck Horne","Okay, fair enough. And relating to the mortgage market, we had a recent announcement from the CFPB that they were going to postpone changes on or implementation of the [TRS] move until early October. But that\u2019s still on the horizon. How do you guys gauge the potential for any market disruption related to those changes on documentation and closing procedures. How well do you guys think buyers are prepared for that and what impact do you think might happen as a result of those changes? ","Bruce Gross","Well as you Buck, we are capturing 82% right now of our home buying customers within our mortgage company. So as you look at that population we feel very comfortable that our team is going to be putting through the change, testing it, be ready and we are very comfortable that we\u2019ll be in good shape. ","The question is for the remaining percentage whether a smaller mortgage companies or others that have to sell a home, that\u2019s just a question that we\u2019ll have to wait and see if there is any impact there. ","Internally of course we are focused on making sure that we are not as backend loaded in the last few days of a quarter or a month, and trying to be proactive to accelerate that so there is minimal disruption even if some of the other mortgage companies have some issues. ","Stuart Miller","Let me add to that and say that you might or might not know or the investor world might or might not know that Bruce has directly - has been kind of running the dual position of being Chief Financial Officer and running our Financial Services Group. We\u2019ve always had our Financial Services Group run up through our Chief Financial Officer. ","But it\u2019s more significant today because this is a rough and tumble mortgage market that is defined by a regulatory environment that has a lot of laws of unintended consequences coming through. And the new legislation, the new regulations that will come in to affect in October will have some ripple effect. ","We are all over this and Bruce has been heavily focused on thinking through the nuance changes that will come in to the market in anticipation of some minor disruptions. We\u2019ve been fortifying our mortgage company; I think you have seen it in the results from the numbers. But behind the scenes in the operations of our mortgage business, we recognize that there is potential for disruption and we are trying to stay ahead of the curve. ","So we are going to have to wait and see exactly how the implementation comes forward, but we think that we are doing a lot of anticipatory work to really mute any negative impact that can come through in the back half of the year. ","Buck Horne","Thank you. Very helpful guys. Congratulations. ","Stuart Miller","Last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Ms. Susan Maklari with UBS. Ma\u2019am you may proceed.","Susan Maklari","Just building on the last [specific][ph] point, do you think longer term this could sort of change the overall competitive landscape, and perhaps do that such that it favors the larger builders just given your resources and abilities to help buyers with the complexity.","Stuart Miller","As I noted, there are a lot of unintended consequences embedded in some of this legislation or regulation I should say. I think in many of the instances the consequences are that larger players are benefitted and the larger player\u2019s ability to adjust, to adapt and to spend the dollars to be ahead of some of the regulatory changes works to the benefit. We certainly think.","And given the amount of focus that Bruce has put on our Financial Services Group, and preparation for the regulatory changes, I think it does advantage us and thus flat the playing field. ","I think the smaller homebuilders have had difficulty getting up running and engaged in a capital constrained market that has favored larger builders. They\u2019ve had more difficulty accessing land. I think given the fact that we have a large mortgage subsidiary that\u2019s able to do a large portion of our business versus a smaller builder that might have to depend on outside lenders. I think it does additionally slant the table in the larger builders favor. ","Jon Jaffe","Susan this is Jon, I will just add to Stuart\u2019s comment that the mortgage process today is very invasive, very frustrating for the homebuyer, and the close working relationship that you are hearing and Stuart and Bruce described between homebuilding operations and mortgage company ready to sell takes a much better customer experience. ","We track this and we see this in our surveys of our customers, and I think it will result in better referral rates for us and achieving a higher level of capture of more markets as compared to our smaller competitors. ","Susan Maklari","Okay. Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And then in terms of the labor or material side of things, you noted it was up about 7% kind of in line with what you saw in the first quarter. As we look at the back half of the year. I know you\u2019ve been doing [stunts] on some worth to try in. Get some benefits coming through, given the commodity (inaudible)? How should we think about that relative to some of the offset that you\u2019ve been seeing? ","Jon Jaffe","This is Jon. There\u2019s continued pressure, we see it more on the labor side, perhaps than the material side in today\u2019s world especially as start between single family and Multifamily pickup. And so some areas from framing and drywall, masonry, you see pressure there. ","So I think we will continue as an industry to seek pressure on that. So you will see some level price increase as we move forward, and we do love to take advantage of every opportunity whether it\u2019s in lumber, we borrow different material to find moments and time to lock in some pricing to offset that. ","So I think we\u2019ll see that percentage increase sort of slowly moderate down, but I think you should expect to see some continued pressure as we move forward. ","Stuart Miller","Alright, let\u2019s call it there, and look I hope that you are hearing our answers and our tone. We are enthusiastic about our business. Our core homebuilding business and Financial Services Group are well positioned to continue to post strong results as we go forward.","We are enthusiastic about positioning the maturity of our ancillary businesses and look forward to continuing to update you on future quarters as to our progress and to our strategy going forward.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart Miller","Okay. Very good. Thank you, David, and thank you for joining us, everyone. This morning, I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Rick Beckwitt and Jon Jaffe are here as well, along with Jeff Krasnoff, who's the CEO of Rialto, and a few other management members as well. Some will join for our Q&A period.","This morning, I'm going to be brief in my opening remarks as I feel that our views about our the market have been pretty consistently expressed on prior calls. Bruce is going jump in and break down our financial detail, and then, as always, we'll open up to Q&A. And we'd like to request that during Q&A, each person limit yourself to one question, one follow-up so that we can get as many participants as possible.","So let me go ahead and begin. And I'll begin by saying that we are very pleased to report our third quarter results as we continue to perform consistently across our platform. Our performance really reflects our strong management team, executing our strategically crafted operating plan in what continues to be a solid macro environment for large well-capitalized company.","Our homebuilding operations and associated financial services business continue to form the core of our operating platform. Our results reflect the slow but steady growth in the overall homebuilding market. This year, summer season and the spring selling season before it confirm that the market is continuing to improve at a fairly consistent pace.","We continue to believe that the recovery in housing has been and will continue to be driven by strong and consistent demand. Employment is up. Labor is tight and wages are starting to rise. Millennials, who have been on the sidelines, are now starting to form households and are looking at housing alternatives. A growing number of individuals' balance sheets that were impaired by the economic downturn are starting to be repaired as the economy improves and as time passes and U.S. population continues to grow.","Even as demand grows, supply remains limited. We have often discussed the production deficit of both rental and for-sale homes relative to the needs for housing in the United States over the years since the downturn. This deficit has created a supply shortage as the growing pent-up demand comes to market. Without a dramatic increase in the number of homes built in this country, we will continue to be short dwelling unit for a growing population. Even though supply is limited as demand is building, we do not anticipate a surge in production. Frankly, I don't think that the current market conditions could support a strong increase in production. A combination of land, labor and mortgage availability are simply put limiting factors to a surge in production.","Limited capital for land and land development has left entitled lands in short supply while growing demands has driven up land prices. In most major U.S. market, the ability to grow quickly is limited by the available land, and the market's ability to bring new land to entitlement is limited by a constrained capital market for land developers. Homebuilders with strong land and capital position are able to carefully and methodically add some land position while less well positioned participant has seen margin and bottom line erode. Land continues to be the most challenging competitive environment in the homebuilders universe today.","Running a close second, labor has also become a limiting factor. The slow and steady recovery in housing did not signal to the labor market that it was time to come back to work in the sector, and many found work elsewhere. Today, the entire labor market has tightened and rapid growth in housing production will be limited by available labor. Larger builders with consistent production and payment plan are better able to maintain production but an overly rapid growth in production with significantly stressful labor force.","Finally, the regulatory environment for mortgages remains challenging and limits the number of entrants for the for-sale market. QM and QRM rules together with the ATR, that is the ability to repay rules, continue to restrict qualified purchasers from accessing the mortgage market. Adding to the complex landscape, [indiscernible] looms right around the corner as it complicates and slows the home closing process. While these rules have been evolving and easing at the margin, except for [indiscernible] of course which is just getting started, they have exacerbated an already impaired consumer psychology to create a perception that homeownership just might not be accessible. Even with that said, the pent-up demand is finding its way back to the market out of necessity.","All of this portends an extended recovery and duration with a slow and steady slope and with continued upward pressure on pricing. With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we feel that we are in an excellent environment to run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate with strong bottom-line profitability and strong cash flow. Our strategy at the bottom of the market was to purchase land aggressively.","As the recovery begins to take hold, we began a soft pivot towards a lighter land strategy and moderated growth. As the recovery has continued to mature, we have continued to adjust our operating strategy for current market conditions. We are using our strong land position to avoid chasing growth with low margin land deals.","We are fortifying our operations to focus to build products and environments that attract the best of the limited labor force. And we are refining all areas of selling and marketing and overhead to drive consistent high net operating margins. All of these strategic components can be seen in our results this morning. Overall, this is a very favorable environment for a well-capitalized national homebuilder.","We have believed and continue to believe that the down side in the housing market is very limited and the upside very significant. And of course, we believe that we are uniquely positioned within this market to continue to thrive. Of course, as we've continued to grow our core homebuilding business in the wake of the economic downturn, we also continue to grow and mature our additional business segments that represent significant opportunity to enhance shareholder value.","Our multifamily program continues to complement our for-sale operation. We've continued to expand our national footprint and grow from a merchant build program to a build-to-own program. As first time purchasers have begun coming back to the housing market more slowly than expected and more slowly than they have historically, we have addressed this market in a comprehensive way. While approximately 30% of our homebuilding business continues to be geared to first time home purchasers and that's up, by the way, from 25% last year. Our broader, new household strategy has been aimed primarily at the rental market.","Our $6 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well timed as rental rates are soaring and vacancies are at historical levels. This is driven by a supply-demand imbalance.","First-time households have had the most difficulty accessing the mortgage market. Credit limitations have been most constraining to the first-time buyers. And although that is beginning to open up as it has been reported, this segment is also the most susceptible to price and interest rate increases, and many have been and will continue to be relegated to the rental market, driving both rental rates and occupancies higher.","A new study by the Harvard Joint Center on Housing Studies and the enterprise community partners indicate that an increasing number of families are severely cost burdened by housing costs, indicating supply constraint in the rental markets. More rental product is needed, and we are well positioned to continue to fill this need and grow our multifamily platform.","As I noted before, our core financial services group has continued to expand alongside our primary housing business while we have also expanded our retail platform. Additionally, we've been able to capture an expanded share of the refi business as it exists.","Our Rialto Capital Asset Management platform enables us to invest across real estate and financial product types as an opportunistic play on the long duration recovery. The dysfunction in the financial market and the new risk retention rules work to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in CMBS and financial products.","And finally, our strategic investment in FivePoint and its management team positions us to continue to benefit from some of the best located land in California as that market continues to improve. As noted during the quarter, FivePoint has confidentially filed a registration statement for an initial public offering, and we will keep you posted as further information becomes available.","In conclusion, we are very pleased to present our third quarter results this morning, and we're confident that we have the right people, the right programs, and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future.","Now, let me turn over to Bruce.","Bruce Gross","Thank you, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the third quarter were $223 million, which is a 26% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 22% during the quarter, driven by a 16% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 5% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $350,000.","Our gross margin on home sales in Q3 was 24.1%, and we are still on track with our goal of 24% gross margins for the full year. The prior year's gross margin percentage for the third quarter was 25.2%. Sales incentives during this quarter continue to decline, and it was 5.6% versus 5.8% in the prior year's quarter.","Gross margin percentages were highest in the East, Southeast Florida, and West region this quarter. The gross margin decline year-over-year was also a result of increased land costs. Year-over-year direct construction costs are up approximately 5% to $52 per square foot. Labor increased over 10%, which drove almost all of the increase, while material costs have remained relatively flat year-over-year.","We have a continued focus on reducing costs due to commodity declines primarily in lumber, copper, oil, and steel. The total direct cost increases have moderated as we have continued throughout 2015. We remain on track with our previously stated guidance to achieve a 30-basis-point to 40-basis-point improvement in the combined selling, general and administrative cost and corporate G&A lines for the entire 2015. In this quarter, SG&A improved 50 basis points over the prior year. We continue to achieve improved SG&A operating leverage by growing organically in our existing divisions. And by the way, this is the lowest SG&A percentage of a Lennar third quarter going back to the late 1990s.","Equity and earnings from unconsolidated subs was $13.3 million during the quarter, compared to a $2.1 million loss in the prior year. This was primarily due to a gain on debt extinguishment and the sale of home sites to a third party in our El Toro joint venture. And this was partially offset by some operating expenses and other JVs.","This quarter, we opened 71 new communities to end the quarter with 673 net active communities. New homeowners, as you've seen in the release, were up a solid 10% for the quarter year-over-year, and new order dollar value increased 20% for the quarter.","Our sales pace declined to 3.2 sales per community per month in Q3 versus 3.3 in the prior year. However, after adjusting for some softness in the Houston market on the move upside, our absorption would be flat with the prior year. And the cancellation rate this quarter was consistent with the prior year at about 17%.","In the third quarter, we purchased 4,900 home sites, totaling $195 million versus spending $273 million in the prior year's quarter. The lower land spend represents the result of our soft pivot strategy that Stuart laid out.","Our home sites owned and controlled now totaled 170,000 home sites of which 132,000 are owned and 38,000 are controlled. Completed unsold inventory is in check, with approximately 1,100 homes which is in our normal range of one to two per community.","Turning to Financial Services, this business segment had strong results with operating earnings increasing to $39.4 million from $27.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income increased to $31.4 million from $20.6 million in the prior year. The increased mortgage earnings were due to higher volume, as mortgage originations increased 43% to $2.4 billion from $1.7 billion in the prior year.","Purchase origination volume increased 40% as a result of increased Lennar home deliveries and our expanded retail presence. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 82% this quarter from 77% in the prior year. Refinancings remained strong as refi origination volume increased by 74% versus the prior year. Our title company's profit increased to $8.2 million in the quarter from $7.1 million in the prior year, and this was primarily due to higher volume over the past year.","Turning to our Rialto segment. Rialto produced operating earnings of $9 million even compared to $12.4 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interests. The investment management business contributed $30.6 million of earnings, which includes $7.6 million of equity and earnings from real estate funds and $23 million of management fees and others.","At quarter end, the carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I, under a hypothetical liquidation, has increased and now stands at $112 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $519 million of commercial loans into three securitizations during the quarter, resulting in earnings of $14.2 million for the quarter, and that's the quarter G&A expenses.","Our liquidating direct investments had a loss of $1.9 million for the quarter, but we continue to monetize these investments and increase our cash flow. Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $26.9 million for the quarter, and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquid position with $107 million of cash.","And as an update of fundraising, we're now reaching the end of our investing cycle for Fund II, and we are now in the process of working on our first closing of commitments for Rialto Real Estate Fund III. This is expected to occur during the fourth quarter, and it's targeted to be greater than the amount in Fund II.","We continue to grow our multifamily operation, which has now grown to over 275 associates located in regional offices nationwide. We ended the quarter with three completed and operating projects, 28 projects under construction, of which 5 are in lease up, and over 7,700 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $1.9 billion. Included in these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $6 billion and over 20,000 apartments.","As expected, we had an operating loss in Q3. The $3 million operating loss related to G&A expenses that were partially offset my management fees and the $5.7 million share of a gain from the sale of one of our operating properties.","Turning to our tax rate, a decrease of 30% during the quarter. This is a lower tax rate in the first two quarters of the year, primarily due to a catch-up adjustment relating to validation of new home energy tax credits that were available to us.","Turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet liquidity remains strong as our home building cash balance ended the quarter at $596 million and there was $575 million borrowed under our $134 billion revolving credit facility at quarter end. Our leverage improved by 100 basis points year-over-year, as our net debt-to-total capital was reduced to 46.5%. We grew stockholders' equity by 17%, or $779 million over the prior year to $5.4 billion at quarter end. And our book value per share has now increased to $25.51.","During the quarter, we converted $169 million of our 2.75% convertible senior notes. Of this amount, $122 million was converted through privately negotiated transactions where we retired the par value of the notes in cash and issued 2.9 million shares when the average stock price was $47.34.","Turning to update goals for the rest of this year, let me start with deliveries, we are still on track with our delivery expectations for 2015 to between 24,000 and 24,500 homes. As a result, our backlog conversion ratio for Q4 should be between 90% and 95%.","Turning to gross margins, we still expect our gross margins in 2015 to average approximately 24% for the full year. Our fourth quarter gross margin percentage is expected to be just a touch above our third quarter actual 24.1%. SG&A and corporate G&A were still on track with the expectation of 30 to 40 basis points improvement for all of 2015 with all of the leverage coming from the SG&A line.","Financial Services, we are increasing our Financial Services earnings goal again for 2015. With the refi market driving higher volumes and stronger overall margins, we now expect to earn $120 million to $125 million for the full year. However, we continue to expect some cooling in the strong refi market as we finish out the year. Rialto is now expected to earn $25 million to $30 million for the full year. The recent market volatility that has been experienced has reduced the margin on securitization in our fourth quarter to the lower end of our normal range of 200 to 400 basis points in that business and the fees on the Rialto Real Estate Fund III will not have a significant contribution until 2016.","Turning to Multifamily, we expect to have one apartment community sale in the fourth quarter which will result in a profitable fourth quarter for our Multifamily segment. There are no joint ventures or other transactions expected in the fourth quarter and therefore it should be close to a breakeven bottom line for the company's homebuilding joint ventures in the fourth quarter. We're still on track with approximately $25 million of wholly-owned land sale profit for all of 2015. However, some of those transactions were successfully accelerated and shifted from the fourth quarter into our third quarter.","Our tax rate is expected to be about 34% for the fourth quarter. Our community count is still on track to hit a goal of 675 net communities by the end of the year. We remain well positioned to meet these goals as we finish our 2015.","And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mr. Stephen Kim from Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.","Stephen Kim","Hello. Can you hear me?","Stuart Miller","Yeah.","Stephen Kim","Okay. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could give us the land spend numbers. I believe you gave a figure that just included the purchases or acquisitions. I was wondering if you could give us a figure that included development as well. And then my second question relates to cash flow. Can you give us a sense for how cash flow figures in your list of priorities for the company over the next year or two?","Bruce Gross","Steve, let me take the first one and then I'll turn it over to Stuart. So the soft pivot strategy has also been noted in the land development line as well. In the third quarter of last year, we spent $307 million on land development, and this year's quarter, we've spent $286 million.","Stuart Miller","Okay. And to the second question on cash flow, Steve, cash flow has been a central focus of our strategy since we started talking about our soft pivot. We've highlighted to you into the Street that we came out of the downturn with a very, very strong focus on land acquisition at the bottom of the market. Rick and John crafted a strategy that really positioned the company very well. We began off of that a soft pivot towards a shorter duration at the beginning and at the end, shorter tails for the land.","And as the market has continued to mature and the competition for land assets has grown, we are very actively determined that we will not chase growth by pursuing tertiary location and low-margin land acquisition. And so we are focused on a combination of slower growth, more orderly growth, sustainable growth, and a focus on bottom-line cash flow and profitability.","Stephen Kim","Great. Thanks very much.","David Collins","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, maybe I just wanted to perhaps get a little bit of an expansion on your comments, Stuart, about not pursuing growth or stretching out beyond perhaps what was done in the last cycle.","When you think about the last cycle, I mean we have growth numbers that range low-double digits to up to 30% or more, depending, or nearly 30% in 2001. Do you have sort of I guess a minimum type of growth that you're thinking about? Of course, this would be more of a mid-cyclish question not at the peak or repositioning where there might be the next downturn. But as a low-double-digit type of a growth environment, what you're thinking in the back of your head when you talk about more moderate growth rate or how should we think about just the core business over the next few years.","Stuart Miller","So, one thing I don't want to do is start equating to the last cycle, because this recovery is very, very different in its composition. We highlighted that there are some interesting and somewhat unique limiting factors. I highlighted land. I highlighted labor and I highlighted mortgage availability. And while land had been constrained in prior cycles, the labor constraint today is a limiting factor that is somewhat different than we've seen in the past and mortgage availability is clearly a very different overlay in this cycle.","So, our view and our thinking has been to remain very focused on market conditions as they exist not try to drive our strategy with kind of a \u2013 just a reflection on past cycles but instead to adapt to the current market conditions. And we've concluded at an operating level that we're going to pursue land acquisition and growth strategy at levels that the market enables.","And each of the professionals in our respective markets across the country, are looking at land acquisition as opportunistic as a primary driver of future margins. And we're just not going to be holding to this simple growth game of hitting a growth metric.","So the answer to your question is, that we don't have a specific metric that we're solving to, but we are working within the confines of the existing market condition to strike the balance between orderly, consistent growth, and strong gross margins and especially strong bottom line and cash flow.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess the second question if I heard it right, the sales pace in the prepared remarks were I believe roughly down 2% year-over-year if you count, if you're comparing that against average community count. And I believe I heard that ex-Houston sales pace would have been more flattish year-over-year. I was hoping maybe to get a little more detail on what you're seeing in Houston market. Obviously, there's different commentary, there's been different commentary around different price points, different segments of the market. As well as perhaps to highlight some of your markets where you are seeing sales pace improved on a year-over-year basis.","Richard Beckwitt","Well, this is Rick, I'll talk about Houston. I would say that the Houston market is still overall a pretty decent market. Clearly with the decline in oil, the energy corridor there has been hit which is pretty much the far west side of the market.","Now, if you look at that, it hasn't been across all price points. The lower price points, let's say, sub-$300,000, $350,000 are performing pretty well. It's just when you get up in that $350,000-plus, the price point sales has been impacted and have slowed. Those would be the big master plan communities that are on the west side of town.","If you look in at Southwest, Northwest Houston, even at higher price points, those have slowed but they're still performing well. So it's price sensitive, geographically focused, but Houston is not one market, it's multiple markets. John, why don't you talk about some of the other [indiscernible].","Jonathan Jaffe","If you look at our different markets, California has seen the most acceleration and our sales pace, as well as growth in ASP. So, today [indiscernible] third quarter, California is representing up to 22% of our total revenues, it's up from 19% last year. With an average sales price of $507,000. Pacific Northwest is also seeing an acceleration in sales pace, as have parts of Florida seeing an acceleration. If you look at the rest of our markets, they are pretty much right around flattish year-over-year.","Michael Rehaut","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Nishu Sood","Thanks. I had a question for Stuart. Just your thoughts on the labor market. We're still pretty far below what most people would consider a normalized pace of housing construction. And whatever, obviously, unemployment has fallen, but the construction trades would seem to match up well with where there might be some relatively higher unemployment. So just looking for your thoughts on what do you think it's going to take for the labor market to ease poor construction. And how do you see that playing out as we get back to normalized in housing production?","Stuart Miller","Well, embedded in your question, I think, is exactly part of the problem. The slow and steady growth has not brought labor back to the housing market, and I think, overall, labor is constrained. So the ability of people to \u2013 we're not dealing with the same unemployment issue that we had at the beginning of the recovery, so there's not a large labor force to draw from.","It's an increasingly complicated landscape in that we have a shortfall in production that is really revealing itself. You see it most prominently in the rental market right now. Occupancies are very tight, rental rates are moving upward, and we've already seen an acceleration in multifamily production.","So the fact is that we're still under-producing normal rates of home production, and the labor market is already very, very tight across the country in all industries, but especially in the home market. So getting to a normalized production rate is going to be difficult, and it's why I say, I think that we have a slow and steady recovery. We're going to continue to attract labor back in.","We're going to continue to see unemployment go down, I think, and some pressure on wages, which has a double-edged sword of bringing our costs up but bringing more people to the market to purchase. And over time, with limited supply and growing demand, it seems that there's been a \u2013 during this steady increase in the recovery, we're going to continue to see some pressure on pricing \u2013 on prices, loan prices as well.","Nishu Sood","Great. I appreciate the thoughts. And the second question was on the multifamily side. With the significant pipeline you've built up, you previously talked about some profitability from the fourth quarter, and, Bruce, you mentioned that again. You've also talked about with the pipeline having been built up, that the fourth quarter might mark the beginning of more consistent profitability in multifamily. Is that still the expectation?","Richard Beckwitt","Yeah. This is Rick. I think as we move into \u2013 in our fourth quarter and into 2016, we should be getting more predictable profitability from the group. One of the things that \u2013 something that we can't control is since we've got these investments and partnerships, a lot of times we can't control the sale decision. It's got to be a joint decision, and as a result of that, it may move from one quarter to the other. But as we look at it on an annual basis, we should be profitable from here on out.","Nishu Sood","Okay. Thanks for the thoughts.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Dahl","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question, I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that first-time buyer mix is up to 30% from 25%, and I'm just curious if we could get a little more color, particularly as you've articulated kind of the challenges from an affordability standpoint, rising rents. So are you seeing a change in the type of product or square footage that your first-time buyers are opting for as you see that mix rise?","Stuart Miller","Let me let Rick and Jon kind of weigh in on this primarily, but I'll just say that we are \u2013 you might have listened to the opening remarks and heard that it is a constrained environment for first time buyers to come in. That remains the case and I meant to say it exactly that way. With that said, our first time buyer product offering and that across the homebuilding industry is increasing, it's mostly out of necessity. People are coming in and finding a way over time to access the mortgage market.","And it is altering the landscape somewhat as the first time market does start to come back in, but there's a very, very large pent-up demand both in rental and in for sale for buyers that need to come back in.","Jonathan Jaffe","This is Jonathan. In many of our markets, we are addressing this by increased density in our product offering of simple product in some cases attached, in some cases cluster or a higher density product that allows us to achieve a lower price point and make today's land environment work for us to address this first time buyer need.","Richard Beckwitt","Yeah. It really goes back to 18, 24 months ago when we first started getting questions about our product mix and how were we're going to attack the approach to first time buyer. We strategically gone after a well located easy access communities where people can get to traffic [indiscernible] and we've designed product accordingly that's smaller footprint, lower specification level, a little bit more cookie cutter product that's easier build and more towards the product.","Michael Dahl","Got it. Thank you. And second question is going back to some of the market commentary, and thank you for some of the color that you gave. I wanted to dig in on a couple other markets that, I think, were kind of lumped into the flattish category like Phoenix, Dallas and Austin. So, on Phoenix, I think some others have been reporting a decent bit of strength in that market. And then, on the flipside, I think Austin and Dallas had been quite strong and we maybe hearing of some pause in the market in those areas. So just wondering if you could offer some colors specifically on those three markets.","Jonathan Jaffe","This is Jon. I'll talk to Phoenix and let Rick handle the Texas markets. Phoenix is solidifying, seeing more strength over the earlier parts of the year. As you look at year-over-year, it's up just a little bit because the third quarter last year was decent and really saw a slowdown in the fourth, first quarters. Second was a little bit better and third is noticeably better as well. So, I wouldn't say it's strong again but it feels like it's a solid market today on an improving trend.","Richard Beckwitt","Yeah. I'm not sure we talked about the individual markets in Texas, about them being softer or flat. Quite contrary, Dallas performed extremely well, have seen sales price increases. But more particularly in that market, we're balancing pace and price because we secure some really trophy assets and want to make sure that we're maximizing the margins in these communities.","Austin for us is really just a transitional market from the standpoint of we're moving to recent communities and have a bunch of new communities that are about to open, so you'll see a little bit better performance in Austin. But outside of Easton, Texas markets are performing well. We're seeing big job growth, good wage increases across the board and the state has really positioned itself well to attract employment.","Jonathan Jaffe","This is Jon again. I'll just add that you just have to be careful as you talk about any submarket because even within submarkets, there are areas and product types that perform stronger than others, and it's very much a community-by-community analysis.","Michael Dahl","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is now open.","Ryan Tomasello","Hi. This is actually Ryan Tomasello on for Jade. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could provide your updated thoughts on consolidation in both the homebuilding market and in Rialto's various business lines, including CMBS special servicing, given that the role of the B-piece buyer in the CMBS market appears to be increasing in importance.","Stuart Miller","Hello? Seems that we got cut off, but, Rick, why don't you take M&A and homebuilding?","Richard Beckwitt","Yeah. On the acquisition side within the homebuilding space, we continue to see some private companies, some larger regional companies that are available for purchase. We're being very careful because, as Stuart said, we're very focused on the underlying asset values and want to make sure that if we're going to purchase something, if it's not taking us into a new geographic area, that we're purchasing something that's going to produce decent margins.","We're fortunately very diversified as a company today, so there's very few geographic areas that would be new markets for us. So as a result of that, given the fact that we've got very strong land acquisition folks spread out across the country, the deal would have to pencil out for us to look at it.","On the Rialto side...","Stuart Miller","Yes. Look, on the Rialto side, Jeff, why don't you weigh in?","Jeffrey Krasnoff","Yeah. I was going to say, as it relates \u2013 it sounded like the question was headed in the direction of special services [indiscernible] and special services really are sort of the gatekeepers for those transactions both upfront in terms of the timing and the collateral that goes into the transactions and after the fact in terms of overseeing the loans to ensure that they get collected. It's a relatively small group today. There aren't that many. I think if you look at the top four or five, it's probably 80% of the marketplace, but behind the time, there are opportunities out there. And when there are, we will take a look and the comments are pretty much the same as what Rick said, if the numbers make sense.","Stuart Miller","Yeah. So adding to that is the question my opinion of what risk retention does to the landscape because special servicing combined with B-piece purchasing as a significant part of enabling a [ph] risk (44:16) retention environment. The amount of capital required for that business is going to get bigger.","I don't know that M&A is the direction or not the direction that we go, but it opens up a band of opportunity. And frankly, it's the five that's going to have to be absorbed. So, there's tremendous amount of business in that arena that is \u2013 that's going to divide \u2013 that's going to define the next wave of activity. We're very well positioned for it.","Ryan Tomasello","Great. Thanks for taking that question. And this is a follow up, you previously noted that you have a single family rental community. I was wondering if you can provide an update on whether or not you're seeing any indications if that makes you more positive or negative towards that sector.","Stuart Miller","We are decidedly more positive relative to that sector, specifically the way that we are doing it, which is a kind of unified community of single-family homes. We think that single-family product is desirable, We think that the leverage, the management leverage associated with a community approach to single family is very attractive and provides management efficiencies. The single family scattered approach I think still has some elements of shortcoming, although the product is very desirable.","And we expect to expand on that platform as we go forward, there are still some complications in terms of the financing of those kinds of communities. And really defining what the rental rates are for those communities. But our first experimentation is proving to be very successful. I would add parenthetically, that expanding that platform comes with all of the challenges of accessing the labor market and actually getting the homes built.","So we're still in the experimentation phase. We think it's a really unique opportunity that rides right between our for-sale single-family operations and our multifamily rental operations. And we're uniquely qualified to be moving in this direction.","Ryan Tomasello","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you, the next question is coming from Mr. Ryan McKeveny from Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.","Ryan McKeveny","Thank you, and nice quarter. Given the continued upside in terms of profitability in the financial services segment. Can you just elaborate on your expansion of your retail presence? And you do see any low-hanging fruit to continue taking share in that retail purchase business to essentially drive profits even if we do see things slow on the refinance side?","Bruce Gross","Yeah, this is Bruce. We continue to look for the right fit within our program. So there are opportunities to look at, some bolt-on acquisitions like we did last year with the Pinnacle deal. That's worked out very well. It's been integrated extremely well. And if we could find other opportunities like that, we'd be very interested.","One thing to highlight is that when the refinance market is hot, the margins that we earn on both the purchase and the refi business is above normal type of margin. So we do expect that as refis maybe taper down a little bit, as we go through the latter part of this year, there might be a little bit of margin compression as well.","But, again, our folks are looking at continuing to expand the retail presence. We don't have a full national footprint yet, but we're growing it. But we're going to make sure we do it with the right types of programs and the right people.","Ryan McKeveny","Great. Thank you. And then also on the topic of mortgages, just any update on where you think you as well as the industry stand in terms of TRID implementation, and any anticipated delays on deliveries within that guidance that you gave for the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Bruce Gross","So, October 3rd is the date that TRID is implemented for new applications, and our team has been very focused with the software vendors and with training to make sure it goes as smooth as possible. We think we're in good shape because we're fortunate to have our homebuilding team, our mortgage associates, and our title associates, and our IT associates all working together.","We don't control what happens outside of our mortgage company, which is about 20% of the business, but we are as well positioned as we could be. Keep in mind, often when you have some deliveries you might pick up at the very end of the quarter or year, that makes it tougher because of the three-day waiting period if any changes are made. But we're as well-positioned as we could possibly be at this point.","Look, TRID is a combination of waiting period and process. And we've been training and operating under a TRID-like environment. So we expect that our operations are going to be well-positioned to handle volume and to have a good smooth year-end closing.","Ryan McKeveny","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen East from ISI Group. Your line is now open.","Stephen East","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Both in your prepared comments, Stuart, in the press release, you talked about land and land inflation, a few things around that. Could you talk about how long do you think it would be for the industry before we get to the sufficient finished lot supply on the ground more broadly speaking. I know every market varies, but is this a one year, two years, three years type thing. And then could you talk about on the land inflation side, how much is it up year-over-year? You talked about labor being up 10%. How much do you think land is and sort of rank order of the regions of the most inflation?","Stuart Miller","So, look, I think that the land market is constrained in lot of levels, not the least of which is the capital constraint. The traditional lending avenues have remained close to the land asset as a basis for opening doors to lending. And so as production is really being forced to expand to normalize, land is behind the eight ball, and the enabling factor \u2013 that is, the access to capital \u2013 is continuing to constrain the ability to entitle new property.","So I think this is a long-term deficit that we're going to see limiting the ability to expand production and to \u2013 or to even normalize production, and we think that keeps pressure on home prices to go up and land prices as well.","I think that what we've seen is probably a 14% kind of inflation factor for land on an annual basis right now. I don't know, looking ahead, what the right number is in terms of land prices going up, but we're uniquely positioned with a really strong land position to leverage off of. We're able to be more deliberate, careful in our approach to purchasing the next parcel.","And as long as we don't try to accelerate growth but instead remain steady, I think that we're really advantaged in our ability to navigate this market. But with that said, in most land markets, you're seeing land prices accelerate because of that scarcity and limited access to capital. And maybe Rick and Jon would like to weigh in on specific region.","Richard Beckwitt","As you would expect, Stephen, is you'll see more acceleration. For example, in Coastal California, some Coastal Florida, you see less acceleration in the center part of the country. Just as you would normally expect and you can follow sales price trends to sort of look forward to see what happened to land markets there.","Jonathan Jaffe","Yeah. The Texas market, you're not going to see as much because land comes on faster and there are some larger developers there. But all this context, Steve, I can go back to what Stuart said at the beginning is while pricing is going up across the board for most of the people out there. We're not really facing as much of a headwind. It gives us the opportunity to be more selective, more opportunistic because we were very aggressive going back to 2009.","Stephen East","Okay. And that is a great answer. I appreciate all of that. And then just sort of a little bit of a hodgepodge here. Bruce, you talked about refi on the financial services. Could you give us an idea right now what percentage of volume and profits, refi would be versus purchase? And then on the pricing, your house price are about 5%. How much of that is mixed versus true pricing power would you say?","Bruce Gross","Let me take the question on the refi season. So, as you look at actual originations, originations were only 11% of total originations this quarter even though it was up 74% over the last year. But when we look at profitability, we have a high refinance market who end up earning better margins than you would in a normalized market because the purchase business is fighting for more deals. And everybody's busy and has enough activity, you tend to end up with better margins. So the true profitability from refi is a little bit hard to calculate because we're typically \u2013 we would typically make somewhere between $2,000 and $3,000 per lot loan. This quarter, we were over $3,300. So we would expect to be back and maybe at $2,500 to $3,000 range as the refinance market cools off a bit.","Stephen East","Okay. That's helpful. And then on house prices, just to understand, because you had mentioned that \u2013 we offset some of the land cost with pricing. So I'm just trying to get a feel for how much is mix and how much is true pricing power?","Stuart Miller","I would say that given the fact that our first time buyer profile is moving up, that's more towards the lower end. It makes us probably been more of a moderating factor. And I think that would be a proxy for the housing market at large. I think you probably \u2013 when you start to see \u2013 I think in today's existing home sales numbers, we saw a reduction in the median home price. But I think that what you're seeing is a little bit more mixed towards the lower end.","And I think that's reflective of the fact that at the higher end, the more desirable areas, there's just very limited supply. And so you're not actually seeing a decrease in demand that the higher end, it's just a decrease in the number of actual deliveries. And this got a higher percentage of lower price and that's bringing the medium price down. I think that's more of the case in our numbers as well.","Bruce, would you agree with that?","Bruce Gross","Yes. No. I think you're spot-on.","Stephen East","All right. Thank you all.","Stuart Miller","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Mr. Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is now open.","Eric Bosshard","Thank you. In terms of gross margin, you did a good job walking through the moving pieces within that. I'm curious as you think about the land relative to selling price and what you see going on with labor costs, if you have any thoughts for us on how we should think about how this works moving forward just beyond the current year. I'm not necessarily asking specifically for guidance, of course, but how you think about those moving pieces as we work through the cycle.","Stuart Miller","Given that the market continues the slow and steady recovery, I think we see more of the same with generally the ability on like products be able to increase prices as there isn't enough supply to match demand and to offset those labor costs and land costs. And as was stated, as we \u2013 see our mix trend to more of our lower priced product, that will have an overall effect of bringing down our ASP, not necessarily our margin, though.","Eric Bosshard","Great. And then secondly, in the same construct, as you think about the ability to lever SG&A in the homebuilding operation, is there anything that changes with your ability to improve efficiency as it influences how that performs going forward?","Stuart Miller","I think we continue to find leverage particularly on the sales component of that as we focus on our online strategy and look to reduce costs there. And then with our \u2013 as Rick said, we're well positioned across the country, in the markets that we're in. So as we continue to add community count, I think we'll continue to see some G&A leverage there as well.","Bruce Gross","And I would just add to your first question there, we did have a higher percentage of deliveries coming from California this quarter where you have an average sales price. So our land costs also increased as well because, in California, the percentage of the home price relating to land is a little higher. So that 14% is a little bit more weighted higher this quarter because of the product mix.","Eric Bosshard","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee CRT. Your line is now open.","Jay McCanless","Good morning, everyone. First question I had on the spec count, you guys talked about 1,100 I believe this quarter. What percentage of your deliveries came from spec and where do you \u2013 what do you anticipate that will go? And especially as you broaden out in the more entry level, do you think you're going to be relying more heavily on spec product?","Stuart Miller","Well, on the spec for the entry level, we're pretty much build to order and most of our first-time buyer markets, we, as in any community, need some product there for immediate delivery homes. But our spec strategy doesn't really vary by that price point.","Jonathan Jaffe","This is Jon. If you look at it, we've consistently run at a spec level about one to two per community depending on the time of the year and we track pretty well with that. So we don't see any increase or decrease in the way we're operating our day-to-day business.","Jay McCanless","Okay. Perfect. Thanks. The second question I have on the apartment business, could you remind us how many of \u2013 I think it's 28 total between construction and completed. How many of those are wholly-owned by Lennar and how many of those are owned by JVs?","Stuart Miller","All of these 28 are owned by JVs.","Jay McCanless","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Stuart Miller","And this will be our last question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Buck Horne","Hey. Thanks very much. Going back to labor real quickly, I was wondering if you look at the \u2013 as you're thinking ahead of 2016 and the tightness of the labor markets. I think consensus out there is expecting your total deliveries to be up around 10% year-over-year in 2016. But is there any growing risk that the labor shortages that you're seeing or the tightness could create backlog cycle time issues and maybe push out some deliveries?","Stuart Miller","Well, as I noted in the remarks, the larger builders have been singularly advantaged in the current environment. It's a combination of \u2013 and especially in our Everything's included, being able to simplify our product offering is a big advantage for us. But additionally payment schedules, subs are looking for consistent workload with dependable payment schedules, and they have the ability to do a little bit of picking and choosing, and they're definitely aligning with larger, better capitalized builders.","As we've navigated the shortage of labor, we have found that we're able to consistently run our operations and deliver without too much of a hiccup. Can that change over time? It certainly can, and there's no way to predict the future. But we're not anticipating that at this point. We feel very comfortable that we're able to leverage our position and keep production machines going at pace.","Buck Horne","My last one is just more of a policy-type question because we are entering that season of the political cycle and immigration policy has been a significant hot-button issue already. But do you have any concerns or industry view if we continue to see a tightening of immigration policy become an even bigger political movement? Is that something that could affect the homebuilding industry into 2016?","Stuart Miller","I think about this a lot. I think that you listen to some of the political rhetoric and you \u2013 sometimes you just want to go hide under your sheets and not come out, but I think practically speaking, the practical landscape is going to moderate. If you listen to some of the discussion this weekend, it sounds like we're gearing up to accept the whole new group of immigrants from the Middle East. And so there are a lot of offsets and questions embedded in all of this.","I think labor shortage and the way that the country has been wired historically \u2013 common sense kind of tells me that this is going to even out and we're going to see kind of an orderly approach to immigration. And it won't be a singular kind of negative impact. But you go to extremes and you start to say we're going to support 11 million people, then we have to start to think about that. We'll have to see how it plays out, but I think that common sense says it finds equilibrium and we're going to be okay.","Buck Horne","Okay. I appreciate your insights. Thank you very much.","Stuart Miller","Okay. Very good. And listen, I want to thank everybody for joining us and look forward to reporting year-end at the end of our fourth quarter. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart A. Miller","Great. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Thank you, David. Thanks, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter 2012 update. We're pleased to detail our results for you this morning. As always, I'm joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Dave Collins, our Controller. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of our Rialto segment, are here to participate as well. Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, will join us by conference line from California and also will participate.","I'm going to begin this morning with some brief opening remarks about the housing market in general and about our first quarter results. Rick and Jon will comment on specific aspects of Lennar's Homebuilding operations and Jeff will update performance in our Rialto segment and Bruce will conclude and add specifics with the financial review.","Simply put, the housing market is recovering. Not only are sales, margins and backlogs improving, but the beginnings of a sense of visibility are coming back to underwriting land acquisitions and planning for the future. The Homebuilding business is beginning to revert to normal and that's positive for the U.S. economy in general, which is, in turn, good for a sustained recovery in the housing market.","Last quarter, I noted various trends that were driving stabilization and recovery in housing. Those trends have continued to define the path to recovery. Briefly, those drivers are: one, home price value and interest rates driving affordability; two, for-sale monthly payments compare favorably to rentals; three, inventories of distressed homes and foreclosures are declining; four, consumer confidence is improving and consumers don't want to miss current prices and interest rates; and five, the mortgage approval process is stabilizing and getting marginally better. In fact, on this last trend, we see with QE3 that the government is focused on the home mortgage market and is working to keep rates low and to maintain an orderly flow of capital to the mortgage market. To me, at least, this is an important harbinger of future focus on nurturing a housing recovery.","Overall, demand has been improving and we've seen consistent sales pace at improving prices; that is, prices that are reverting from overcorrected lows to normal throughout our third quarter. Our steady traffic and sales pace indicates stronger demand trends as we have seen a material increase in our monthly sales per community from about 1.5 to 2 per month to this quarter at 3.2 sales per community per month. These improved results come with gross margins that are consistent with our current deliveries, indicating that we are not and have not been reaching for volume. While I'm increasingly enthusiastic about the housing recovery, I don't want to overstate the case. While the trend is decidedly positive, stabilization and recovery are still uneven across the country and even within markets. As I've said before, the housing depression was a national phenomenon while the recovery is very local. We're continuing to see pockets of activity develop across the country that are recovering and these pockets are growing, while still the broader market outside of these pockets often remains weak.","Additionally, demand trends continue to be constrained by mortgage qualification standards and processes that define today's mortgage market and remains overcorrected by the severity of the downturn. But demand is growing and more and more consumers continue to look for some loosening of credit standards. With the market improving and driven by sound fundamentals, it's beginning to be interesting to be a homebuilder again. Let me turn briefly to Lennar specifically as our management team will give additional color on our results.","In our third quarter, we saw continued improvement in all of the building blocks that define our Homebuilding and Financial Services operations, while Rialto enhanced and expanded its blue chip operating platform. Each of our operating segments remained profitable in the third quarter as our associates across the country are really executing on all fronts.","On the Homebuilding front, each element of our business has continued to improve. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, closings were up 28% versus 20% last quarter. New orders increased 44% versus 40% last quarter. Our backlog improved 79% versus 61% last quarter and gross margins of 23.2% versus 22.5% last quarter translated into our healthy operating margin of 11.2% versus 9.2% last quarter as SG&A declined to 12% versus 13.2% last quarter.","We are clearly seeing the impact of operating leverage that we expected as the market has stabilized and as sales per community have increased. As we look ahead to future quarters, improved sales per community, together with increased community count, will be the engine that drives the SG&A operating leverage that will produce strong and sustainable bottom line earnings even as construction costs do trend upward.","Our overall strategy of focusing on high margins in well-positioned communities has clearly paid off. Lennar's Homebuilding operations are operating soundly and are defined by excellent hands-on management running the day-to-day activities while excellent new communities are identified and added to each division.","Lennar Financial Services had another excellent quarter as well with operating earnings of $25.3 million. Lennar Financial Services has continued to expand alongside of the core Homebuilding business, providing excellent service to our customers and leveraging increased volume. Additionally, we've opportunistically added incremental volume by participating in the refinance market.","Rialto continued to play a central part in the improving Lennar story. Rialto contributed $7.7 million of operating earnings, while the Rialto connections and relationships have continued to help grow and expand our core Homebuilding business. The synergy between our Rialto segment and our Homebuilding segment continues to exceed every expectation that we had when we began to grow this business. Rialto results include the wind-down of our PPIP program that Jeff will discuss in just a few minutes. But perhaps most noteworthy is the fact that capital invested in the start-up of Rialto is beginning to cycle back to Lennar and will enable us to aggressively grow our homebuilding platform while Rialto continues to invest third-party capital.","The Rialto franchise will continue to be a significant source of valuable homebuilding deals for some time to come, while the base Rialto business continues to ramp its earnings. As we look ahead, Rialto should continue to be a solid earnings contributor for Lennar and will continue to return cash to corporate.","All in all, our third quarter 2012 results mark an excellent stepping stone to strong future performance. We are feeling more and more comfortable that the current trend is, in fact, the beginning of a new cycle for housing. As I look ahead to the remainder of this year, and towards 2013, I'm increasingly optimistic that we are seeing a real recovery in housing and that we will continue to see improvement. With national new home deliveries in 2012 expected in the 450,000 to 500,000 range, there's a lot of opportunity for expansion as the market normalizes over the next years to a normalized million home plus.","Additionally, with smaller builders temporarily hamstrung by constrained capital markets, larger, well-capitalized builders like Lennar have a head start and can expect market share gains. Assuming this market recovery is not derailed, expanding deliveries and fewer participants should provide us with some excellent opportunities.","Lennar's positioned with a strong balance sheet in the right markets with an exceptional management team and a well-constructed strategy to perform solidly as market conditions continue to improve. All of the segments of our company are performing well and are extremely well positioned, as you will now hear from our operating team. Let me turn over to Jon now.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Good morning. As Stuart noted, we saw continued improvement in our third quarter results with a post impairment 23.2% gross margin and an 11.2% net operating margin. This bottom line profitability was driven by our focus on pricing strategies, product offerings, direct cost management and by leveraging our operating structure. We continued to see a normalized sales pace in the third quarter, with a rate of 3.2 sales per community per month as compared to last year with a 2.2 sales per month rate. This level of activity produced 4,198 new orders and has positioned us with a backlog of 4,513 homes, respectively, 44% and 79% year-over-year improvement.","In the context of these improving market conditions, many investors' questions have turned to the cost side of the equation. Let me give you some color as to what we see going on in the field. In the third quarter, we saw cost increases in all of our markets. The level of these increases range from $2,000 to $3,000 per home and an average total of about $2,400 per home or just over $1 per square foot. This equates to about 10 basis points of our average sales price. Many of these increases are not yet reflected in our closings as the timing of the effective date on each contract will vary. Cost increases range by product type and from region to region, depending upon the local supply-demand balances.","The material categories that have increased the most over the last year are lumber, drywall and concrete. Together, these categories are up year-over-year, about $0.75 per square foot. In some markets, labor constraints are also contributing to the increasing costs. This is most commonly seen in framing and drywall labor. As an offset, we continue to implement cost reductions with the systems and controls we put in place during the downturn. Through a nationally driven purchasing process, we've achieved savings that reduce the impact of these cost increases. Through our process for analyzing field construction variances, we have reduced material quantities used in our homes, saving about $0.18 per square foot year-over-year. Another example of this is our value engineering review on hardware and beams that has saved us about $0.22 per square foot.","Cycle time is another topic where we received questions from investors. While to date, our average cycle time has remained level, there are areas with shortages of labor supply that could drive cycle time a little higher. Markets like Phoenix, parts of Florida and Texas have labor shortages in some trades while other markets like the Inland Empire, Dallas and Charlotte have labor pools that have been able to absorb the increase in activity. Again, we believe that our strong management team will mitigate most of the impact of these labor shortages.","While construction costs are trending up as the market normalizes, we're finding the opportunity to improve our sales prices. Sales pricing appears to be reverting back to normal market conditions. Prices had overcorrected during the downturn, dropping by as much as 25% to 30%. So the 4% year-over-year improvement in our average sales price represents the continuation of an adjustment, not back to peak conditions, but to a more normal market condition.","The opportunity to improve prices comes from a combination of reducing incentives and raising prices. Our average incentives for the third quarter were down to 9.2%, a 280-basis point improvement. Our average sales price was $258,000, an improvement of $11,000 over last year. We expect as pricing returns to normal, we will be able to cover cost increases and deliver the high level of gross margin we achieved in the third quarter as we move forward.","With our increased volume, we continue to leverage our operating structure. With deliveries up 28% year-over-year, our SG&A dropped to 12% of revenues, a 230-basis point improvement. Again, the disciplines put in place during the downturn help us manage our overhead as conditions improve. An example of this is our advertising spend where we reduced our total advertising cost by 25% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. This drop represents 70 basis points of the 230-basis point reduction in SG&A. As market conditions improved, we were quick to address our advertising and other selling costs that were no longer necessary.","As we look forward, we believe our management team and the systems and controls we have in place and the reengineering of our company during the downturn will work to provide industry-leading operating margins. Thank you, and I'd now like to turn it over to Rick.","Richard Beckwitt","Thanks, Jon. We're really pleased with the operating results we had this quarter. These results were driven by both a well-executed land acquisition strategy and a fine-tuned homebuilding machine.","As in prior quarters, I'm going to review our land activities and explain why Lennar is positioned to succeed in today's recovering market. During the quarter, we continued to focus on acquiring or auctioning new homesites that would have a positive impact on our bottom line. This quarter, we purchased approximately 8,300 homesites for $339 million, and we spent about $81 million on land development. Combined, our land acquisition and land development spend was up about 67% over the prior year period.","In addition, we signed contracts to acquire approximately 8,000 homesites. From a geographic standpoint, approximately 55% of our land spend in the third quarter was located in the West, 14% in Florida, 13% in Texas, 7% in the mid-Atlantic, with the remaining 11% spread throughout our other markets. The lion's share of our new land deals were sourced outside of the competitive bid environment and were relationship-based deals. As in prior quarters, money was invested geographically in the markets we saw the best opportunities. In Q3, we invested heavily in the West, particularly in California. We also continue to invest in some unique high-margin opportunities in Florida and Texas, 2 of our strongest markets. You will continue to see quarter-to-quarter changes in the geographic mix of our land purchases as we capitalize on the best opportunities out there.","While the land market has heated up, we found no shortage of great opportunities. Strategically, we are still pursuing finished homesite deals, which, in today's market, provide a higher return on investment in exchange for a somewhat lower gross margin. The risk reward associated with these deals is still very compelling, especially given the operating leverage we have today in our company. These deals can be brought online very quickly without any significant overhead, and the profits fall right to the bottom line. However, the better-located finished homesite deals are getting harder to find because the land development and entitlement business shut down in the depths of the market decline. Nonetheless, the deep-rooted relationships we formed with land sellers during the market turmoil positions us extremely well in locking up what is available.","Recognizing this inevitable shortage, for the past several years, we have been aggressively tying up high-margin, low-cost deals where Lennar will develop the land internally. Under the radar, while many of the other builders were focused solely on purchasing finished homesites, we have amassed some incredible properties across the country in A-plus locations where finished homesites are running scarce. We started by acquiring large-scale busted development deals where much of the infrastructure was already in the ground. In these deals, the development costs are relatively modest and finished homesites can be brought on and produced relatively quickly. We then moved to early-stage raw land opportunities that required adjustments in zoning and other entitlements in order to work in today's market. Many of these were infill locations. In these deals, we tied up the property and invested our intellectual capital by working with land sellers, towns and municipalities to create win-win programs. In each case, these deals provide us with low-cost finished homesites in class A locations where there will be very little new for-sale housing close by. The good news is that many of these deals are coming online now and will continue to do so throughout 2013.","At August 31, 2012, we owned and controlled approximately 124,000 homesites and had 444 active communities. We should end the fiscal year with about 480 active communities, many of which will be coming online late in the fourth quarter. Our community count by the end of 2013 should grow by approximately 15% based on the deals we have in hand today. We also expect that about 25% of these new communities will be legacy and mothballed communities where we already own the land and have waited for market values to recover. We're excited to bring these inactive communities to the market.","As we move into 2013, while our focus to date has been on maintaining community count and increasing absorptions per community, our focus today has shifted to increasing both community count and absorptions. We are operating very efficiently today, and with the added fuel from our newer land deals, our operating leverage will be substantial. We have been relentless in our pursuit of new opportunities and I'd like to thank our people for their hard work and dedication. Simply put, they are in a league of their own.","Before I turn it over to Jeff, let me give you some final stats. On a year-over-year basis, our inventory at the end of the third quarter increased by about $845 million to approximately $4.7 billion, and this excludes consolidated inventory not owned. Sequentially, during the third quarter, our inventory increased about $276 million from the second quarter. During the third quarter, approximately 51% of our deliveries came from communities purchased to put under contract during the last 3 years. Our gross margin on the closings from these new communities has continued to exceed the company average by about 200 basis points.","I'd like to turn it to Jeff.","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. During the current quarter, Rialto contributed $7.7 million of earnings to the company. While Bruce will walk you through in more detail the components of our contribution, the bulk of our earnings are from our growing investment management business, where we invest both our capital and that of third parties in funds and other vehicles. We participate in our share of the income from our investments in these vehicles, as well as the fees and carried interest we receive related to managing those investments. As an example, this quarter, we effectively wrapped up the bulk of our first vehicle, our public-private investment fund in partnership with the U.S. Department of Treasury. During the 2.5-year life of our $4.6 billion PPIP fund, we had, on average, $61 million of our equity outstanding as an investor in the fund that we helped to manage. Effective today, we've now recycled back in cash from interest income, capital gains, fees and carried interest almost $110 million, while generating a 25% internal rate of return. In addition, now that this very successful program is wrapped up with almost $16 million of earnings this quarter, the volatility associated with mark-to-market accounting has been eliminated.","Similarly, our Rialto Real Estate Fund with $700 million of private equity commitments, including $75 million from us, had another strong quarter, contributing $10.6 million from our share of the funds' underlying earnings, plus our fees and reimbursements. All of our distressed debt investments since the fund's first closing in late 2010 have been made through this vehicle. We've now called all of the fund's original equity commitments to acquire in 44 separate transactions about $2 billion of assets based on unpaid principal balance and for less than $0.40 on the dollar. So far, we've done extremely well, exceeding our original underwriting and taking in over $275 million from asset resolutions, interest and property income, principal paydowns and financings. These cash collections have allowed us to recycle equity into new fund investments beyond the original $700 million of commitments even as we work on raising and closing our next real estate fund.","At the end of June, the net asset value for the fund represented over a 27% net internal rate of return for our investors. In addition, if we continue on this path on performance, we would expect to exceed the return hurdles set for our investors, which means that over time, carried interest would enure to Rialto who is the manager of the fund. None of that potential value is represented in our earnings today.","Our pipeline of new investments also continues to be strong as the relationships we have built with sellers have put us in an advantageous position. These relationships have also led to perhaps the most significant and unexpected contribution that Rialto has added to the Lennar enterprise. As Stuart and Rick have already indicated, the invaluable access to lenders and distressed borrowers has helped to drive our primary Homebuilding business. Together, we've been able to add thousands of advantageously priced homesites across dozens of new Lennar communities in multiple markets and with more in the pipeline.","Our early on balance sheet investments, however, continue to lag as the sluggish environment has slowed revenues. In addition, broad government oversight involvement has increased our cost to levels we had not anticipated. We're finding that a number of borrowers and guarantors in our earlier deals, emboldened by the long delays available in the judicial system and sympathetic legislatures, have been taking obstinate positions about repaying their personally guaranteed loans or electing not to perform after agreeing with us on restructured loan terms. The related higher costs involved, including those from owning and managing over $2 billion by principal balance of foreclosed properties, must be expensed upfront while revenue recognition is delayed until resolutions or sales occur in future periods. This extended timing and anticipated reduction in net collections, primarily in our FDIC portfolios, was reflected in the top to bottom review we just completed and is what drove the impairments we recognized this quarter and which Bruce will also cover in more detail.","It's worth noting we're not seeing anything similar with our later investments as we have recalibrated our newer purchases to this environment and focused our efforts on buying directly from banks and purposely selected loans secured by vertical collateral, often with in-place operating cash flow as compared with a significant land component in our earlier transactions. Nonetheless, we remain very focused on these balance sheet investments to create long-term value and bring cash back to the company to be recycled. Overall, we've already collected over $700 million of cash in these investments to date.","The biggest component of that relates to the FDIC transactions where we have approximately $211 million left in net collections in order to fully repay the original $627 million of seller financing, after which we begin receiving cash distributions. As we look forward, without the volatility from our PPIP investment, our future fund investment business should not only help to enhance the company's returns and add more consistent cash flow and earnings, but also be an important building block for us to create a valuable investment management platform. Our ability to add new sources of business on our already existing management base of over 200 professionals, our current position in the market place and the synergies with the rest of Lennar operations, we expect in due course, will be reflected in growing value for our shareholders. We're excited about the future and look forward to reporting to you on our progress. Thank you. Bruce?","Bruce E. Gross","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll provide a little more color to the results, starting with Homebuilding. The company's average sales price, that increased 4% year-over-year to $258,000. I'd like to give a breakdown by region. The East region was $245,000, up 11%; Southeast Florida was $278,000, up 1%; Central, $225,000, up 1%; Houston, $236,000, up 3%; West Region, $299,000, down 1%; Other, $358,000, down 5%.","Jon and Rick already highlighted the drivers of our strong gross margin performance and significant operating leverage during the quarter, so I'm going to turn to the Financial Services segment.","We had a good quarter in Financial Services, generating operating earnings of $25.3 million versus $8 million last year. The third quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year for the Financial Services segment and it was helped further this year with the strong refinance environment leading to higher volumes and strong operating leverage. Mortgage pretax income increased to $22.3 million from $7.4 million in the prior year. This quarter's mortgage originations increased by 72% to $1.3 billion. Our in-house mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 75% this quarter. Originations with non-Lennar homebuyers increased 116% this quarter, primarily due to an increase in the number of refinance transactions.","Our title company had a $3.6 million profit in Q3 and that compared with $1.3 million in the prior year. This was driven by a 35% increase in revenues. Our Rialto business segment that Jeff talked about, generated operating earnings of $7.7 million, and again, this number is net of $13.4 million of net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest. As you remember, we have to consolidate the FDIC transaction, and this compares to $5.7 million in the prior year.","Let me go through the composition of Rialto's $7.7 million of operating earnings by type of investment. Our PPIP investment contributed $16 million of earnings, and this includes profits from interest income, sale of securities and management promote fees. Our first Rialto Real Estate Fund contributed $6.2 million of earnings this quarter. The FDIC transactions had a $7.8 million loss during the quarter. The non-FDIC portfolios had $0.5 million loss and these amounts were reduced by approximately $6.2 million of general and administrative expenses and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $6.7 million.","The $7.8 million FDIC loss was due to impairments during the quarter. Each quarter, we review all the cash flows in the FDIC deal, and due to some changes in timing and reduction in cash flows, we recorded $20 million of impairments in the FDIC portfolios with our share totaling approximately $8 million. Rialto continues to generate strong cash flow. At quarter end, the FDIC debt, net of cash available in the defeasance account and in Rialto's cash account, was $211 million.","As Stuart highlighted, we have been focusing on recycling capital invested in Rialto back to Lennar. And in the third quarter, we returned approximately $70 million from the PPIP and this now reduces Lennar's total investment in Rialto to approximately $530 million.","Turning to taxes. This quarter, we reversed $44 million of the remaining $177 million deferred tax asset reserve, and we continue to believe most of the remainder will reverse by the end of 2013. We expect there will be enough reversal of the DTA reserves in Q4 to offset any tax expense.","Our balance sheet liquidity improved in the third quarter with $692 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings under our $525 million 3-year unsecured revolving credit facility. The committed portion of the facility has been increased to $500 million subsequent to quarter end. We continued our balance sheet strategy of pushing out debt maturities while reducing our cost of capital as we raised $400 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2017 and simultaneously tendered for $205 million of 5.95% notes due 2013. We took a charge of $6.5 million relating to the successful tender in the coming quarter.","Let me turn it open for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Michael Rehaut of JPMC.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question on the margins, they continue to surprise on the upside, the gross margins, as well as the SG&A leverage. You're at 11% roughly this quarter, kind of bumping up against what you would kind of consider normal versus the previous cycle. I know you've discussed perhaps gross margins, maybe moving into the mid-20s over the next couple of years. Is that still your view? And how do you think about \"normalized operating margins\" in the next 2, 3 years?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, Mike, we're really holding short of looking too far ahead and projecting future sales, deliveries and margins. And I think that we don't -- we certainly don't want to get ahead of ourselves or encourage anybody to get ahead of where we are. What we are seeing is strength in our numbers. We have an improving environment that is yielding increased pricing, but also increased cost. We've made some very important strategic land acquisitions. We have some mothballed communities coming back online. There are a number of positives, but we're still working through an uneven kind of recovery. So I don't want to answer the question by guiding to a gross margin range. But as we sit here today, the outlook is fairly positive with increased volumes and a good strategic position.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, I appreciate that. Second question, mortgage approval process has stabilized and even marginally has begun to get better. We actually saw last week, we were with another builder that pointed to actually a new mortgage product out there, which is the first we've heard in some time. I was wondering if you could elaborate on your remarks in terms of either if you're seeing either new mortgage products out there or the approval process, elaborate on how it's getting better, either from a paperwork standpoint perhaps or just the standards overall.","Stuart A. Miller","Okay, let me take that, Mike. As we highlighted, first of all, from the mortgage approval process, appraisals have been -- appraisers have been cooperating with the price increases that we've been seeing coming through. So that's been helpful in the process in terms of the mortgage approval process for the full amount of what we're selling the homes for. We're seeing people coming out of the penalty boxes for some of the short-selling foreclosures, where they were put aside until they eliminated that. Income levels have been improving, and in general, we're seeing the trend positive in terms of approval percentages. And I don't know, Rick, if you want to add anything to that.","Richard Beckwitt","No, I think it's just been that we're seeing quality buyers out there that really want to execute. The process has gotten more streamlined of recent and things are going in the right direction. So still tough, but definitely gotten much better over the last quarter or so.","Operator","And the next question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","It's actually Alan on for Ivy. First question is just on the corporate G&A. I know you highlighted in the press release that there was an increase there from some increasing share based in variable comp. Is there any color you can give us on how to kind of think about that going forward? I know you indicated it's about 2.9% of revenues. Is that kind of a good bogey to use? Or should we think about that maybe as a percentage of EBITDA or share price or some other way that we can kind of model that going forward?","Stuart A. Miller","Sure, Alan. This quarter, because of the success we had with the bottom line, that ties directly into the way that we're compensating our management team, which is bottom line profitability. So the variable compensation expense is what drove the majority of the corp G&A increase. And then we also -- this quarter, there were some shares that were issued as well so that there was some share-based compensation expense that hit as well. I do want to tell you that there's still been tremendous focus on G&A at both the corporate and the field level, and we think there's going to be leverage as our volume picks up, but there is a component that's tied to the bottom line profitability with the variable comp expense. As far as an exact percentage, we came from the low 1%, so I think we're at 2.9% now. I think, over time, as volume picks up, that percentage should come down because a lot of that corporate G&A expense is not tied to volume increasing or profitability growing. So I do think we'll get leverage. I don't have an exact percentage to give you right now, but I think over time, we'll continue to migrate down off of that 2.9% going forward.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And on the Financial Services side on the mortgage business, can you give us any color on the composition or types of refi loans that you're doing today? Where are those loans generally sourced from? And does the composition in terms of split between FHA, GSEs, LTVs, are they similar to your purchase out in the Homebuilding business? Or is there any difference there?","Bruce E. Gross","There's a lower percentage of FHA\/VA as you're looking at the refi business. I don't have the exact percent on the refi business. Our FHA percentage came down this quarter. If you look at it, combined FHA\/VA down to about 53%, and of that 53%, FHA was 37% and VA was about 16% of that 53% number. So the sourcing of that business, it's being sourced by our loan consultants in the field. As you remember, we had a company called Eagle Mortgage that we combined into Universal American Mortgage, and we have loan consultants around the country that are focused in driving that business.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Any difference in terms of LTVs or anything, FICO scores, credit quality?","Bruce E. Gross","No, I wouldn't say that there's a lot of difference other than as far as LTV, in a refinance, you're going to have a lower LTV than you will because you're going to have less FHA business, less purchase business. So we're dealing with highly qualified buyers, FICO scores and credit quality remains high. Those people that are able to refinance do have good credit today.","Operator","The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to ask you a question with respect to your pricing power that you're beginning to see. Obviously, some of that is a broad statement about the market, but also, you've done a number of things operationally that are kind of company-specific as well. Notably, some of your product offerings are a bit different from your peers. I was wondering if you've done an analysis on the degree to which you believe some of the shifts you've made or the difference, I guess, that exists in your product offering versus your peers, think of things like Next Gen and your Everything's Included and so forth, to what degree that may have led you to enjoy better price appreciation than the broader market.","Richard Beckwitt","Well, there's no question good product sells for a higher price and we've been very successful in introducing new plans. Our Next Gen plans, The Home Within a Home have been selling incredibly well and commands a premium in the marketplace. Our EI packages, our EI platform is doing extremely well, too, especially in an environment where you've got labor issues in order to get things built. They're easier to build, they're faster to build. We take the confusion out of the selection process, and as a result, we command very decent pricing for that. We've instituted price increases across the board, and the good news is they're sticking and we've been consistently pushing prices up, really, every month. We don't want to kill the momentum out there, but at the same point in time, we're very focused on the bottom line right now.","Stuart A. Miller","Yes, just let me add to that. The pricing side of the equation is not the only part that product is instrumental in driving. Just as Rick was talking, relative to our EI platform, we've consistently said that EI enables not only an easier and more orderly program for construction, but it also helps us contain the natural trend upward in construction costs. And so while pricing is kind of reverting to normal and is kind of moving up, so, too, are costs, and our EI platform, our product strategy, is really helping us to contain that by keeping a simple program in the field and a consistent kind of SKU purchase that enables us to negotiate costs a little bit better.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. Rick, I noticed you didn't actually give me any numbers to work with, but that's all right, and follow up later. Following up, though, Stuart, on your comments there about efficiency, I mean, that really touched on something that I think folks are going to be wrestling with over the next couple of years. There's a general presumption in the market that the builders -- that Homebuilding doesn't really lend itself to economies of scale. And certainly, all the things that you've been talking -- you just talked about would seem to argue that there are. I think it's going to be one of the major determinants of just how high your operating margin can get this cycle. And so in that regard, I was thinking -- I've been thinking about the evolution of the business over the last 10 years or so, and it seems to me that the business has been -- has seen the opportunity to extract economies of scale through the use of management technology and information technology and information sharing across regions in a way that didn't exist 15 years ago. But at the peak of the market, you guys were so frenzied that my sense is that you really didn't have the opportunity to fully explore those opportunities. And so this upturn is really the first period where we're going to actually see the potential to extract economies of scale that have been made available through improvements in information sharing and so forth across regions. Do you agree with that general view? And if so, could you give us some sense, not just of what you're doing now, but what you were doing now that you couldn't do before at the peak of the cycle to give us some sense of where operational efficiency may lead to higher margins?","Richard Beckwitt","This is Rick, and then I'll flip it over to Jon. Just a couple of examples and maybe to back up, during the depths of the market decline, it was a tough experience for all of us, but it gave us an opportunity to completely restructure the way we do business. We went from purchasing materials in every division to centrally locating our regional operating centers. So right now, we've got 3 instead of 27 or 30 purchasing centers. And the visibility that we have across the country is just tremendous, Steve. Another example of it is that during the downturn, we were able to de-bundle labor and materials. We were purchasing things in the heat of the market on a turnkey basis, and now we've separated those 2 things into different cost components. Once you start doing that, it's tough for the trades to get back into a turnkey type of program. But those are some examples of how things that we've done during the downturn, things we're focused on continuing today that give us an incredible amount of operating leverage as things start to grow. Jon, any other thoughts?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Sure. Steve, the unbundling point that Rick mentioned tied together with software and technology enabled us to do takeoffs and estimates of our plans much faster than we're able to before, really gives us a clarity into the details of purchasing that we didn't have before. And when things are moving very fast, it's hard to implement those. When things were slower, we were able to implement those. And I think as things continue to pick up, that will pay off from our ability to really track material usage and shift materials quickly when we need to. And then on a pure sort of technology side, today, we have rolled out iPads in the field and our construction managers are able to communicate very quickly with architects and engineers, find solutions, communicate information. Those things that used to take a couple of days perhaps can now get solved in a matter of minutes, and all those will add to our efficiency.","Stuart A. Miller","So kind of direct answer, we're kind of thinking, as we look ahead, that there will be economies of scale that reveal themselves in this recovery differently than we've seen in the past. It is a combination of technology and the adjustments that we've made to our operating platform. And all of this dovetails very well with our Everything's Included operating program.","Operator","The next question is coming from Steve East, ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Stuart, if we stay on the cost a little bit, could you just give us an idea of what type of inflation you're seeing right now coming through your balance sheet -- or your income statement and just sort of rank order between the material costs or labor costs and the land inflation? And then looking at the land, what you're trying to buy now, Rick? You talked a lot about it. What type of inflation are you seeing in land on a year-over-year basis?","Stuart A. Miller","Okay, Steve, Jon reviewed a couple of those construction concepts. I'm going to toss it over to him and then Rick will come back on the land side.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","When you look at what's happening with the material cost, you've seen the biggest increase in lumber where that represents about 7.5% of our construction spend and you've seen that go up anywhere in the 20%, 25% range, and then you go down to other materials that most of them represent 2% or 3% of the total spend. And in total, I think we've seen probably about a 5% increase. And because that represents about 42% of our sales price, it doesn't have a big impact if any one item goes up on our margins.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then on the land side of that equation?","Richard Beckwitt","Yes, Steve, one thing to keep in mind as you look at us and you think about the land, a lot of the stuff that we're purchasing today was put under contract a year, 2 years, 3 years ago. And so it's coming on balance sheet at prices that are sub where market is today. The things we're contracting for today, if they're finished homesites, that's immediate, that's a retail type of purchase and we're still able to command 20% gross margins in that kind of stuff. Prices are up over a year or 2 ago, maybe 5% to 10% in various cases, but you've got to keep in mind that those are high ROI deals that move very quickly, so your operating leverage is tremendous if you can get good finished homesites. As far as the raw land deals that we're doing right now, there's still a shortage of folks out there that are pursuing those because there's different philosophies as to whether you want to internally develop or buy from other folks. We've been very, very aggressive in purchasing all throughout the continuum of the land curve. I've said it before, we are, I think, the best land company out there. And you've seen some of the jobs we've brought on, Steve. It's tremendous.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, I appreciate that. That's helpful. And then if we look at -- Stuart, just sort of looking at your segments and geographically, the comparative nature of your business, what's going on and what you're seeing and then just an update on your second fund in Rialto, where you stand with it.","Stuart A. Miller","Well, relative to the second fund in Rialto, because we're in the -- we're in a quiet period relative to that fund, I really can't comment on that. The one thing I will comment on in that regard is fund 1, as Jeff reported, is really performing at a very high level. We can -- we have continued to generate an extraordinary pipeline of potential deals, and that continues to enable us to invest very attractively the remaining funds in fund 1, and it leaves for us a nice backlog of opportunities that are already identified and in line to begin fund 2 as it is raised. I really can't give any color beyond that. And the first part of your question was?","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just looking at geographically and maybe price point segment, how -- what you're seeing across the country.","Stuart A. Miller","Okay, I just want to highlight that, that was a compound question, was unrelated, so we noticed that.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I was trying to slip the fund 2 in there.","Stuart A. Miller","Okay, I know the shoehorn. In any case, relative to -- regionally, I've highlighted that the recovery of market is pretty much across the country right now, but it's pocketed. And we continue to see pockets of strength in all of the major markets across the country and it's kind of expanding from there. So I really wouldn't -- I wouldn't highlight one region versus another as being -- as kind of outperforming. We do see strength in places like Florida and some of the Eastern Seaboard markets. In California, some of the markets are coming back stronger than others. In terms of price point, we still see a trend in favor of move-up purchasers. The lower end is still a little bit more constrained. But there is a recovery going on in a broad-based way across the country. It's just very pocketed and very locally focused.","Operator","The next question is coming from Ken Zener, KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could clarify, of the 124,000 owned\/controlled lots, what percent of those are owned? I think, last quarter, it was 100,000. And the kind of the breakdown of your finished lots versus your mothballed lots.","Bruce E. Gross","Sure. Out of the 124,000, Ken, about 106,000 are owned and the rest are controlled. And as far as the mothballed homesites -- I'm sorry, the finished homesites, you asked, finished homesites, let me give you a dollar amount because we don't typically break out the number as far as homesites go. Finished homesites have been running about $540 million as far as a pure finished homesite. Now if a homesite is in progress, construction in progress, there'll be a component of finished homesites included in our CIP as well. That's not right [ph].","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So what I find interesting is, I think, given your 8,000 purchases this quarter, if my math's right, you've done about 48,500 lots since the -- in the last 3 years, which should be 1\/2 of your owned inventory. Can you describe, just to be clear, your community count of 444, does that include just owned or is that owned and auctioned? And how does that kind of work out as you open up your mothballed communities next year? What's the kind of margin you're seeing on those?","Bruce E. Gross","Let me just highlight the way that we call an active community. Anytime a community has 5 or more homes to sell and it's actively selling, we call it an active community and that's what makes up the 444 number that Rick gave you.","Richard Beckwitt","So if we're not building in a community and don't have an ongoing sales presence, construction activity, it's not in our community count. The second question was on the 25% of the...","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. What the incremental -- to the extent you're saying your new lots were coming in at 200 basis points above your benchmark, how are you seeing the mothballed component come on?","Richard Beckwitt","It's pretty much in that line. The new things are about 200 basis points higher than the overall average for the company. As we bring in the legacy or inactive communities, it starts off a little slow because we want to build momentum, then, generally, we bring pricing back up. You got to keep in mind that we hung onto these communities for a good reason because we knew the markets would come back, we took appropriate value hits on the assets and we don't want to start selling them too cheap, so we're waiting for the appropriate time to bring them on board.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And what percent of the mothballed is represented in these new openings next year?","Richard Beckwitt","I don't have that with me right now.","Operator","The next question is coming from Joshua Pollard, Goldman Sachs.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The first one was, in your prepared remarks, you said that there was a little bit more visibility in planning your business. Can you talk specifically about what you guys are expecting for next year in terms of community absorption rate? I think it was 3.2 this quarter versus 2.2 last year. You're talking about 40% growth just on that metric. That's before you start getting in the community count. So could you talk a little bit about what you're expecting there and also what you guys are looking for in terms of price increases and whether or not the 8% in your backlog is a good precursor?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, Josh, we kind of knew that, that remark might spur this kind of question. We're really not ready to start going out and giving too much forward-looking guidance, and we're still keeping our view fairly short, recognizing that we are in the initial stages of recovery. What we're really seeing is a sense of consistency starting to present itself. And so as we look ahead, rather than that very rocky bottom that we endured for quite a long period of time, we're starting to see a lot of consistency in our quarter-over-quarter movements and are able to do some better planning around that, expecting that we're likely to see more consistency going forward and kind of more stability in the way things look ahead rather than saying that we're going to get out over our skis and start projecting. So we're not really giving guidance as we go ahead, but we are saying that we do have a good sense that the market, as we look over the next quarters, is likely to show some consistent trends with what we've been seeing.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Stuart, that brings up an interesting question. Back in '05 when I first picked up this group, the entire group used to give guidance. What things do you guys need to see before you'll start feeling a level of confidence to give guidance to investors again?","Stuart A. Miller","Oh boy, I'm going to let Bruce answer that.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry, Bruce. I was leaving that one for Stuart.","Bruce E. Gross","Yes, look, as we go forward, I think we'll have to look at the environment as we go, but we've given some guidance with gross margin as we've had stability. You don't have the land impairments that we've had to deal with. We're seeing the ability to raise prices, so we've given some level of our thoughts on gross margin. As far as activity going forward, I think when there's more clarity as to how many of the communities are actually coming out and whether the sales -- how much the sales pace might be changing, it will be a lot easier for us to give guidance because there's so much operating leverage, the volume's going to drive a lot of what we might guide. So I think we're going to look at this again very closely. We're in the middle of our planning season. And with the next quarterly conference call, after we come out of the planning season, we're going to be discussing what kind of metrics we can give for next year.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, sounds good. Last question, around your gross margins, you said 200-basis-point spread between your newer land and your older land at 23.5%, that simply says 24.5% and 22.5%. But what I'm trying to understand is how low are you guys willing to go on high turnover, high returns, land? What are the gross margin metrics? And how low are you guys willing to go on that metric? And then I want to understand if your mothballed land, because of the write-downs, end up at the higher end of that spectrum or at the lower end because I think it's somewhere in the middle. Mothballed, you guys could have taken a lot of write-downs versus it being older land, and I'm not sure if mothballed land is something that we should be thinking of as additive to gross margins or a bit of a detractor.","Stuart A. Miller","Well, that's a lot of questions within one. You tricky guy, you. Okay, with regard to the finished lot or finished homesite opportunities that are high ROI and lower grosses, I don't want to really give you a number for competitive reasons as to where I would draw that threshold because that gets into overall strategy. But what I can tell you is that we -- depending on the number of communities, the proximity of that community to another community that we're operating in, Josh, we'd be willing to work with a lower margin because the overhead, the incremental overhead is de minimis. So if we're drawing that line from an underwriting standpoint at basically 20%, which is what the basic threshold is across the country today, it would be below that, but not much, all right? With regard to the margin and the gross margins in our mothballed communities, I tell you that there'd be some that are high and there'll be some that are below. All of them have been appropriately impaired. But as you have some things that were mothballed, there could be some just A locations in there that we chose to not bring online because we knew that the market would be really strong at some point down the road and that we'd be selling them too cheap. Those would be infill locations that we just decided to sit on.","Operator","The last question is coming from Steve Stelmach, FBR.","Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just real quick, 2 questions, one on the FDIC impairment. I know earlier I inferred maybe you guys mentioned sort of a political process slowing our seats on some of those issues. The ID audit [ph], I believe, was due in August. Did that have any impact on that $20 million impairment? Or was that completely a separate -- entirely separate evaluation on your part?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","No, and this is Jeff. No impact, totally separate.","Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Did you see the results of that? I know you guys have been a long, strong partner with the FDIC and this seemed more politically driven than FDIC-driven but...","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","We have not seen -- I personally have not seen the final report yet. It may have been issued, but I have not seen it yet. I did see a draft.","Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then the second question goes back to the economies of scale question. When I think about your operating business, I think of it more -- the operating leverage more in terms of your land acquisition strategy, your balance sheet financing leverage. Economies of scale, while positive incremental, is that more of a secondary and tertiary issue versus the others? How should I think about that?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","The operating scale is actually a very big issue. To the extent that you bring on additional communities or you bring on additional sales per community, the incremental overhead that you have by bringing on a new community is basically the builder that you have in that community, the cost of the model in that community and the variable sales commissions associated with the sale. To the extent that you can add a community that will generate 100 closings in a year, that's a lot of money that pumps down to the bottom line. So the revenue associated with that allows us to spread the overhead across all the units.","Stuart A. Miller","I think the kind of metric that we kind of think about is that when you add absorption per community, you're only adding about 4% of SG&A. When you add a new community, an additional community, whether it's a retail developed homesite community or otherwise, you're adding about an incremental 7%, 7% to 8%, and that compares to where we are right now at 12%. So that's where you're seeing your operating leverage is, either in increasing absorption or increasing the number of communities with an already existing division. That's -- and it works in combination with all of those other factors, sales price and otherwise.","David M. Collins","Okay, great. So that will wrap up our third quarter conference call. We look forward to reporting back as we close out our year end and look forward to a continuation of recovery in the housing market. Thank you.","Operator","This will conclude today's conference.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart A. Miller","Yes, thank you, and good morning, everyone, joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end 2012 update. We're certainly pleased to share our results with you this morning. I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Collins, our Controller. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, are with us. And Jeff Krasnoff, as always, Chief Executive of Rialto, is here to participate as well.","We have recently been together and completed our year-end review and our 2013 look ahead with our regional and division presidents, and we'll share with you some of our insights. I\u2019ll begin this morning with some remarks on the overall state of the housing market. Jon and Rick will provide further color on our homebuilding operations. Jeff will update the Rialto segment, and Bruce will provide some detail on our Financial Services segment, as well as some more color on our overall numbers. As always, after that we'll open up to questions, and we request that during our Q&A time period that each person limit themselves to one question and one related follow-up. So with that, let me begin.","2012 was a turnaround year that confirmed that we had been -- what we had been seeing and communicating for several quarters, and that is that we are in fact in the early stages of the housing recovery. The recovery began in micro markets across the country, and it's continued to spread to larger pockets. In the second half of this year, recovery had taken hold across the country and has readily been seen in spite of generally negative economic data. While the current, more positive economic data still lags behind what we continue to see in the field, it, along with information from reliable economists, have instilled a new level of consumer confidence in the housing market.","While there have been and still are economic and political uncertainties ahead, we feel that this housing recovery is fundamentally based and driven by a long-term demographic need for housing. 2012, therefore, we believe, is just the beginning of the recovery as single-family starts come off their lows at just under 600,000 compared to the 50-year household formation average of 1.25 million households per year. Recent years' low housing starts and household formations have created a large pent-up demand of homebuyers who started reentering the housing market in 2012 and are likely to continue to do so into 2013 and beyond.","As this incremental pent-up demand unwinds, homebuilders are gaining pricing power. And after years of home prices falling, in 2012 the trend turned positive, initially stabilizing and then allowing for price increases across the country. Prior to this reversal, the fear of purchasing a home and losing equity kept many would-be purchasers sidelined in spite of historically low interest rates and fully loaded monthly ownership costs being low. With the added pressure of price increases, on-the-fence consumers have generally begun to come to the market to take advantage of low home prices and low interest rates.","Further fueling pricing power has been the record low levels of both new and existing home inventories as the staff inventory has been absorbed. New single-family homes for sale in November were up slightly from their all-time record low of 142,000 homes to 151,000. While existing single-family home inventory continued to decline through 2012.","Additional drivers for homeownership have been the continual increases in rental rates, which, on average, increased about 4% this year as vacancy levels reached their lowest levels in over a decade at 4.5%. It's estimated that there was slightly more than 200,000 multi-family units started in 2012, which is well below the long-term average of 340,000 per year. Across the country, homeownership monthly payments are more favorable versus rental rates. With the difference greater than it's been since the early 1970s, rental rates are projected to continue their upward trajectory due to a general lack of supply.","While rents continue to increase, the cost for monthly homeownership remains at very low levels. Impacts from rising home price increases had been largely offset by decreasing interest rates, which reached a low of 3.35% in December. If consumers are able to obtain a mortgage, they are doing so and in turn, saving money on their monthly expenses. The highly conservative mortgage market, however, is still restricted to many consumers. But with further regulatory clarity, as we've seen in recent weeks, the mortgage market should continue to open up at its margins.","In our fourth quarter, new orders were up 32% over last year, and our backlog was up 87% and the highest level it's been in 5 years. Gross margins improved to an industry-leading level of 23.5%, a 410-basis-oint increase over last year, and operating margins increased 660 basis points to 12.2%. Margins continue to benefit from our recent land acquisitions, higher home prices, lower incentives and operating leverage from greater absorption per community and more sales overall.","Our average selling price for the fourth quarter was $261,000, a 7% increase over last year. Our homebuilding operations have been improving due to a strong operating strategy complemented by an excellent management execution.","Our Financial Services segment had another strong quarter, with operating earnings of $33.2 million compared to $9.1 million last year. Our mortgage company captured some 78% of Lennar homebuyers within the markets in which it operates. UAMC has also benefited from a robust -- from the robust refinancing market. Lennar home mortgages should continue to grow alongside of our expanding homebuilding business and more than replace refinancing earnings as they begin to taper off.","On the Rialto side of our business, 2012 was a year of many milestones. Rialto closed out its first investment fund, the PPIP program, which garnered an overall 25% rate of return. In the spring, Rialto issued $132 million securitized loan inside of fund -- our first real estate fund, and that money went back into the fund to be reinvested. Additionally, our first Rialto Real Estate Fund was fully called within 6 months following its final close, and total investments in that fund are around $1.1 billion, including commitment leveraged, reinvestment of returns and co-investments.","We now have excellent visibility and firmly believe that returns for Fund 1 will well exceed expectations. The success of our first fund enabled Rialto to announce a few weeks ago the first close of Fund 2 in the amount of $260 million, with Lennar investing $100 million.","Financially, Rialto continues to contribute to our bottom line every quarter, contributing $4.6 million of operating profit in the fourth quarter and $26 million for fiscal year 2012. And as we go forward, Rialto should remain a solid earnings contributor and will create substantial long-term value for our shareholders.","Along with Rialto, 2 other long-term, value-creation initiatives have come to maturity. First, we've been incubating a multi-family rental business strategy that Rick will discuss shortly. We've assembled an all-star rental community development team and are poised to become a major participant in this market. We've also matured our FivePoint land company, which Jon will discuss shortly. FivePoint was initiated during the downturn to manage the restructuring of Newhall Land and Farming. FivePoint has now become the preeminent manager of large, complex, master-planned communities in the Western United States and will benefit substantially from the recovering market. Both of these initiatives, while not short-term earnings producers for 2013, will provide significant long-term value for our shareholders over the coming years.","In conclusion, let me say that after 7 years of navigating an unprecedented market downturn, we finally saw stabilization and recovery in 2012. As I reflect on where we've come from and where we're going, I'm optimistic that through -- that though there will be political and economic headline risks, the drivers of our business are fundamentally sound. As the housing market continues its overall trajectory back to normal, it will provide stimulus to the overall economy through job creation, as well as building consumer long-term wealth, which for generations has been a benefit of homeownership.","Today, Lennar stands alone with 5 distinct yet complementary operating platforms positioned to capitalize on a recovering real estate market. Our homebuilding machine is fully charged and continues to gain market share. It is well positioned and extremely well managed and will continue to be our primary driver of current earnings. Homebuilding is supported and enhanced by our Financial Services segment, which will grow in step with the homebuilder and continue to develop its third-party operations to enhance its bottom line.","Rialto continues to expand its franchise and invest in high-yielding alternative assets while supporting the homebuilder with access to off-market homesites. Our growing multi-family platform provides an additional long-term and complementary growth opportunity for the company and inserts Lennar's name in the -- into the homes of thousands of prospective homebuyers prior to their first home purchase.","And finally, FivePoint, with its large, long-term California land assets, simply couldn't be better positioned to reap the benefits of an appreciating land-constrained housing market. I am confident of Lennar's position in today's marketplace and rest assured that our growth trajectory is supported by a strong balance sheet with an exceptional group of people who'll be able to navigate through the challenges and toward the opportunities of 2013.","And with that, let me turn it over to Rick.","Richard Beckwitt","Thanks, Stuart. As in prior quarters, I'm going to talk about our land acquisition activities and then discuss our new apartment operations. We are really pleased with our operating results this quarter. We exceeded expectations across the board, benefiting from extremely well-purchased land assets.","During the fourth quarter, we continued our land acquisition program. This quarter, we purchased approximately 5,500 homesites for $242 million, and we spent $79 million on land development. Combined, our land acquisition and land development spend was up about 47% over the prior year period. In addition, we signed contracts to acquire approximately 2,750 homesites. From a geographic standpoint, approximately 45% of our land spend in the fourth quarter was located in the West, 26% in Florida, 9% in Texas, 8% in the mid-Atlantic, 6% in the Pacific Northwest, with the remaining 6% spread throughout our other markets.","As in prior quarters, money was invested geographically in the markets we saw the best opportunities. In Q4, we invested heavily in California and Las Vegas. We also have continued to invest aggressively in extremely high-margin opportunities in Florida and Texas, 2 of our strongest markets.","While the land market has heated up, we have found no shortage of great land opportunities. We continue to source land outside of the competitive bid environment with the help of Rialto and deep-rooted relationships with local land sellers. At November 30, 2012, we owned and controlled approximately 128,000 homesites and had 459 active communities. While we had guided to a slightly higher year-end community count last quarter, we sold out early in a few communities due to the faster-than-projected sales pace and some new community openings into the first quarter. In any case, we still anticipate ending the year with approximately 550 active communities, with the majority of these new communities coming online in the second half of the year.","On a year-over-year basis, our inventory at the end of the fourth quarter increased about $1 billion to approximately $4.7 billion, and this excludes inventory not owned, consolidated inventory not owned. During the fourth quarter, approximately 54% of our deliveries came from communities purchased or put on a contract during the last 4 years. And the gross margin on those closings was about 200 basis points higher than the company average.","Now I'd like to discuss our multi-family operation. Many of you, who follow the company, know that we've been nurturing a multi-family rental business for some time now. We entered this business following almost a decade of no new apartment supply because we saw significant pent-up demand and favorable long-term fundamentals. Despite a market rebound in the for-sale housing market, demand for rentals has accelerated, while supply remains extremely constrained. As demand for new sale housing continues to increase from historically low levels, rental demand has continued to grow, fueled by expanding household formations, credit- and down-payment-challenged new homebuyers and a steadily improving employment picture.","As a result, we believe that our core homebuilding business and our new rental segment are very complementary and that both should flourish in this recovering market. Multi-family segment began operations in early 2011 and was initially focused on maximizing the value of our underperforming single-family land assets by converting them to rental developments. During 2011, we expanded the scope of this operation to include acquiring new multi-family land assets and seized an opportunity to build an apartment business in a vibrant and growing rental market, while our core homebuilding business was recovering.","Today, our multi-family operation has a national footprint, with offices in Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Miami, Orange County, San Francisco and Seattle. We have an outstanding team of seasoned apartment development professionals for leveraging the entire Lennar organization to access development opportunities and harness the company's overall purchasing power to become a low-cost producer of Class A apartments in the multi-family space.","In 2012, we commenced construction on our 2 developments. We partnered with the Prudential Real Estate Investors for the development of a $32-million, 264-unit community in Johns Creek, Georgia, just northeast of Atlanta. Johns Creek is a highly amenitized Class A suburban infill community. The 3-story garden product is located in North Fulton County adjacent to Technology Park, an extremely low-vacancy market. We also partnered with The Carlyle Group for the development of a $36-million, 316-unit community in Jacksonville, Florida. This 4-story suburban infill community is ideally situated less than 50 yards from the campuses of 2 major employers. We expect to deliver our first phase of apartments in each of these communities by the end of the second quarter.","In addition to these communities, we have a geographically diversified development pipeline that exceeds $1 billion and over 6,500 apartments. In 2013, we plan to start construction on approximately 3,000 apartments, with total development costs of approximately $560 million. The capitalization structure for our new multi-family partnerships is approximately 30% equity and 70% debt. Lennar will invest up to 25% of the required equity, with the remaining equity contributed by third-party institutional sources. The debt is non-recourse, project-related construction financing provided by regional and national banks. From an overall capital perspective, Lennar will typically invest approximately 7.5% of the total development cost of each community. At November 30, 2012, we had approximately $30 million invested in this new business, and we see that increasing to $100 million by the end of fiscal 2013.","Consistent with our homebuilding business, our underwriting has been extremely conservative. Our underwriting assumes today's rents and targets an unlevered yield on cost of at least 125 to 150 basis points over prevailing cap rates for class A apartments. Depending on the specific deal structure and the economics, our expected returns, assuming a sale 1 year after stabilizations, should yield an IRR to Lennar's equity investment of between 25% and 45% and a cash multiple greater than 2x. While we anticipate merchant building and selling some of these apartment developments once they are stabilized, our long-term goal is to build a portfolio of high-quality, class A, income-producing properties across the country. With the benefit of Lennar's purchasing power and excellent access to unique land opportunities from both Lennar and Rialto, we feel we are extremely well positioned to become a leader in the apartment development business and create significant shareholder value.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Jon.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Thank you, Rick. And good morning. In the fourth quarter, our sales pace continued at a healthy 3 sales per community per month even as we entered the traditionally slower part of the year, and so far, we have seen continued sales momentum through December into the first part of January. Our increased sales activity has allowed us to focus on improving our pricing power. Our year-over-year average sales price increased by $18,000 or 7% to $261,000. About 40% of that improvement came from a reduction in sales incentives by 320 basis points from 12.2% to 9%. Our ability to improve our sales prices, net of incentives, has enabled us to cover the increases in labor and material costs that are occurring and grow our gross margins by 410 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2011. We believe we will continue to improve our net sales price and be able to offset ongoing cost pressures.","For the full year of 2013, we expect our average gross margin to be between 23% to 24% compared to 22.7% achieved in 2012. Let me give you some color as to what we saw with respect to construction cost increases. Together, labor and material costs are up $0.64 per square foot year-over-year. This equates to about $1,600 per home.","First, I will discuss the labor component of that, which represents about 40% of construction costs. Labor remains under pressure, as housing starts accelerate and hiring by trades is slow to gain momentum. Many trades remain cautious about hiring, as they wait to see that the housing recovery is fully established. We're seeing the greatest pressure and therefore cost increases with framing and drywall labor.","Construction Materials also continue to experience upward price pressure. As starts have increased, demand for products is outpacing the ramp-up in production capabilities by manufacturers, as they're cautious to commit the capital to reopen closed plants. As housing starts continue to rise, we expect manufacturers will add back capacity. The material categories that have increased the most over the last year are lumber, drywall, concrete, cabinet and insulation. At Lennar, we maintain an intense focus on analyzing field construction variances and value engineering.","[Audio Gap]","area to note is that cycle time has lengthened on average by 10 days as compared to last year, and it ranges from no change in some markets to 25 days in markets that are more labor constrained such as Phoenix, parts of Texas and parts of Florida. This increased cycle time, combined with a larger number of early stage sales and backlogs, will result in a backlog conversion ratio of about 75% in our first quarter. We then expect the ratio to be about 90% for the balance of the year.","I'll wrap up my comments with a brief discussion on the activities of FivePoint Communities venture in California. Their business model is to create extraordinary value by obtaining development rights for large mixed-use projects and land-constrained markets. This team manages the 12,000-acre Newhall Ranch community in Los Angeles that will ultimately have 27,000 homes and apartments and 13 million square feet of commercial uses. The first 2 maps totaling 5,500 homesites and 2.2 million square feet of commercial uses are in the final stages of completing the entitlement [ph] process and will be brought to market in the next 2 years.","In Irvine, California, located in the heart of Orange County, is the former El Toro Marine base. This master plan of over 2,500 acres will be home to the development of the Great Park, which is larger than New York's Central Park. In 2012, 5,000 homesites and 1.2 million square feet of commercial uses were approved. FivePoint has also filed an upzoning application for an additional 5,800 homesites and 4 million square feet of commercial uses. Land development has commenced on the first phase of 726 homesites where Lennar and 7 other builders will grand open 10 villages this summer.","[Audio Gap]","Park, all located in the city of San Francisco. These committees will total over 20,000 residences in almost 5 million square feet of commercial uses when completed. All 3 are fully entitled, and land development has commenced at Hunters Point. Located in 3 of the best markets in California, Los Angeles, Irvine and San Francisco, the development of these communities totaling over 55,000 homes and apartments and over 20 million square feet of commercial uses will produce significant earnings for Lennar and its partners in the coming years.","Thank you, and I'd now like to turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Rick and Stuart have already discussed Rialto's role in the homebuilding story; and as usual, Bruce will cover more of the numerical details behind our financial results as part of his comments.","The bulk of our contribution for the quarter and the year has been coming from our growing investment management business, where we invest both our capital and that of third parties in funds and other vehicles. We participate in our share of the income from our investments in these vehicles, as well as the fees and carry interest we receive related to managing those investments.","Our first investment vehicle was the public-private investment fund in partnership with the U.S. Department of Treasury and AllianceBernstein. We originally helped to raise the private equity, which was then matched with government equity and advantageous financing, providing our team with approximately $4.5 billion to invest in and manage a large portfolio of mortgage-backed securities.","During the fourth quarter, we finalized our last sales of the underlying securities in our fund and made our final distributions to the partners, including us. On average, we had $61 million of our equity invested in the fund, and we've now brought back all of that investment, as well as profits and fees, totaling $112 million while generating a 25% internal rate of return for the company, as Stuart mentioned earlier.","The Rialto Real Estate Fund was the first fund on our own, for which we raised $700 million of private equity, including $75 million from us. All of our distressed and high-yield investment opportunities since late 2010 were made through this vehicle. We've now invested, as Stuart mentioned, approximately $1 billion of equity in the fund, which includes all of the original commitments, plus another $300 million of capital we were able to recycle earlier than anticipated from asset resolutions, principal and interest payments, property income, and financings. We've been able to invest in almost 60 different transactions amounting to about $2.7 billion of assets based on unpaid principal balance for less than $0.40 on the dollar. Activities here helped to contribute over $10 million to the company during the quarter from our share of the fund's underlying earnings, including our fees and reimbursements.","Overall, our actual performance has continued to exceed our original underwriting. At the end of September, the net asset value for the fund represented a 26% internal rate of return for investors. In addition, if we continue on this path on performance, we would expect to exceed the return hurdles set for our investors, which means that over time, carried interest would import back to Rialto as the manager of the fund. And none of that potential value is represented in our earnings today.","And now that our first fund has reached full investment, as Stuart mentioned, we expect to continue our program uninterrupted through our second fund, which, in late December, had its first closing of commitments of approximately $260 million, including $100 million from us.","Earnings from our early on balance sheet investments, including our structured transactions with the FDIC, continued to lag as a sluggish environment and broad government oversight and involvement have increased our cost to levels we had not anticipated and often in advance of the related revenues. It's worth noting that we made these investments before we refocused our investment strategies utilized our funds, acquiring assets directly from banks and including more assets with invoice cash flow.","We've remained very focused on our investments to create long-term value and bring cash back into the company to be recycled. This was an active quarter in cash flow generation from these transactions, and then to date, we have brought in well over $700 million of cash to reduce debt and to begin recycling capital back to the company. Our FDIC transactions have effectively less than $100 million left in net collections in order to fully repay the original $627 million of seller financing, after which we will begin getting our capital back. We expect to begin seeing this later this year and into next.","For the near term, we continue to see compelling opportunities for our core areas of expertise, including a clearing of distressed and subperforming assets from financial institutions; the growth of CMBS finance, where we have been a market leader; and providing the vital capital and managements repositioned and refinanced real estate assets.","Looking forward, our ability to add new diverse sources of business on our already existing management base of over 230 professionals and our growing fund program and investor base continues to move us further towards our initial plan of utilizing third-party capital to drive return on investment and to create a valuable investment-management platform. We're excited about the future and look forward to reporting to you on our progress.","And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Bruce","Bruce E. Gross","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. Our net earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.56 per diluted share. This morning, there seemed to be a little confusion surrounding the tax line on our income statement.","This morning, there seems to be a little confusion surrounding the tax line on our income statement. Let me clarify that line. We had an $18.6 million net tax benefit for the quarter, which added $0.08 per diluted share. Our guidance last quarter was to assume no tax expense for the quarter. Excluding the impact from this tax benefit, our net earnings for the quarter were $0.48 per diluted share.","Let me provide a little more color to the results that you've heard this morning. The company's average sales price increased 7% year-over-year to $261,000. The average sales price by region is as follows: the East region was $245,000, which was up 11%; Southeast Florida was $264,000; that was down 1%, which was due to product mix changes; the Central region was $230,000, up 9%; Houston was $241,000, up 6%; the West region was $310,000, up 1%; and the Other region was $352,000, which was up 4%.","Our Financial Services business segment delivered another strong quarter, generating operating earnings of $33.2 million versus $9.1 million in the prior year. The fourth quarter improvement was helped by the strong refinance environment, leading to higher volumes, higher profit per transaction and strong operating leverage. Mortgage pretax income increased to $30.9 million from $9.1 million in the prior year.","We integrated the Eagle mortgage operations into our Universal American Mortgage platform over the past year, thereby leveraging both platforms and driving efficiencies. The consolidation of the back offices, secondary marketing and system enhancements resulted in a stronger platform to handle this year's increased volume. This quarter's mortgage originations increased by 52%, to $1.4 billion. Originations with non-Lennar homebuyers were 53% of the total originations, and that was primarily driven by the increase in the number of refinance transactions.","Our title company had a $2.9 million profit in Q4 and that compares with $1.5 million in the prior year. That was driven by a 31% increase in revenues. Adding a little more color to Rialto, the $4.6 million of earnings compares to $8 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The composition of the $4.6 million of operating earnings this quarter by type of investment is as follows: The first Rialto Real Estate Fund contributed $4.2 million of earnings; the FDIC portfolios contributed $800,000; the non-FDIC wholly owned portfolios had a $3-million profit. And these amounts were reduced by $3.4 million of G&A expenses and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $7.8 million.","As Jeff highlighted, we successfully completed our PPIP investment, and as a result, there is no income statement impact this quarter from the PPIP. This quarter, we reversed $45 million of the remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance, leaving the $89 million in that valuation allowance going forward. If our earnings trend continues, we expect a majority of the remaining valuation allowance will reverse in 2013.","Our balance sheet liquidity improved in the fourth quarter, with $1.1 billion of cash and no outstanding borrowings under our $525-million 3-year unsecured revolving credit facility. We continued our balance sheet strategy of pushing out debt maturities while driving down our cost to capital as we raised $350 million of 4.75% 10-year senior notes during the fourth quarter. And during the quarter, we also received the ratings upgrade from Moody's from B1 to Ba3. Our net debt to total capital improved by 80 basis points, to 45.6% over the prior year, and our strong net earnings of $679 million in 2012 was the primary driver of a 27% increase to stockholders' equity, ending the year at $3.4 billion.","Turning to 2013, while it hasn't been customary to provide earnings guidance, I wanted to summarize what has been said on the call today and highlight a few additional items for next year. As Rick highlighted, we expect our ending active community count to be approximately 550 at the end of 2013, with a heavier concentration opening in the second half of 2013. Jon highlighted our backlog conversion ratio will be around 75% in the first quarter and then should be about 90% for the remainder of the year. He also highlighted that we continue to see a positive gross margin percentage trend increasing from an average of 22.7% for all of 2012 to between 23% and 24% as an average for 2013, with the typical seasonality throughout the year.","Financial Services has seasonality as well and that will continue in 2013. We do expect that the number of refinance transactions will slow down a bit in 2013, and the profit per transaction in the mortgage business is likely to moderate throughout the year.","As Jeff highlighted, Rialto is in a transitional year. PPIP was successfully completed in 2012, and Fund 2 will be ramping up throughout 2013, so Rialto profitability is expected to be more back-loaded in 2013. Excluding the impact from additional deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversals, we expect to have an effective tax rate going forward of approximately 39%. We are well positioned going into 2013 and look forward to another successful year.","With that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I wanted to drill in a little bit on -- Stuart, on your comments related to the mortgage market. I guess my first thought is, do you think that the stringent mortgage environment is an impediment to growth for 2013, '14 and beyond, and that it's necessary for that marginal buyer to have access to mortgage liquidity? Or can you continue to show robust growth despite the fact that there is credit stringency because there's enough pent-up demand or incremental buyers that have the credit? And then secondly, on the QM, you mentioned QM was a clarity relapse. Do you have any comments for us to understand the 3% capital as it relates to your mortgage company, please?","Stuart A. Miller","Yes. As to the first question, Ivy, I think that there is a lot of pent-up demand. That's what we're seeing in the field. There's a lot of sentiment that people want to find their way into homeownership and are willing to push through a much more conservative mortgage market in order to do that. Remembering that new homebuilding is coming off historic lows and trending upward, we think that there's a lot of room for growth even in a somewhat moderated environment. I think that the mortgage market does present itself as somewhat of a limiting factor. We do not see nor do we think it's healthy for the mortgage market to revert back to the liberal standards that we came from, but a reversion to normal, which will take some time, is likely as certainty is brought back to the rules surrounding the financial market. So given the fact that there's very, very strong demand, very compelling reasons to move from a rental world to a for-sale world given the low monthly payments, and given the fact that at the margins, the mortgage market is opening up a little bit at a time, we think that there's -- there are very healthy growth prospects as we look ahead to 2013. And, Bruce, why don't I give it to you for the second part?","Bruce E. Gross","Sure, let me comment on the QM definition that just came out this past week. So there's a year before this goes into place and it's been given a year to work through some of the clarifications that are included. So this clarification needs quite a bit of further clarification, so it's unclear at this point how that's going to work out. But right now, the 3%, we think, if you include the closing costs that we contribute to the buyer in the process, if that's not included in the 3%, then it's essentially a very minimal issue. So the clarification of how our contribution is included is important to figuring that out. We have a year to work through that, so certainly no impact of this year. And we think it's likely to be worked through and we're not expecting any major impact as we go into next year at this point.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","No, that's a great answer. And I guess my follow-up question, Stuart, could you talk then about a lot of the, I guess, variables in the market that you're faced with and challenges? There's a lot of concern in the investment community about cost inflation, which you addressed, the labor shortages and certainly concern about the land inflation. It seems as if your greatest concern would more likely be about, at least from your company's perspective, is the continuation of replenishing loss as they get absorbed probably more quickly than you anticipated. Can you just give us sort of a ranking to the challenges and is that cost inflation, labor shortages, just a natural part of the cycle? And if not a concern to you, certainly, execution is everything? But I think it would help if you clarify to the investment community your thoughts on these issues that are the most pressing and yet challenging but not debilitating.","Stuart A. Miller","Well, okay. So look, I think that I said there's -- there are political and economic headwind risks out there. There's a big noise factor and some of these things can impact the market, especially consumer confidence. But I think overall, our view is that we're coming off of a very severe downturn. The fundamental reasons for recovery are really pretty solid and fundamental right now. We think, additionally, that consumer confidence is really on a recovery kind of ramp. And so I'm going to kind of take the macro picture out of the equation in terms of my biggest concerns right now just because I think that the more housing recovery -- recovers, the more jobs there are in the marketplace. The more jobs there are, the more confidence there is. And the more people are employed, the more likely they are to go out and buy a home. So to me, I kind of feel like the toughest part of the business is probably the part of the business where we are at our maximum strength and that is, in a recovering market, land becomes the biggest constraining factor. Across the market right now, it is the biggest constraining factor for builders. Driving community count and finding new locations is very difficult. I think we have the A team on the field, both between Rick, Jon and their respective leaders of the company and our Rialto complementary component. I think that the toughest risk factor, the land factor, is one that we have well covered, but I do think it's a risk out there as you look beyond 2013 into '14 and '15 as the market recovers. On the cost side of the equation, I think it's healthy and appropriate that costs start to go up in a recovering market and it actually portends better things for the economy. The fact that labor shortages are starting to present themselves and wages are starting to move up really says that the economy is on the mend, unemployment is likely to go down. And as unemployment goes down, confidence goes up. So we're going to see some cost pressure, but offsetting that cost pressure, we think, are increasing sale prices, which, if you look at the relationship in terms of percentages between cost and revenue, costs have to go up and up an awful lot before revenues don't cover. So I think that there's some risks out there. I think the macro is manageable. I think land is our area of expertise. And I think that the cost increases are actually healthy and will be offset by revenue.","Operator","The next question is coming from David Goldberg, UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question has to do with the multifamily business, and I think you guys did a great job talking about the capital allocation and the kind of capital build and equity build you guys expect in '13. What I'm trying to get an idea about is, as you look toward the future and you look at the 5 different platforms, are they competitive for internal capital? And I want to get a little more color about the decision-making process as you think about allocating capital between the businesses, because it seems like the hurdles that you're kind of solving for aren't that dissimilar between the homebuilding business, Rialto, the multifamily business and then anything else.","Richard Beckwitt","Well, I guess, from an overall capital perspective, David, I would tell you that all capital competes within the company. We invest in the individuals and the assets that produce the highest returns. That's what we've done consistently throughout this recovery. We dedicated a certain amount of capital for each platform in order to grow those platforms and create value. And depending on how each one of those platforms is capitalized, because the multifamily operation includes a lot of third-party capital, we can grow a very sizable business quickly without using a lot of Lennar capital. So we do dedicate capital to each business. The returns have a tendency to be consistent amongst all the businesses, which is a good thing, and that gives us the luxury of investing in the best of the best.","Stuart A. Miller","Let me just add to that, David, that one of the advantages that the public companies have right now is access to capital that is very, very strong, in many ways unprecedented. It gives us a lot of opportunity to deploy capital and having various arms in which -- through which to do that is, we think, a real benefit. But keep in mind that whether it's the Rialto strategy or the apartment strategy or FivePoint, all 3 of these are primarily focused on third-party capital primarily, with a small portion of company capital invested at a sizable return in line with what we do on the homebuilding side. But we're building franchise value and ultimately long-term shareholder value in building these platforms and growing them forward. It's multiple avenues for investment, limited investment in some of these programs, with a strong opportunity for franchise value in the future.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just as a quick follow-up, I kind of wanted to ask Ivy's question about labor in a different way. What I wanted to get an idea about was how you feel like your labor subcontractor force is capitalized. And do you think one of the reasons they're a little slow to react in terms of new hiring and expansion is because they're having trouble financing that expansion? And how does that affect you? And how can you guys help?","Stuart A. Miller","No, from what we've been able to see in the field, it does not seem to be that our subcontractor base is limited by their ability to capitalize their growth. We think that they're getting paid almost on a real-time basis as the competition for labor out there requires current payment. So that's not really the limiting factor. I think you have somewhat of a natural dislocation of the labor force through a downturn, where the labor force, especially in a protracted downturn, seeks and moves elsewhere and goes to other parts of the economy. Drawing that labor back is a function of job availability and wages starting to move up. That's happening in the field right now. And I think you're seeing a little bit of a timing issue that is going to work its way out.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","I would just add to that, David, that for the trade, they want to be cautious not to hire and then find that because of political noise and headline risk, the market is not as robust as it seems and then they've got to lay off again. So there's a lag time, as Stuart says, between when they'll actually feel comfortable in hiring and when we need them to be hiring.","Operator","The next question is coming from Stephen East, ISI Group.","Paul Przybylski - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Actually, this is Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. I was wondering, with respect your cost increases, are you seeing those move up at a steady rate or are they accelerating? Or are we seeing any type of plateau? And then how does that relate to the increases in ASP that you're seeing?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Well, it varies across the range of materials. It's not -- one answer doesn't fit all categories. So lumber, we're seeing lumber futures reach high levels, so that has accelerated. Concrete has accelerated. But other materials have plateaued. And I think that you're going to see a fluctuation as we look forward based on capacity to deliver those materials against the levels of increased starts.","Paul Przybylski - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I could sneak in one more. With your land purchasing right now, are you being able -- are you able to pencil deals closer to what we just did in 2012 or closer to your 2013 guidance?","Richard Beckwitt","Our underwriting assumptions haven't changed since we started buying land a couple of years back. We benefit because we're a little bit further advanced and further along the land continuum pipeline, so we're really investing today in deals for 2014, 2015. Don't be confused. We still are underwriting to extremely high margins and you can see it in the numbers.","Operator","The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan Chase.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, just on the gross margin guidance, 23% to 24%. Bruce, you mentioned some seasonality and just wondering if that would certainly then imply, if I'm just understanding that correctly, that you would expect year-over-year improvement perhaps to continue throughout the year, given the trends of home price appreciation and lowering of incentives outpacing cost inflation.","Bruce E. Gross","The answer is yes, we do expect year-over-year improvement in gross margin percentage and the seasonality, as we've seen last year, starting with lower gross margin in the first quarter and building up through the year.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Second question, on the Rialto earnings breakdown, it's been somewhat choppy in terms of the different line items and appreciate some of the clarity. And we've had PPIP closing out and it had a gain last quarter. FDIC had a loss last quarter, but part of that due to some impairments. How should we think about the FDIC, the $740 million of bank loans, the real estate in terms of trend lining throughout 2013? Should we expect gradual improvement? And also with -- as you get closer to fully defeasing the FDIC debt, would there be any type of more perhaps material improvement in those earnings? Or is that a non-factor from an accounting standpoint?","Stuart A. Miller","Let me say that Rialto continues to be a little bit choppy and a lot of that derives from the initial FDIC deal. We invested a lot of company capital in that deal with the -- with a higher expectation of return. We've talked about this in past quarters. Those levels and expectations have come down in large part because the resolution, the market for resolution of distressed loans just has been different than our past experience. And so what we're looking forward to with the FDIC program is a complete defeasance of the debt and then a return of that capital to be redeployed and at much more substantial returns. That's the negative side of Rialto. The positive side of Rialto is that every investment since that FDIC has built on that initial start-up investment and has been a success in terms of our underwriting standards which were recalibrated and the new investments coming in. So there's a little bit of an offset. There continues to be a little bit of choppiness in Rialto as we look ahead, as 2013 continues to be a transitional year. But Rialto is becoming a very substantial manager of third-party capital and investing that capital extremely well. And as we enter our Fund #2, we're expecting a lot of success and bottom line growth.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Appreciate it. Can I squeeze one more in on SG&A real quick?","Bruce E. Gross","Sure.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You had an incremental variable rate on SG&A in 2012 of roughly little over 6%. How should we think about 2013 as you're growing your community count fairly substantially?","Bruce E. Gross","Sure. So again, as we're growing our community count substantially, there's a couple of things to think about. Number one, we're still selling at a sales pace that's well below normal. So this last quarter, we had 3 sales per community per month. When we get closer to 4 sales per community per month, then it will kind of flatten out. So there's more leverage that we will be seeing in the SG&A line as volumes increase and even though we're opening new communities. Additionally, the variable expenses, we did have some doubling up last year because we had different stock awards that, that compensation expense was flowing through in 2012 and some of those are no longer being expensed. So we don't expect on the corporate side the G&A to go up at the same level. We expect to get a lot more leverage on the corporate side.","Operator","The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to ask you a sort of a general question about your expansion into multifamily. You guys more than any other builder have really demonstrated an ability to sort of move into alternative streams of profitability and this seems like yet another opportunity, it seems like a good one. I guess, in helping us understand how large this opportunity could ultimately be -- I know you've laid out some general guidelines in terms of the next year or so, but thinking out more broadly than that, are there certain -- can you help us think what the limitations are for this business, if there are any that you foresee, in terms of it relative to your homebuilding platforms in all the various markets that you're in? For example, are there ways that you can easily express markets that you're in, in a homebuilding basis that you wouldn't be interested on a multifamily basis? Are there certain resources and the types of land acquisition opportunities that you see typically that are suitable for multifamily and where there are certain limitations? Or is this a business that you could scale pretty freely relative to your homebuilding operations?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, Steve, it's Rick. Clearly, we've got the footprint out there to grow a very sizable business. If you look at the major metropolitan areas that we are in, we can scale a business relatively quickly in those markets that will be sizable. You see that within a year, we had created about a $1-billion pipeline. I think that's just scratching the surface of what the opportunity is out there, especially as we leverage the mother ship and growing this through purchasing and synergies from an overall operating standpoint. If you'd step back and when you look at the basic fundamentals of a land buyer, we are -- we often, in the past, would sell the multifamily pieces, the commercial pieces for someone else to sort of ring the bell and make a lot of money on. And as we sat and looked at what we were doing in the land market in a recovering market, it didn't make sense to not maximize the skill set that we had in place. It's easier to build a multifamily complex than it is to actually build separate homes. So what we did is we structured an organization, we've surrounded ourselves with talent and we've been building this business and it will become very sizable.","Stuart A. Miller","Let me just add to that and say that, look, one of the drivers that we had in moving forward with multifamily is, first of all, historically, multifamily has been 2, 3, 350,000 starts a year and that's consistent over a long period of time. There is a consistent demand for multifamily and we think we have a distinct advantage. We're already looking for residential land. Often, it's an appendage of a broader or bigger property that we're already purchasing. We have the Rialto eyes also out there for these types of properties. And we have the complementary construction business that's already in place, where we can leverage efficiencies over a broader community. But our general thesis relative to entering multifamily is given the severe downturn in the residential markets over the past years, given the limited supply of rental that is out there, the recovery of the housing market would be moderated by a much more conservative mortgage market going forward, which means there will consistently be a large group of people who simply can't buy a home and won't buy a home and are looking for rentals. And then all of the major markets where we build for-sale homes, there's going to be a sizable demand for rental at the same time side by side. For-sale housing will continue to recover. It'll be moderated by a sluggish or conservatized mortgage market, and rental will remain strong as well.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. Well, that's a pretty exciting opportunity and I wish you the best of luck with that. I wanted to ask you a question, if I could switch back to the more pedestrian homebuilding side of your business, and it's related to the gross margin guidance. I just wanted to clarify the guidance you've given there. For while it's strong and you guys have seen a nice recovery in gross margins already, I was -- I'm thinking that perhaps some are wondering if it could have been stronger, your guidance could have been stronger. And I'm curious, you mentioned that there is an upward trajectory in prices, but I assume that your gross margin does not assume or embed in it an increase beyond what we've seen thus far in prices. I'm curious as to whether or not that's true and also whether or not you are assuming any increases in costs next year for the units that you're going to be building next year, perhaps costs that were negotiated in a bit of a -- at the end of last year or being renegotiated now that will be at a higher level in 2013, for example, that's embedded in your assumption as well.","Bruce E. Gross","So this is Bruce. To answer your question, Steve, that is correct. We're not assuming higher average sales price increases than what we've seen, number one. And number two, we are seeing some higher costs embedded in our guidance, but our guidance is really saying that we believe we will more than offset the cost increases that we're seeing in the business right now, between sales prices going up some, sales incentives coming down, bringing in some of these new communities that we keep talking about that are at a higher gross margin than the company average, partially offset by some cost increases that we're expecting through 2013.","Operator","The next question is coming from Bob Wetenhall, RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up, I think, on Rick's comments. It sounds like Johns Creek and the Jacksonville build-out are ramping up pretty quickly. When should we start to anticipate seeing any meaningful or material impact for the multifamily business on the P&L? And what's the trajectory? You used the word in the press release, incubate? What point do you feel the business really has scale that really matters to the Lennar story?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, from an earnings standpoint, Bob, given the fact that these things take 1 year to 1.5 years to 2 years to build, you've got to lease them up and stabilize them. So you're looking at probably 3 years out before there can be a pretty decent stream of income if we're going to sell the properties. In a perfect world, what we'd do is we'd have a development operation where we'd sell the buildings, and then we would also be a piece of the operating company on the other side through a fund ownership structure where we can accumulate a huge portfolio of income-producing properties that would benefit the company on the long-term basis. So it was an earnings drag for us in 2012. It's not going to produce earnings in 2013, but in '14 and '15, you'll start to see some contribution from this new business.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just staying with the multifamily, there's some pretty established operators and there are, like, Equity Residential and Avalon Bay, but at the same time, it sounds like you feel it's not too crowded an environment. Is this just really a kind of bold call on the recovery of the multifamily segment, as well as single family?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, as Stuart and I highlighted, the growth opportunity in multifamily is pretty big today, especially given the fact that the business has been shut down from a new product standpoint over the last decade. We see significant opportunities out there. You got to keep in mind that a lot of people that play in the multifamily space are not developers, they're actually going out and acquiring existing assets out there and paying the cap rate. We do feel that we have expertise in development. It's not any different to build a condo building than it is to build a 3-story garden. And we're going to capture that development profit and, ultimately, build a portfolio of assets.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Good. It sounds like a nice complement to your core homebuilding.","Operator","The next question is coming from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. I just wanted to ask you a question about you've got the 5 different businesses and, obviously, Financial Services is most complementary to homebuilding, but then you've got the other 3, and I think you've kind of indicated in the past that maybe you would be willing to spin off Rialto in the right environment at some point in the future. Now with FivePoint and the multifamily, would you ever be willing to do that? And what kind of hurdles would you be looking for where you would come to that decision?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, just putting things in proper perspective, I mean, Financial Services is directly related to homebuilding, but FivePoint, likewise, is a direct offshoot of our land and homebuilding operations as well, so it's extremely complementary in much the same way. The apartment component is really a side-by-side relationship as well, and Rialto is a little bit more removed from our primary business. With that said, I think that the reason we highlight these other 3 businesses today is not by way of mapping out earnings for 2013 and '14, but by way of highlighting that within the company, these are the things that we've been working on that we think create long-term value and potentially might be -- we've created them with the optionality of keeping them within the company to the extent that they enhance the bottom line going forward or spinning them out as self-sustained entities as we did with LNR in the 1990s. We've highlighted that we might do that with Rialto. And these other companies also can be stand-alones at some point. It's maximum optionality for the creation of shareholder value over the long term.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the multifamily business, is a lot of the source of the land going to be coming from Rialto? And then also, have you looked at -- you kind of thrown out the longer-term multifamily start summaries. Have you looked at what kind of a normalized market share you could have of that?","Stuart A. Miller","We haven't looked at market share, what a normalized market share would look like. In terms of where the land is coming from and will come from, some of the land is coming from our own, wholly owned assets that are being repurposed for apartment and brought to market sooner than they might otherwise be in a for-sale environment. But by and large, we've used that as a springboard to develop a first-class management team. And most of the apartment rental communities or the land for those communities is being sought for exactly that purpose and is being purchased in the open market. So there are new opportunities. They might be side by side with for-sale or with something that Rialto is doing. They're not coming from Rialto.","Operator","The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani, KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Regarding Rialto, does the increased interest in REO properties from institutional investors, particularly single-family rentals, create any opportunities such as through bulk portfolio sales, through asset management of REO, assets for portfolio holders or through the market's increased demand for REO properties more broadly?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","It's Jeff. I'd say the demand really has -- has really impacted, it's more on the sales side. We've been an active seller of homes that we've taken back, but not directly from consumers but from developers that -- where we may have bought the distressed debt. I think, to date, we've probably sold about 1,000 homes. So there's pretty good demand out there for it. In terms of looking at bulk opportunities, we've also been looking at some of that. And we've been looking at some of the other opportunities that are out there that you've mentioned as we have not been a large entrant in the buying of single-family homes for rental.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Land sales picked up in the quarter and were at the highest levels since 2008. Is this onetime in nature or seasonal or would you expect a further pickup going forward? And specifically, could you look to monetize any of the internally developed land on purchases made during the market decline through an increase in land sales?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Yes, Jade, land sales continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter. So when this quarter's results do indicate that, it's going to continue at that trajectory. It will be a little bit lumpy from quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","And the last question is coming from Adam Rudiger, Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to go back to gross margins, but I wanted to talk about a little bit longer term, if possible. One, I was wondering if -- what the impact from prior impairments was on gross margins right now. And then I wanted to, Bruce, ask you what you think -- whenever you think we're going to be back in a new normal kind of environment, of normal starts levels, what you think gross -- Lennar's gross margins could be? And the reason I ask is because I think there's a lot of optimism built into your company and into the industry. And some of the -- my competitors' estimates and some of the new estimates I've talked about with investors seem to suggest that gross margins in the next upswing are going to exceed prior cycles and that history is not going to repeat itself and you're going to have better gross margins. So I was just curious what you thought of that and if that's the way you think things are going to play out.","Bruce E. Gross","So with respect to the prior impairments going through our gross margin, it's not a number that we've tracked, but what I would say is that, that number isn't -- I won't expect it's very significant as we've been growing our volume and we had over, I think, it's 54% of our deliveries were coming from new communities at this time. So that's not a very large number that's flowing through the P&L, is what I would expect. And going forward, as far as gross margins, we think there are a number of opportunities for the gross margins to continue to grow. And obviously, we've talked about some of them today. Average sales prices are still well below where they were at the peak. And with affordability being very high, there's room for average sales prices to grow, especially as inventories, as constrained as it is, and the rent versus buy equation is in favor of buying. We have more new communities coming online. The gross margin in the new communities is still over about 200 basis points above the company average. And we have sales incentives that are continuing to have the ability to continue to decline. And then you have costs that will go up, but that's a smaller percentage of the equation because your costs are less than 1\/2 of the sale price. So going forward, there's room for it to go up, but I think we just want to moderate it. We want to see the results first before people get too carried away with the gross margin in their models.","Stuart A. Miller","Right. Let me just say that we are looking ahead with a conservative view. As we look at the market in general, as we look at land constraint, as we look at the recalibrated cost structure that we and others have in place, and as we recognize that home prices are not skyrocketing and shooting up, but they are reverting to normal, which means, in part, the base price of homes is going up. And in comparable part, we are eliminating an incentive structure that has been rather dramatic in order to sell homes during a downturn and that is working its way out. There's real opportunity for margins to go up. We're going to cautiously look ahead, seeing our margins go up in orderly progression. But I think that there is opportunity to the upside in terms of margin growth. And I think that's a large part of why you're seeing a lot of people who look at the housing market today look ahead to the next couple of years and say, with land shortage and with a reversion to normal in pricing and elimination of incentives, there's a lot of opportunity for margin growth.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I think that's exactly why I'm asking the question because -- and I just -- I guess, what do you think the -- I mean, a lot of the things you talk about makes sense, but those things have to happen, all of your competitors have to act that same way, so do you think there's a -- is there -- traditionally, the industry liked to say 18% to 20% was the gross margin and that's what everybody said. And do you think there's an industry kind of cap where incentives might be where they are and you can reduce them, but somebody's going to then lower them to take some share? So how much of your optimism, recognizing you're still being conservative, but how much of that might be tempered by the industry's structure? And how do those 2 levers counteract each other?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, I think we have seen that in prior recoveries. As I look back, we've certainly seen that as the market recovers, people do sometimes moderate the margin they can get with the one that they trade off for volume. What -- but the governor here is the scarcity of land. You just can't replace the most important commodity as readily as we've seen in the past. And therefore, when you look at the competitive landscape, if someone's got a good land position, they'd better harvest the best margin that they can or that land is going to dissipate and they're not going to be able to replace it. That's the governor that's out there and why we think that margins have more opportunity to the upside than risk to the downside. All right, listen, thanks, everyone, for joining us on our fourth quarter update, and we look forward to reporting through 2013.","Operator","This will conclude today's conference.

Sir, you may now begin.","Stuart Miller","All right. Very good. Thank you, David, and thanks everyone for joining us for our first quarter 2016 conference call. This morning I\u2019m joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto are here as well along with a few other members of our management team.","And Jon Jaffe, is joining by phone from California. Some of this group will join for our Q&A period. I\u2019m going to give some brief remarks to begin about the business, Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial picture. And then as always we\u2019re going to open up to Q&A. And as we have in the past, we\u2019d like to request that each person limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","So let me begin and let me begin by saying that our first quarter 2016 marks the beginning of yet another year of strong operating results for the company. Even while the month of December was defined by the first interest rate hike by the Fed since the great recession, which turned into capital market turbulence and fears of recession as we entered calendar 2016. We have seen only mild negative impacts to our business and have continued to be able to perform, as expected.","The management teams across our platform has \u2013 have recognized the challenges of these sometimes complicated market conditions and have adjusted strategies to meet those challenges and have often turned them into unique opportunities. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain very well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of those segments.","In light of the FED\u2019s move in interest rates early in this quarter and the turbulent market conditions that followed, let me speak briefly about our outlook for the housing market in general. There have been some questions raised about the relationship between housing and interest rates, about the possibility of recession, about consumer confidence in a globally terror-stricken world, and about the implications of a God-awful election season in the United States.","In times like these, it\u2019s probably best to put the blinders on and focus on the road ahead, because it seems almost impossible to avoid the distractions of the environment around.","To answer the questions directly, we feel certain that modest moves in interest rates tied to low unemployment and some wage growth will be a net positive for housing. We do not see the telltale signs of recession. Global terror seems to highlight that the U.S. is the safest place to be and to invest in the world and teach U.S. citizens focused right here at home. And that\u2019s for the election. Well, they say that America always gets to the right answer right after we\u2019ve tried all the wrong ones, we\u2019ll see.","As we\u2019ve noted consistently over the past few years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit, and this is resulted in a growing pent-up demand. Stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, modest wage growth, and general consumer confidence are still driving consumers to form new households and to rent and to purchase apartments and homes. We expect the demand will continue to build and come to the market over the next years, and will drive increased production at the deficit and housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished.","Land and labor shortages will continue to constrain supply and constrain the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, while the mortgage market will continue to constrain purchaser\u2019s access to mortgages. These conditions will continue to result in slow and steady positive homebuilding market conditions and will enable slow, steady, though sometimes erratic growth across our platforms.","This has been our consistent guiding themes for the past years and we\u2019ve mapped our strategy around this view. Even with the somewhat erratic conditions that defined the first quarter, we\u2019ve remained resolute in our view and have it here to our strategies.","Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for sales Homebuilding operations have performed extremely well in the first quarter. Our results reflect slow, but steady growth in the over homebuilding market, as our new orders increased 10% year-over-year.","Even while continued labor shortages in land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has carefully managed sales prices, maximize margin, and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain strong net operating margins.","We have noted in the past quarter conference calls that given the now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage our growth in order to grow our bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We\u2019ve moderated our growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 8% to 10% range, as we\u2019ve redirected our management efforts towards creating operating efficiencies and leveraging SG&A.","We\u2019ve also talked consistently about a soft pivot in our land strategy away from the land heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery. And we are now targeting land acquisitions with a shorter two to three-year average life. Generally, we\u2019ve moderated our land spend as a percent of revenues, and this will be reflected in future quarters. This has been and will continue to be the strategy driving our homebuilding platform as we manage land acquisitions to taper the growth rate in both community count and home sales.","With less pressure on growth rate, we can intensify management focus on driving bottom line growth, cash flow, and maximizing pricing power, while using innovative strategies to drive SG&A down. Under a company mantra of what we can manage, we can change. We are focused on changing and improving quite a lot in operations. As one example of this focus, we\u2019ve been working on reducing customer acquisition costs.","We\u2019ve been moving our spend away from conventional marketing and advertising to a digital platform. We\u2019ve learned that digital advertising can be much more targeted and much less expensive. We believe that once fully implemented, we will see up to a 50 basis point reduction in SG&A, while driving an increase in qualified traffic. In the current quarter, we\u2019re already starting to see results from this initiative.","With demand growing steadily, land limited labor type and constrained mortgage availability, we feel that we\u2019re in an excellent environment to run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate with strong bottom line profitability and strong cash flow by measuring and changing our way to greater efficiency and performance in our core for sale Homebuilding segment.","Next our financial services group has had an outstanding first quarter as well. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we\u2019ve also benefited historically from a strong though sometimes erratic refi market, as well as from expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. These sidecar opportunities will continue to expand in 2016.","Our strategy for the future for Lennar Financial Services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business, but drives profitability from retail operations as well.","Bruce Gross oversees this operation and we\u2019ll discuss it further in his comments. The first quarter has continued to display our outstanding positioning for LMC, Lennar multifamily communities as well. We closed one property in the quarter and continue to develop our extensive over $6.5 billion pipeline of quality properties across the country.","Our multifamily program continues to complements our for sale operation. Since household formation has recovered at a slower rate than expected, a new households have been more inclined to rent than purchase. We address these markets with rental communities that are desired or can be afforded.","First time home purchasers have come back to the housing market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While approximately 30% of our for sale homebuilding business continues to be geared to first time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has been named primarily at the rental market.","We\u2019ve continued to expand our national footprint and grow from a merchant build program to a build to own program. In the first quarter, we got equity commitments for an additional $300 million for our Lennar multifamily venture to bring our raise to just over $1.4 billion. Our apartment strategy is proving to be very well-timed, as rental rates continue to climb and vacancies are at historic lows. More rental product is going to continue to be needed and we are well-positioned to continue to fill this need and grow our multifamily platform.","Also in the first quarter, our Rialto segment saw both challenges and opportunity. While the collapse of the capital markets in the beginning of the calendar year negatively impacted current quarter earnings for Rialto, the volatility did create unique opportunities for investment for the future.","During the quarter, volatility within the capital market pressured the pricing on a variety of fixed income products, including new issued commercial mortgage-backed securities. Accordingly, Rialto mortgage finance, RMF saw its net spread dwindled to unusually low levels, while volume dropped as well. Although profit expectations were mess, excellent management kept us in the black in the stress market and Rialto was able to make strategic purchases of CMBS B-pieces at advantage prices for future profitability.","Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across real estate and financial product types as an opportunistic play on the long duration of this economic recovery. The dysfunction in the financial markets along with new risk retention rules will ultimately work to benefit \u2013 to the benefit of Rialto\u2019s core competence in CMBS and financial products and will continue to grow as a best-in-class manager.","Finally, let me mention briefly, our FivePoint properties strategic investment and its management team, which positions us to continue to benefit from some of the best located land in California as that market continues to improve. As noted in our last conference call, FivePoint has confidentially filed a registration statement for an initial public offering. Of course, the difficult market conditions of the first quarter have kept to some sidelines, but we\u2019ll keep you posted as further information becomes available.","In conclusion, let me say that, we\u2019re very pleased to prevent \u2013 to present our first quarter results this morning. We feel confident that our view of the market and the strategies that define our business segments have worked well to position us for continued performance and for future growth. As I said in the past many times, we\u2019re very confident that we at Lennar have the right people, the right programs, and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future.","With that, let me turn over to Bruce.","Bruce Gross","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the first quarter were $144 million, which is a 25% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 25% in the first quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 12% increase in average selling price to $365,000.","Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 22.7%, which was in line with our expectations. The prior year\u2019s gross margin percentage was 23.1%, the decline year-over-year was due primarily to increase land costs.","Sales incentives as a percent of home sales revenue continue to decline as this quarter was 5.6% versus 6.3% in the prior year. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East and West regions. Direct construction costs for our single-family detached homes were up 5% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot and that was driven primarily by labor increases.","Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of home sales revenue improved 60 basis points to 10.8% in the first quarter. We were successful in improving SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and additionally we continue to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. This resulted in the lowest first quarter SG&A percentage in our history.","Operating margins on home sales also improved and this was improved by 20 basis points to a 11.9% in the first quarter. This quarter, we opened 62 new communities to end the quarter with 684 net active communities. New home orders increased 10% and new order dollar value increased 15% for the quarter. Our sales pace was slightly higher compared to the prior year at 2.9 sales per community per month versus 2.8 in the prior year. The cancellation rate decreased to 15% in the first quarter from 16% in the prior year.","In the first quarter, we purchased 10,300 home sites totaling $537 million versus $421 million in the prior year\u2019s quarter. We continue to focus on our soft-pivot land strategy. However, our land spend in 2016 is weighted more heavily to the first-half of the year. Our home sites owned and controlled now totaled 168,000 home sites of which 132,000 are owned and 36,000 are controlled. We continue to carefully manage inventory as our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,200 homes, which is in our normal range of one to two per community.","Our Financial Services business segment had strong results with operating earnings of $14.9 million, and that compared to $15.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income decreased to $13 million from $14 million in the prior year. And mortgage originations increased 2% to $1.7 billion from $1.6 billion in the prior year.","Refinance volume decreased 47% year-over-year, which created a more competitive market for the remaining purchase business. We did, however, increased our purchase origination volume by 17%, as a result of increased Lennar home deliveries and expanded retail presence. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improves to 82% this quarter from 79% in the prior year. Our title company\u2019s profit decreased slightly to $2 million in the quarter from $2.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower volume versus last year.","Our Rialto segment produced operating earnings of $1.9 million compared to $4.6 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of noncontrolling interests. The investment management business contributed $23.2 million of earnings, which includes $1.5 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $21.7 million of management fees and other.","At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate funds one and two combined now totaled $136 million. Rialto mortgage finance operations contributed $380 million of commercial loans into two securitizations with an average margin of 1.6%, totaling earnings of $3.9 million for the quarter, and that was before their G&A expenses.","Our direct investments had earnings of $1.8 million and Rialto\u2019s G&A and other expenses were $20 million for the quarter and interest expense was about $7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $112 million of cash.","The Multifamily segment delivered a $12.2 million operating profit in the first quarter, primarily driven by the segment\u2019s $20.4 million share of a gain from the sale of an operating property, as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. The apartment community sale this quarter was in Mountain View, California and was sold to a firm providing corporate housing for companies, including Google and Facebook. This will be the most profitable apartment community sale this year.","We ended the quarter with six completed and operating properties, 28 under construction, five of which are in the lease up, totaling over 8,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $2.1 billion.","Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 28%. The rate was benefited by a favorable settlement with the IRS, as well as the extension of the new home energy efficiency credit. The remaining quarters of the year should have a tax rate of approximately 34%.","Our Southeast Florida division has grown successfully and was operating from Vero Beach to Miami. As a result in the first quarter, we split the division into two operating divisions to maximize operational efficiencies. The Southeast Florida segment no longer meets the reportable segment criteria and is now part of the homebuilding East segment.","Turning to the balance sheet, liquidity remains strong with approximately $511 million of homebuilding cash and $500 million of borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Our leverage improved by 240 basis points year-over-year, as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 45.3%. We grew stockholders equity by 18% to $5.8 billion, and our book value per share increased to $27.11 per share.","During the quarter, we converted $163 million of our 2.75% convertible notes for $163 million of cash and 3.6 million of shares with an average price of approximately $44. At quarter end, the remaining balance to be converted was $71 million.","In March, we issued $500 million of five-year senior notes at 4.75%, which will be used for working capital and to retire our $250 million, 6.5% senior notes. This will continue to reduce our borrowing rate, while extending our maturities.","Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. 2016 homebuilding goals are right on track with the guidance we gave in December with just a couple of quarterly refinements. Deliveries are still on track to be between 26,500 and 27,000 homes. We expect the backlog conversion ratio in a range of 80% to 85% for Q2, 75% to 80% for Q3, and 90% to 95% for Q4.","Operating margins are still on track to be flat to down 50 basis points for the entire year. The full-year gross margin is still expected to be in a range of 23% to 24%. The second and third quarter are expected to be at the low end of this range, and the fourth quarter is expected to be at the high-end of the range. We are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A percentage in our company\u2019s history in 2016 with the greatest leverage coming in our higher delivery quarters in the second-half of the year.","Our other company goals are all on track except given the turmoil in the capital markets, we now expect Rialto to earn between $15 million and $20 million for 2016, and that\u2019s weighted more heavily towards the fourth quarter. We\u2019re off to a strong start in 2016.","And with that, let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Robert Wetenhall","Good morning, and congratulations on a really strong quarter. Stuart, just taking from your remarks, I was hoping you could give a little bit more original detail in terms of how the spring selling season has started to unfold. You guys saw tremendous delivery growth in the Central West regions and I was also curious what you are seeing in Houston and how it is compared to prior years?","Stuart Miller","Okay, good, Bob. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Rick and to Jon to give a greater detail on the regions.","Rick Beckwitt","Yes, I would tell you from a \u2013 an overall standpoint, we saw good sequential improvements throughout the quarter, December being the lightest and clearly February being the strongest month, pretty much spread across every operating territory that we\u2019ve got, and I\u2019ll address Houston in a little bit. We saw that with regard to both home sales activity as well as pricing, so we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019re entering the sale season, although we\u2019re at a very beginning stages, because our quarter ended on \u2013 in February.","Geographically, we saw \u2013 the numbers are pretty similar. Probably our toughest market was Houston, sales were down 3%. But I think we\u2019re outperforming the market there, because on the new home side, as we calculated the market was down about 10% during this comparable period. We saw good pricing power, because we are as Stuart said and Bruce mentioned earlier balancing pace and price there, sales prices were up about 5%.","Our margin took it a little bit on the chin, because we\u2019re keeping our inventory active. And we are optimistic that we\u2019re going to pace \u2013 starts to deal with the market on the higher price points with lower price points still performing extremely well, but once you get above 350, 400,000, it\u2019s down quite a bit.","And we anticipate the numbers that you\u2019ve seen in the magnitude, as I said last quarter around 5%, 6% down for the year is where we think we\u2019re going to end up. But we have tapered back our starts, given some of the weakness on the higher end. Jon, you want to talk about any western markets?","Jon Jaffe","Sure. Bob, as you know California is too big to refer to as one market. So as you look at the segments in Southern California, we\u2019re seeing good strength in Orange County, San Diego, and LA, that\u2019s not only supported by our activity, but when you look at our FivePoint master plan communities at the Great Park you\u2019ve seen that same seasonality Rick described, but selling at almost four sales per month per community for the builders at the Great Park. At Valencia, we\u2019re seeing over three sales per month per community. So it shows very good activity in those markets.","Northern California, the Bay Area remains very strong, really defined by a shortage of both housing and particularly in Silicon Valley by a shortage of skilled labor in the tech and biotech world. So that continues to feel demand there. And then in Sacramento, we\u2019ve seen a nice recovery where that\u2019s become a strong market.","Inland Empire, Central Valley, I described more stable, good markets, healthy, not as robust as Northern and Southern California. And then across the rest of the West, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, all very stable markets. And then the Pacific Northwest, we can see continued good strength up there again defined by a very strong job demand and very short supply of housing.","Rick Beckwitt","And then if you look at the other big markets we had, Bob, Florida was clearly a \u2013 we\u2019re seeing strength there, and the other markets in Texas were up pretty big deal. So in our largest areas, California, Florida, and Texas were doing extremely well.","Robert Wetenhall","That\u2019s a great summary. Thank you. Wanted to ask and maybe this is for Bruce to address. Your gross margin guidance 23 to 24 reciting some pressure there from land and labor costs, at the same time, you\u2019re making very, very big strides in managing SG&A. Stuart said you\u2019re managing what you can measure. And I\u2019m not really asking about 2016, but as a company when you\u2019re thinking about net margin and profit \u2013 profitability going forward in 2017 and 2018, are you thinking that like a 20% plus, or 22% gross margin is sustainable, given current pricing trends in land costs, and how much more opportunity do you have to leverage SG&A? Thanks very much. Good luck.","Rick Beckwitt","So, Bob, this is Rick. I\u2019ll take the margin side of that for the next couple of years. Clearly, we\u2019re continuing to benefit from some of the land that we purchased in the last cycle, going back to 2009, and some of the land that we\u2019re continuing to close, I was put under contract a couple of years back. As we move later in the cycle, it\u2019s going to be more difficult to keep the margins up where they are now. But we are underwriting deals today north of 20% across the Board and we\u2019re being relatively conservative with regard to pricing.","So as we look at it, the company has historically done \u2013 produced a margin that\u2019s north of 20%. And it\u2019s the balance of fine finished home sites on a retail basis and doing some pivot and doing some land development, where you\u2019ve got some wholesale purchasing.","Bruce Gross","And one thing to consider is, we\u2019re focused on two things. We\u2019ve got a race car that\u2019s on the racetrack that is moving through year-after-year, we\u2019re buying land and we\u2019re selling homes. And at the same time off the track, we are refining the engine and we\u2019re tuning it up. What we can measure, we can change is a major focus off the track.","We are looking at refining various component parts of our business, I\u2019ve given one example, we have others in our pipeline. And we think that the opportunity to refine SG&A is more significant than what we\u2019ve outlined, but we don\u2019t want to set out pipe dreams that have not been proven yet.","So we\u2019re trying to give examples, as we undertake them. But we think that there can be a lot of refinement in SG&A, as we go forward. We\u2019re pretty optimistic about where our net operating margins are going to hold steady.","Robert Wetenhall","Got it. Thanks very much. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Stephen Kim","Okay. Sorry about that, guys. Can you hear me?","Stuart Miller","Yes, we hear you.","Stephen Kim","Okay. Yes, sorry about that. Yes, so good quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit about your land spend. I think you gave a figure of $537 million. I think that was \u2013 was that just acquisition, and if so, can we get sort of the break out of acquisition and development in the quarter?","Stuart Miller","Sure, Steve. The $537 million was just the acquisition. The land development spend was $271 million, and that\u2019s down about $20 million from last year\u2019s first quarter.","Stephen Kim","Got it. And that rate of land spend, do you feel like there was anything in that number, which was a little elevated relative to your expectations going forward over the remainder of the year?","Rick Beckwitt","Yes, Steve, it\u2019s Rick. As I said earlier on the markets, we closed on \u2013 probably half of the land that we acquired in the quarter was in Florida. Deals that we\u2019ve been working on for really past a couple of years that just came to fruition now, really excited about the positioning that we acquired. And I think you\u2019ll see as we move through the year, the land spend sot of taper down.","Stephen Kim","Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Next question was just about Next Gen. Can you give us a sense for roughly how much of your sales are utilizing that sort of a multi-generation, or a multi-generation type floor plan? And just in general, how have you seen that portion of your product array performing?","Jon Jaffe","Hey, Steve, it\u2019s Jon. For us we\u2019re seeing over 5% of our net sales is coming from our Next Gen platform. We continue to roll it out across more and more of our markets. A good example of that is recently a bigger push in Texas, where we\u2019re seeing a very good receptance of the product as we bring it to market there, continues to sell very strong in some of our markets where affordability is more of a pressure like Arizona, Inland Empire, Central Valley, we see tremendous demand in those markets, Florida, as an example sees very strong demand.","So we\u2019re very bullish on the product. Similar to Stuart\u2019s comments, we continue to refine and learn as we go and make sure that we are tweaking that product to meet what we\u2019re hearing back from consumer demand side.","Stephen Kim","Great. Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.","Ivy Zelman","Good morning and congratulations guys, nice quarter. Stuart, you talk a lot about \u2013 well, not a lot, but you spoke about digital marketing and appreciation of the opportunity to leverage SG&A. I guess, did you can may be expand on the marketing in absolute dollars and what you think what will drive this internally, is there collaboration, people understand, and maybe you could give us some examples, because I think the word digital marketing, I think, we kind of get it, but maybe you expand on that please?","Stuart Miller","So, look, we\u2019ve focused on the broader concept of customer acquisition costs and that cost is about 10% of our SG&A. There is a large opportunity to reduce that cost. The first part of that is the migration from conventional to digital marketing. If you think about it, conventional marketing is going to a newspaper ad and basically shot gunning across the white population, a message that might or might not resonate with that population.","Using an example, we think first time homebuyers as most likely to decide to purchase a home when they\u2019re getting married or one they\u2019re having children. In a digital platform, we can target our message to people who are looking for wedding dresses or purchasing cribs, that\u2019s a more targeted focused audience and it costs a lot less to target that group.","Digital marketing enables a greater penetration to the people that we want to hear our message, less scattered delivery of our message at a much, much lower cost. That\u2019s been driving our marketing and advertising costs down and we\u2019re at the front end of that. There are other benefits that will flow from that as we become more proficient at that form of marketing. And I think that our industry and our company are the front end of really redefining what that cost structure can look like.","Ivy Zelman","Well, that\u2019s really helpful. I guess, the internal buy in and appreciating all the divisions are they doing it by themselves, or is it coordinated? Can you give people a better understanding how the collaboration works?","Stuart Miller","So changing a group of divisions that operate fairly independently across the country is a little bit complicated. We have \u2013 the way that we have kind of focused on rolling out our thinking is, first, we proved concept in one division. We had one division teach a second division to see if the metrics still hold true. And then we basically have used a metric calculation and almost game within the company to create a competition to roll this out across the company.","And we\u2019ve seen this program really take hold across our company and start to create a great deal of enthusiasm around not only a focus on migrating from conventional to digital marketing, but really on looking at broader concepts around SG&A as well. So I think we\u2019ve kind of laid what I would call transmission lines throughout the company to really foster change and roll it out across a broad spectrum.","Ivy Zelman","Sounds great. Well, good luck with that. If I can sneak in another one, you guys had talked a lot about the opportunity to generate consistent cash flow and improving returns over the cycle and just looking at cash flow that you actually had outflows versus generating cash. Can you talk about what we should be expecting with respect to cash flow? And what you think this \u2013 the opportunity is on cash flow going forward?","Stuart Miller","Sure. We started talking about ourself pivot and land a couple of years ago. And we started a process think of the homebuilding business more like a cruise ship than a speedboat, there\u2019s a lot of momentum in the direction that we\u2019re headed. It\u2019s hard to turn in short distances. The land acquisition program is that kind of a momentum program. We start negotiating land positions years in advance of actually closing them. Rick has already articulated that our land spend this quarter in large part derived from negotiations and contracts that were entered into two and three years ago.","So as we look out towards future quarters, we\u2019re going to see the work the redirection that was put in place two years earlier. So over the next quarters and over the next couple of years, we\u2019ll see our land spend subside as a percentage of total revenues, and we\u2019ll see the impact of that soft pivot.","As I articulated, our land today as we focus on land acquisition is generally targeted towards two and three-year duration land purchases. That doesn\u2019t mean where we find a unique opportunity that we won\u2019t buy something larger, we most certainly will, because we\u2019re opportunistic in that way. But it\u2019s going to be priced in a certain way. Generally speaking, you\u2019ll start to see that soft taper be incorporated in the numbers that were reported that\u2019s not the case for this quarter.","Ivy Zelman","Got it. Thank you, and good luck.","Stuart Miller","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen East with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Paul Przybylski","Thank you. This is actually Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. I was wondering if you might be able to give us a little bit more color on your entry-level strategy. I think you said it was 30% of your business this quarter. How did that compare to a year ago and if it\u2019s up, has it had any impact on margins? And then what regions would you be seeing more of a shift entry-level? And then on the Houston side, is there any pressure from the multifamily operators that might put its way through to the entry-level buyer in that market?","Stuart Miller","So first on the trend line for first time buyer, you\u2019re right on 30%. It\u2019s up from about 25% of our mix from the prior year. I think as you start to look at us going forward, you\u2019re going to see in the markets that would include Texas, Carolina, Atlanta, Florida, that those percentages are going to go up as we move through and the balance of this year into 2017, consistent with the land strategy that we articulated going back a couple of years.","So on a mix basis, I think, you\u2019ll see probably a 10% to 20% increase in the amount of first time penetration that we\u2019ll do in those specific markets. And as we said before, we\u2019re really not chasing tertiary business on the first time side. These are more infill oriented first time positions and but we\u2019re not going out to what we would normally call the C type markets. Does that answer your question?","Paul Przybylski","Yes, I guess. But and then we have heard some rumors that the apartment operators were starting to give a couple of months rent free in Houston. Has that started to work its way into entry-level demand? I know you said they\u2019re under, I think 250 price point has remained rather strong?","Stuart Miller","We haven\u2019t seen any impact from the multifamily side on the for sale side. But Mark there\u2019s just not a lot of inventory to be had and that benefits us as well as the other builders in the market.","Paul Przybylski","Okay. And then one final question your conversion was a little bit better than we expected. Is that a function of just better weather this quarter, or are we actually start to see true improvement in labor? And if so, do you think that holds going into the second-half of this year, or are we going to still have some kind of hangover like we saw in the second-half of last year?","Stuart Miller","Jon, you might want to comment on the labor picture?","Jon Jaffe","Yes, we\u2019re not really seeing a recovery on the labor picture. I think that we look at it internally from Lennar perspective, or everything is included platform combined with our scale and market share in the markets that we\u2019re in really allow us to manage that very effectively. Everything is included in particular is a very simple program in this environment. It benefits our trades, and it benefits us, particularly as we manage our job side readiness and being prepared for the environment. So that we can manage it on a daily basis by having a simple program.","So we\u2019ve seen a very steady environment for us in terms of cycle time, very little increase in cycle time year-over-year. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the labor market is improving any.","Paul Przybylski","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","John Lovallo","Hi, guys, thanks very much for taking my call as well. First question is, you discussed the trend of some first-time buyer shifting towards rental. I\u2019m wondering, if you are seeing any increased demand from other demographics may be on the move down segment?","Stuart Miller","There\u2019s no question that that there has been movement in a number of segments. Clearly, relative to the empty nesters rethinking their living conditions, there has been some movement in the direction of rental versus homeownership there as well. So we\u2019ve seen that the rental option, the reduction in homeownership rate is something that is broader than just affordability, it reflects also appetites and desires that have evolved since the recession. And we think that some of those trends will continue.","John Lovallo","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of the digital marketing strategy, if I heard you correct, I think you guys talked about a 50 basis point potential, it benefits the SG&A over time and maybe even a little bit more. But for the 50 basis point, specifically, did you guys give a timeframe of when you think that\u2019s achievable?","Stuart Miller","I don\u2019t want to get out over my skies and start wrapping timeframes around this. The rollout of a program like this and its adoption is something that gets incorporated, as culture allows change to happen. So we see this as an opportunity, but the 50 basis points is a starting point for us. We think there\u2019s a lot more fuel in that tank around customer acquisition costs, which is a larger broader number in just marketing and advertising.","And so I think what I would say at this point to stay tuned, we\u2019ll give further reports on this as it develops. There are other areas of SG&A that we\u2019re also targeting that we think technology, measurement, and focus can bring change in reduction to and I\u2019d say, again, don\u2019t want to get out over our skies that I want to make promises that we can\u2019t live up to. So over the next quarters, we expect to be reporting more on that.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Stuart Miller","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Stuart Miller","Good morning.","Michael Rehaut","First question I had was just in terms of \u2013 Stuart, your opening remarks, right at the top you kind of mentioned the Fed rate hike and some of the volatility in the markets during the first couple months of the year and you said since kind of almost for \u2013 kind of quote here since the Fed rate hike, you seen only a mild negative impact, struck me is a little surprising giving up the order trends or kind of right in line with our estimates and expect your expectations.","What you were referring to exactly when you kind of said mild negative impact? My only thought would be perhaps the reduced profitability of Rialto. But I was wondering, if there\u2019s anything else because obviously sales pace was up a little bit and I believe John also talked about good improvement in order trends throughout the quarter and across all regions. So I was hoping to get a little more granular there?","Stuart Miller","Well, Mike I think that the comment was \u2013 what I was trying to get across is, look you saw a shock to the financial system and clearly within the Lennar environment, the biggest shock \u2013 a shocking ripple through RMF and the capital markets approach through Rialto. But relative to our company, it was relatively minor in scope.","Really homebuilding, if you look at it, step back from it, rode through some pretty tumultuous timing in the first quarter, pretty much unscathed. There might have been some pullback in some consumer confidence and we all that kind of on the edge of our seats waiting to see how the spring selling season might present itself.","And I think there was a lot of question as questions about recession in the U.S. economy started to kind of gain steam among economists. So I think that what I was trying to express is that it was a shock to the system. There were some impacts to certain parts of our business though they were minor, the homebuilding side really rode through it intact and there was a little bit of anxiety in terms of anticipation about what might evolve and I still think that people are staying tune, because they don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a complete view that we\u2019re out of the word. So we\u2019re going to have to wait and see what that says and see how markets present themselves. I hope I communicated that all right.","Michael Rehaut","That\u2019s helpful and kind of what I thought, but it\u2019s good to hear you verbalize that for clarity\u2019s sake, particularly on the homebuilding side. Secondly, just kind of looking at big picture and you kind of mentioned the soft dividend and how you\u2019re adjusting as the cycle matures? I was hoping that if you could just kind of revisit capital deployment over the next two to three years in a broader scale, and specifically now that as severe ancillary businesses. I believe are still your capital neutral in terms of the requirements, if not you give me back some capital what that might mean in terms of the other the balance sheet from a leverage standpoint and also any thoughts around share repurchase?","Bruce Gross","So our balance sheet is getting stronger every quarter, we have profitability reflecting on equity or adding to equity. We have in December a convert that is converting that will be in addition to equity \u2013 I\u2019m sorry to November, thanks Bruce. Our balance sheet continues to get stronger just by the operation of our business.","In terms of cash flow, as noted in an answer to an earlier question, turning the tide on land acquisition and actually turning to that real cash flow program with a lower growth rate and a soft dividend our last strategy will take some quarters still ahead of us. But with our ancillary businesses at least neutral some of them cash flowing positive, apartment still being somewhat of the cash flow negative. We really think as we get into 2017, we have four to five balance sheet, we continue to recast our business with our soft-pivot.","I think that we\u2019re going to see the cash starts to come in. It\u2019s most likely to start to reduce our debt dependence and that\u2019s where our focus will be initially. And then ultimately with excess cash from operations, we will start to buy back stock. But that\u2019s not going to happen in 2016.","Michael Rehaut","Okay, no, it\u2019s helpful. And then one last quick one if I could squeeze in technically just a clarification. In terms of the 2016 guidance other than the Rialto adjustment in terms of the expected profits there, the only other thing I was able to gather was that the tax rate is going to come down slightly relative to the first quarter benefit and that impact on the full-year 34 for the next three quarters. But other than Rialto and the tax rate, it did appear that all the other elements of guidance were reiterated, is that correct?","Stuart Miller","That\u2019s correct, Mike. We just had some minor shifts between the quarters, as I gave that detail, but otherwise everything else should be the same for the year.","Michael Rehaut","Right, great. Perfect. Thanks so much.","Stuart Miller","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Mike Dahl","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start out with the SG&A and maybe take a step back to some of the divisional changes, because it clearly seems that aside from just the efforts to lower customer acquisition costs and transformed digital, you\u2019ve found plenty of other areas to lever SG&A. And then if anything is tracking, at least, at the high-end or even better than the guide for the full year.","And so I\u2019m wondering if there are anything anything \u2013 any other things like splitting of divisions that we should be thinking about for the next couple quarters that, at least, from a near-term standpoint are creating some additional costs that won\u2019t really be levered until maybe later in the year, or next year, or just how to think about kind of the cadence of the SG&A improvement?","Bruce Gross","Mike, this is Bruce. As you look at the cadence of the SG&A improvement, it\u2019s really coming from two main areas. It\u2019s the focus on digital marketing and it\u2019s the operating leverage, because our additional deliveries are coming out of existing divisions other than the one division split that we mentioned.","So as you think about that cadence, we\u2019ll have more homebuilding revenue as you get later in the year, so there will be more leverage later in the year. So that\u2019s the way to think about the cadence.","The second part of this year is going to have a bigger improvement in SG&A and that\u2019s driven by the increased volume.","Mike Dahl","Right. I guess on a year-on-year basis and though I guess what I was getting at is, it seems like the current guidance some ways could even be conservative. And just wondering if just given the level of improvement, you\u2019re already seeing and then you will be getting into better leverage quarters and some of these initiatives will be gaining traction. So I guess just wondering how to think about the level of conservatism, or if there are other one-off costs we should be thinking about of why we shouldn\u2019t see the same magnitude of improvement as we go through the year?","Bruce Gross","Well, look, we are investing in technology. So there\u2019s obviously some other costs involved with our focus. But for the most part, you\u2019re looking at similar leverage that you saw in the first quarter and the second-half of the year, as you\u2019re looking year-over-year. And that\u2019s going to be driven by the volume increases. So there isn\u2019t a lot of additional other costs to really think about.","Mike Dahl","Got it, okay. And then just shifting gears to RMF, I guess, Rialto as a whole was a product of the overall Lennar strategy of being very opportunistic at the right points in the cycle, and as you see things changing. And so just curious how you\u2019re \u2013 you made some comments about you\u2019re looking at it as you\u2019re now looking at this and some of the challenges in CMBS is being an opportunity. And so it does feel like it\u2019s potentially early on and some disruption in that market. So just wondering if you can give us some sense of just how you are managing to or mitigating some of the near-term risks and balancing that versus potentially looking at some opportunities to expand that part of the business?","Stuart Miller","Okay. So remember that we\u2019ve been in the CMBS markets for a couple of decades now. We\u2019re probably one of the most \u2013 we\u2019re probably the most seasoned participant in those markets. We\u2019ve recognized the ebb and flow of demand and supply in CMBS markets. And we recognize we see when the market dries up, sometimes there\u2019s more demand than there is supply and we generally sit on the sidelines as we are right now.","At those times, the demand side seem \u2013 tends to go away. And as the supply side starts to come back, presents unique opportunities for the participants that are still there to participate. So the way we think about that market is in recognizing that ebb and flow uniquely relative to its market recognizing the dysfunction generally works to our favor, given our experience.","I think that the events of the past quarter will tend to drive participants out of that market might sideline the supply side of the market for a period of time, it will ultimately come back and we\u2019ll be well-positioned to be a leader in the market as it reemerges. So that\u2019s kind of the way that we think about it, but our position derives directly from our long-term experience. Jeff, you want to add to that?","Jeff Krasnoff","I would just say just anecdotally on the buy-side in terms of our investment vehicles, we\u2019ve actually, I\u2019d say over the last three or four months have probably been some of the busiest since we\u2019ve been in business just on the buy side just because it\u2019s been such a diminution and demand at the end of the day.","Stuart Miller","And the capital markets ended up taking a lot of the participants out of the market. So there weren\u2019t any buyers there.","Jeff Krasnoff","Exactly. And from the loan origination perspective, which is the other side of business, I mean and again that gives us sort of a leg up on really understanding what\u2019s going on there, there you saw the widening out of spreads. So and we\u2019ll see how that market behaves going forward as the supply and demand ebbs and flows is doing there.","Mike Dahl","All right. Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful.","Stuart Miller","Okay. Let\u2019s have one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutche Bank. Your line is now open.","Nishu Sood","Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on some of Rick\u2019s comments. Rick mentioned the first-time buyer percentage, which is 30% has been roughly that we could expect to see some improvement, I\u2019m sorry, some gains in that 10% to 20%, I think you said. And that a lot of your investments were in closer in area. So I just wanted to dig into that a little bit. You would think that the opportunity for closer in first-time product would necessarily be limited just because if you have a highly desirable closer in lot, you maximize your returns by putting a more expensive product on it.","So just wanted to get a sense of how much growth potential do you see in making these closer investments. What would drive? What would you folks need to see in the market to begin to move out to a more traditional further out, call it, areas that tend to support first-time buyer demand. So just wanted to get a little more details and your thoughts on that, please?","Rick Beckwitt","Okay, so let me just reiterate. In the markets of Texas, Carolina, Atlanta, Florida those areas, we\u2019ve been targeting for the last year. So couple of years to increase our first-time presence by about 10% to 20%. Most of that focus going back a couple of years ago was in securing land positions that were more closer to where people wanted to live in the tertiary areas. And you can do that generally in the markets that we\u2019ve talked about, because there\u2019s still good employment, there\u2019s good transit.","As a result of that those positions are going to be higher IRR type of opportunities and lower gross margin opportunities, because you just don\u2019t have the juice in those deals to really get a higher margin. They\u2019re more retail oriented positions that\u2019s not to suggest that we aren\u2019t moving out into a little bit further commute oriented places, but you won\u2019t see us going out \u2013 outside of what I would call core markets. Hopefully, that answers your question.","Nishu Sood","Got it.","Stuart Miller","Just to add some clarity was that we don\u2019t see those same opportunity that Rick described and say Texas, Carolina and Florida, so with more traditional markets to say, Central Valley and Phoenix will be more like our company average 30%, 35% affordable, but in your other markets in the west as I went through them earlier, they really isn\u2019t that opportunity, unless you go way out in tertiary markets and we\u2019re just avoiding that and not chasing that business.","Nishu Sood","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And another question just in terms of the recovery and where we\u2019re at, one of the \u2013 in closer in areas that the move-up market, which is Fed most of the recovery so far, there\u2019s been some concerns that with pricing, gains now in their \u2013 going to the five year. Some pretty strong pace of games that we had in 12 and 13 in terms of home price, appreciation that affordability is potentially a constraint on \u2013 because the housing recovery continuing. They\u2019re closed from a volume perspective, there\u2019s a lot of no room to grow. But what are your broader thoughts on that? And especially if you could give some context from what you\u2019re seeing on the ground in terms of affordability issue.","Stuart Miller","Yes, I think Nishu, that\u2019s a good way to wrap up into \u2013 to bring it to an end, bring our call to an end. And in that regard, I think that we continue to see fairly strong demand. I think affordability is a looming question as prices have tended to go up. They tend to go up because the supply, we read about it, see it all the time both on existing homes and new homes just fairly tied and the demand as we emerging. It hasn\u2019t emerged, but it\u2019s still emerging and I think that there is a sizable pent-up demand.","Your question about move our purchasers in the market were generally still seeing relative strength across the board from first-time buyers all the way through to move up. There are certain markets that are little bit different. The Houston market as we\u2019ve noted has been softer with higher end, the California markets have remained robust.","So it\u2019s not a national picture anymore. We have to look at local markets more directly \u2013 but we\u2019re still seeing strength. I think the thing to remember for everyone in the back of your mind is that you have to measure affordability against the alternative and the alternative is what is the rental market look like? What is the rental option and was rental rates moving up and more and more people are thinking to kind of stabilize their outflow of capital, our personal capital into their housing cost like purchasing as opposed to renting because on an annual basis, the rental rates are going up.","So that that picture is one that continues to define the housing markets today, a production deficit supply is tight, demand is growing, rental rates are going up and the affordability picture is a bit of a question, but I think in the mix that it probably gives way to a strong consistent slowly growing housing market.","And with that, I think we\u2019re going to bring it to close and say thank you all for joining us and we look forward to continuing to report on our progress.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. And that conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining.

Miller","Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our third quarter 2013 update. We're very pleased to share our results with you this morning.","This morning, I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you've just heard from, who is our Controller; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto, are here with us for our Q&A session. And Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, is available for Q&A from California by phone.","I'd like to begin this morning with some brief overview comments on the overall state of the housing recovery in the context of today's ever-changing market conditions, and then briefly overview our operations. Bruce then is going to, as usual, provide greater detail on our overall numbers, as well as some further comments on our Financial Services segment. And then, as always, we'll open up for Q&A.","As in the past, we'd like to request that during Q&A, each person limits themselves to one question and just one related follow-up.","So let me begin. In preparation for today's call, I reviewed my comments from last quarter's conference call to consider those comments and see how my thoughts might have changed. When we reported last quarter, our results were very solid, though the interest rate environment had begun to change, and talk of the pending taper of federal stimulus had just recently begun. We believed then, as we do now, that, generally speaking, the housing market remains in a solid recovery mode and is likely to continue to improve over an extended period of time. While the rate of that improvement is likely to moderate as the market has now snapped back from the abnormally severe downturn that we experienced, we nevertheless believe it will continue to improve.","Clearly, interest rates have moved higher and mortgage rates have moved from their unprecedented low point towards more normalized levels. Accordingly, over the past couple of months, we've experienced a slowdown in our sales pace and traffic in our communities as the consumer has adjusted to the change in the interest rate environment. But it is our belief that this change is mild and temporary given the extremely low levels of housing inventory in the market. In our view, the primary driver of our business strategy is that the housing recovery is still very much intact and that the fundamentals of that recovery remain solid.","The overriding driver of recovery in the housing market remains the production deficit of both single family and multi-family product throughout the economic downturn, and up to and including this year.","This year, even with significantly stronger building activity, we will produce approximately 900,000 to 950,000 single and multi-family dwellings, and again, will underserve the country's needs by a wide margin. We have more than absorbed the overbuilding of the early- to mid-2000s and have been underproducing for a protracted period of time. This shortfall will have to be made up, and the builders of both multi- and single family products have been pushing to increase production as inventories of rentals, existing homes and new homes have remained extremely low, and pricing for all of these products have been moving up. And inventories are likely to remain low as production increases are constrained by a shortage of entitled and developed land to build on.","Interest rates, though somewhat higher, are still at historically very acceptable levels. Consumer perception at this point remains that today's low interest rate still presents a unique opportunity to lock in a very low cost of capital, and this opportunity might not be available forever. Even with more significant movement in both interest rates and pricing, homes remain affordable by all measures and will continue to remain attractive relative to rental options as well.","Finally, while demand for homes has been constrained by an overly restrictive mortgage market, which has limited access to home ownership with highly conservative underwriting criteria, the landscape continues to improve as lenders are beginning to reconsider their credit underwriting overlays and open the doors for more approvals. While this process has been and continues to be slow to mature, we've come a long way since last year at this time, and we expect to see further easing of credit standards to normalized levels and further extension of credit to the markets.","As we've seen over the past quarter, there have been, and still are, economic and political uncertainties ahead that will affect and bring questions to the future of housing. The pending debt ceiling debate, the future of the taper discussion and the international swirl around Syria and the Middle East will all produce bumps in the housing recovery road. We continue to feel, however, that this housing recovery is fundamentally based and driven by a long-term demographic need for dwelling units. We believe we're still in the beginning stages of a recovery that will be sustained for several more years. And strategically, this is how we are positioning Lennar for the upcoming years.","Now turning to Lennar specifically, we feel that our company is really hitting on all cylinders. Lennar has been and continues to be very well positioned for current market conditions and recovery in housing. This is reflective in our third quarter 2013 results and in our positioning for the future.","In our third quarter, new orders were up 14% over last year, while our new order dollar value of $1.5 billion was up 32% over the prior year. Our dollar value of backlog is up 53%.","Gross margins improved year-over-year to an industry-leading 24.9%, a 170-basis-point increase over last year. And operating margins increased 350 basis points to 14.7%, reflecting the powerful operating leverage in our platform. For the fourth quarter 2013, we expect that our gross margins will remain consistent with current levels.","Margins continue to benefit from our aggressive land acquisition strategy, as well as higher home prices and operating leverage. While recent sales have seen a mild increase in the use of incentives on selected inventory, margins are remaining steady.","During the quarter, we continued our aggressive land acquisition strategy and closed on approximately 11,600 homesites for approximately $610 million. And that land has basically been contracted for between 1 and 2 years prior to its closing. Additionally, we spent $160 million on bringing land to developed status and ready for production.","Our average selling price for the third quarter was $291,000, a 13% increase over last year, which covered the increases in labor and material costs which increased approximately 8.4% over the prior year to around $45 per square foot.","Lumber costs have been -- have recently come down, but this has been offset by increases in labor. The most labor-constrained categories are framing, drywall, plumbing and concrete. We expect that costs for fourth quarter closings will be slightly higher than our third quarter. But our average selling price of homes in the third quarter was up 16%, and those price increases will continue to cover the increase in costs.","Our Homebuilding operations continue to improve due to the strong operating strategy, strong land position, complemented by an excellent management team and management execution. Additionally, we opened 77 new communities and closed out 57 communities during the quarter to end up with -- to end up at 514 active communities, a 16% year-over-year increase. Today, we are fortunate to have land in hand to meet our projected deliveries through 2014 and much of 2015 as well. And as a result, we're pursuing land opportunities for 2015 and beyond.","Complementing our Homebuilding operations, our Financial Services segment had another strong quarter, with operating earnings of $23.5 million, down slightly from the $25.3 million last year. Our mortgage company captured some 70% -- 77% of Lennar home buyers within the markets in which we operate.","The mortgage operations have benefited from a robust refinancing market in past quarters that -- and that part of the business is now starting to subside. Lennar home mortgages continues to grow, however, alongside our expanding Homebuilding business, as well as serve a number of non-Lennar purchasers in a growing number of markets, making up some of the shortfall from the slowing of the refi business.","While our Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our 3 additional operating segments are all maturing to be excellent longer-term value creation platforms for the company.","Rialto continues to grow as a blue chip capital investment management company and commercial real estate capital provider. While current earnings have slowed as we have shifted from the balance sheet investment model to a fund investment model, the prospects for future consistent earnings continue to improve.","In Fund 1, we invested approximately $1 billion of equity in 60 separate transactions, and actual performance continues to well exceed our original projections. So in addition to being able to recycle and invest an additional $300 million of capital with only 2 -- within only 2 quarters subsequent to becoming fully invested, we have already been able to distribute $365 million to our investors, or over 50% of their initial capital contributed.","In addition, if we continue on our current path, the carried interest to Rialto as manager of the fund will exceed our expectations, and none of that potential is yet reflected in our current earnings picture.","While Fund 1 is now fully invested, our opportunistic program has continued uninterrupted through our second real estate fund, which has already closed private equity commitments of almost $650 million compared to the $260 million reported at the end of the second quarter. And this is well on its way towards our goal of raising approximately $1 billion by year end. Fund 2 has already invested over $230 million in 17 separate transactions.","And following on the theme of high-return-on-capital businesses, earlier this year, we brought on board one of the industry's most experienced commercial real estate origination groups led by Brett Ersoff and John Herman. Our initial objective for Rialto Mortgage Finance has been to originate and securitize long-term fixed rate loans on stabilized, cash-flowing, institutional-grade commercial real estate properties. And this program is now well on its way to profitability.","Although the shorter-term earnings have slowed, we have morphed into a private equity and high-return-on-capital program, and our Rialto program is maturing on plan. We are very excited about the long-term prospects for value creation from this platform.","As with Rialto, we're really pleased with the progress of our multi-family rental business. This business began operations in early 2011 and is positioned to become one of the leading developers of new Class A apartments in the United States. We have assembled a seasoned team of professionals that is leveraging every aspect of our company.","In the third quarter, we commenced construction on 2 new apartment communities and now have seen -- and now have 7 active projects totaling 2,100 apartments with an estimated development cost of approximately $326 million. Including these active communities, today, we have a geographically diversified development pipeline that exceeds $2.5 billion and over 11,000 apartments. As we've discussed in the past, we're building these apartments with third-party institutional capital, and each deal has been conservatively financed with non-recourse debt.","In addition, we have underwritten our investments using today's rents and unlevered yield on costs that are 125 to 200 basis points over the prevailing cap rate. With our conservative financing and underwriting, we're positioned to earn IRRs exceeding 25% and cash multiples greater than 2x.","We anticipate that the construction of our development pipeline will be completed over the next 3 to 4 years. As a merchant builder of apartments, we plan to sell our apartments once rents and occupancies have stabilized. Given our construction timeline, we should begin to see returns on invested capital by the middle of 2014 with a more meaningful contribution from the multi-family segment in fiscal 2015.","Finally, our FivePoint Communities program continues to mature as a long-term strategy as well and is quickly moving to bring developed land in premium California locations to the market to fill the growing demand for well-located, approved and developed homesites. In the second quarter, we saw the first earnings contribution from this division which will continue to contribute as additional land becomes entitled and developed over the next years. Again, we believe that FivePoint Communities will create excellent long-term shareholder value.","In conclusion, let me say that while we are aware of the concerns that are being reflected in current market volatility, our company's strategies continues to be driven by our belief that the market remains positioned to continue to recover, and that our company remains well positioned to benefit.","The housing market is healing and recovering, and we -- as we produce shelter that is needed for a growing population and return to more normal levels of household formation.","Lennar's Homebuilding operation is extremely well positioned and continues to gain market share. We have excellent land positions in all of our major markets while the overall market is still very constrained, and we have continued to fortify that position. Our Homebuilding operations will continue to be the company's primary driver of current earnings.","Homebuilding, of course, is supported and enhanced by our Financial Services division, which will grow in step with the homebuilder and continue to develop its third-party operations to enhance the bottom line.","Our ancillary businesses of Rialto, Lennar multi-family communities and FivePoint continue to mature and expand their franchises and will continue to provide longer-term opportunities to enhance shareholder value in the longer term. Although there continues to be political and economic headline risks, the primary drivers of our business are fundamentally sound. I'm confident of Lennar's position in the marketplace today as our strong balance sheet and exceptional group of leaders will continue to be able to navigate through the challenges of today's market landscape and towards opportunities ahead.","With that, let me turn over to Bruce.","Bruce E. Gross","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning.","Our net earnings for the third quarter were $0.54 per diluted share, and I'm going to review the financial highlights, starting with Homebuilding.","Our results reflected strong top line growth as our revenues from home sales increased 55% in the third quarter, driven by a 37% increase in deliveries and a 13% year-over-year increase in average sales price to $291,000. That sale price by region is as follows: the East region was $261,000, up 7%; Southeast Florida region was $299,000, up 8%; Central region, $261,000, up 16%; Houston was $272,000, up 15%; the West region was $361,000, up 21%; and other region was $394,000, up 10%.","The 24.9% gross margin that was up 170 basis points over the prior year was driven primarily by new communities purchased after 2008, which continued to outperform the company's average gross margin and they represented in this quarter 61% of the company's deliveries.","Sales incentives were $18,700 per home in the third quarter, or 6% as a percent of home sale revenue. The sales incentives improved by 330 basis points, or $7,400 per home delivered versus the prior year. The gross margin percentage for the quarter was the highest in the East, Southeast Florida and West regions.","SG&A percent as a percent of revenues from home sales improved 180 basis points to 10.2%, and we are realizing significant operating leverage as our Homebuilding volumes increased. That resulted in a 350-basis-point improvement in our operating margin.","Additionally, we have seen significant operating leverage in our corporate G&A line as our corporate G&A improved 60 basis points to 2.3% as a percent of revenue during the quarter.","During the quarter, equity in the earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was $10.3 million versus a loss of $6 million in the prior year. This is primarily a result of income related to the sale of homesites at our El Toro joint venture to third-party builders.","Turning to Financial Services. As Stuart mentioned, our earnings were $23.5 million in the quarter versus $25.3 million in the prior year. Our mortgage pretax income decreased during the quarter to $18.8 million from $22.3 million in the prior year.","As I have been highlighting for a few quarters, we have been expecting the number of refinanced transactions to decline and the profit per transaction to moderate, and we did see that in our results this quarter.","Our Eagle Mortgage retail channel experienced a reduction in refinance volume from 49% of the total originations being refinance-oriented versus now 26% in the current quarter. Our Universal American Mortgage Company subsidiary provides mortgages to our home buyer customers and, therefore, almost all of these are purchase transactions. In total, our mortgage operations are now 88% purchase transactions and 12% refinance transactions.","This quarter's mortgage originations increased by 7% to $1.4 billion as we have been effective in growing our purchase transactions to offset the reductions in refinances. However, there has been margin compression in the market as a result of more competition targeting the purchase business.","Our Title Company had a $5.2 million profit in the third quarter, and this compares with a $3.6 million profit in the prior year. And this is on a 7% increase in revenues.","Turning to Rialto. We generated $1.5 million of profits compared to $7.7 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The composition of those profits by type of investment is as follows: the Rialto Real Estate Funds contributed $5.2 million of earnings; the FDIC and wholly-owned bank portfolios contributed a net of $2 million of earnings, and these amounts were reduced by $5.7 million of G&A and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $9.3 million.","One thing to note, the prior year amount included $15.4 million of earnings from the PPIP program, which was successfully completed in 2012. The FDIC originally provided $627 million of seller financing, which had to be repaid before we could make distributions back to the company. As of today, we now have enough cash in Rialto to fully retire the remaining debt balance, which will allow us to make additional distributions in the coming quarters to the partners. Additionally, it positions Rialto with an underlevered balance sheet.","Turning to our balance sheet, our balance sheet liquidity remained strong in the third quarter, with $434 million of cash and $100 million outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility. During the quarter, that credit facility was increased to $950 million, and its maturity was extended to June of 2017. Our stockholders' equity increased to $3.7 billion during the quarter, and our book value per share increased to $19.10.","Our homesites owned and controlled now total 147,000 homesites. 119,000 are owned and 28,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory remains low, averaging about 1 home per community.","I wanted to summarize what's been said on this call and highlight a few additional items for the remainder of 2013.","First, we remain comfortable with our backlog, and we continue to expect to deliver between 18,250 and 18,500 homes for all of 2013. This will result in a backlog conversion ratio exceeding 90% for the fourth quarter.","Second, the strength of our backlog has given us confidence for our gross margin guidance to be maintained around the third quarter actual gross margin level of 24.9%.","Third, Lennar Financial Services' earnings are expected to decrease sequentially from the third quarter as we book our mortgage profits based on loan locks, and this is due to the normal seasonality that occurs in our fourth quarter.","And then last, our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 36% as we were favorably benefited by several tax credits which were applicable to the third quarter. And as we look at the fourth quarter, we now expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 38%.","And with that, let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Bob Wetenhall, RBC Capital.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask -- it was a strong quarter in terms of gross margin performance and incremental operating leverage. Could you help give us a sense of where you see gross margins going in the next 2 or 3 years if volumes continue to recover?","Bruce E. Gross","So Bob, looking forward, as we think about gross margins, there are several opportunities still for gross margins to grow. We think we have the opportunity for margins to exceed our past peak, which was around the 26% to 27% range if everything goes according to plan. And that's based on the following: it's based on average sales prices continuing to grow as there's still room and affordability; sales incentives still have room to go down from the current 6% level over time to what's more normal at 3%; we have more of our new communities that would come online that have a higher gross margin than the company average. Currently 61% of our deliveries, as I mentioned, were coming from new communities, so that should be helpful as well. And then as absorption increases and gets back to normalized levels, we have the ability to amortize fixed costs over more deliveries. So if everything happens according to plan, there is room for upward mobility in the margins over time. We think the next quarter, however, will probably be somewhere close to the level that you saw in the third quarter that we just reported.","Richard Beckwitt","Hey, Bob, this is Rick. Just one other thing I'd point out is, as we have typically discussed in the past, we're more focused on our operating margin than by -- than the gross margin. We're very focused on leveraging the overhead, the infrastructure of the company. We will, within any quarter, adjust pricing and pace to maximize the underlying value of the assets. So gross margins will move up and down, but the real thing you should focus on is the operating margin line.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's really informative. I appreciate the granular detail. If -- on a follow-up, Stuart had said that interest rates are probably having an impact on order growth, but he characterized the impact as been temporary and mild, and touched on the production deficit. If rates stay in the current context for 30-year fixed, how do you think the recovery looks from here on out during the next 12 months?","Stuart A. Miller","Bob, it's our view that the recovery -- it just continues forward. I think that the first move in both sales pace and pricing has been stronger than people anticipated, in large part because it's a reversion as opposed to just a straight-line recovery. When I say reversion, we had a very, very unusual downturn. It was much more severe than we've seen historically, and I think there's been somewhat of a snap back. The fact that the rate of growth in sales and sales price will and should moderate does not derail the recovery. We think that the recovery will be more orderly and slower in nature. But we think that over the next 3 to 5 years, we're likely to be in a steady recovery mode.","Operator","The next question is coming from Stephen East, ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Stuart, you talked about what you were seeing with demand a little bit, if you could talk a little bit more just what you all were seeing as you went through the quarter and post-quarter for demand and pricing? And then as you go through this a bit slower time, what's your strategy? Or how has your strategy changed a little bit to navigate through this period?","Stuart A. Miller","Yes. Let me turn that over to Rick and then to Jon. They have a real close -- they're in close touch with the people in the field, and you'll get a better answer from them. Rick?","Richard Beckwitt","As we look at the quarter, Steve, I would tell you that July was the slowest month for us, and we saw August actually being the strongest month on both a nominal and year-over-year basis. That was pretty much consistent with both number of sales and dollar pricing power. There was a little bit of sticker shock associated with the rate increase so dramatically, a little pause on the market, and we saw buyers starting to come back to the market. And as Stuart said in his opening comments and his talk about the economy, we see just strong viable fundamental demand out there. But it's cooled a little bit. As a result of that, we have -- from a pricing standpoint, we've selected some of our inventory, select inventory, and have increased some incentives associated with that inventory. But blended across the overall pool, it's got a relatively modest impact on pricing and net sales price. It varies dramatically by market. The A communities are performing extremely well, and -- but we're really focused on discounting. If there was discounting on stuff that was ready to close and we -- it was just the best way for us to focus on a return on investment. Jon, any further comments?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","As we manage through what is apparently more of a normal season, as Bruce highlighted, we're focused on our unsold inventory, which is about one home per community. And we'll manage the levers of price and pace to make sure those homes are delivered, they're sold and they close, and that will create some fluctuations from community to community. But as I look at our backlog and look at the end of third quarter sequentially compared to the second quarter, I feel very comfortable that we are managing our average sales price in a level or upward trend and the same with our gross margin. So I think we managed through this somewhat bumpier time because our inventory is under control -- we're not under pressure to incentivize any greater than the market needs to keep that pace.","Richard Beckwitt","And just a final thought on that, Steve. I think this is at the top of the mind of the market right now. What we're hearing from customers in the field, clearly there's a little bit of sticker shock relative to interest rates moving. At the same time, the prices have been moving up. We saw across the country, in the Case-Shiller report this morning, that prices are up in a healthy way. And so, as interest rates have moved, people have had to confront the fact that the price that they were looking at a few weeks ago might be different than the price -- or the monthly payment might be different than today. But by and large, they still have to measure their decision on where they're going to live against rental rates. And they still have to -- and they still have the opportunity to look at reasonably low interest rates that are going to hold them in good stead for years to come. The attitude of the consumer in the field still seems to be positively oriented towards finding a way to purchase and making it through the mortgage maze right now and finding their way into homeownership.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's really helpful. And then, if we look, you can grow 1 of 2 ways. You can buy the lots and the land or you can buy the company. There are -- both are pretty fluid right now on the M&A side. We're seeing some small deals, but then we also have the 2 big ones that are sitting out there and the land environment itself looks like it's getting a bit more rational. Can you talk about those 2 and how you all view your appetite for potential M&A? And then, what's actually going on in the land market?","Stuart A. Miller","Yes. As has been the case with our company for a very long time, there is nothing that we don't look at and consider. We look at M&A the same way that we look at organic growth. It's all about competing capital, and we measure the returns on capital that we can generate from a company acquisition against comparably deployed capital in a well constructed organic program. And wherever the best returns for our company are going to lie, that's where we act. So there is nothing off the table as it relates to Lennar. We are focused on and have reviewed every M&A transaction that's out there, and we are looking at just about every organic opportunity to purchase new land positions. It's all about returns on the invested capital.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Has the land market changed?","Richard Beckwitt","Yes, Steve, this is Rick. The land market has been going through a state of evolution, as we've discussed in the past because there are more ready-to-go, finished homesites out there that have been priced up. That's not to say that you can invest in communities that produce a good return and a decent gross margin. But clearly, not the margins that we've seen in current deliveries. And as a result of that, as Stuart mentioned, most of our land acquisition activity or contracting activity -- and I want to really focus on that -- things that we've been putting under contract are things that we'll probably be closing on in 2015, 2016, 2017. We benefit from the fact that we were early in, aggressive and you can see that reflected in the gross margins.","Operator","The next question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Two questions, and one question really pertains to incentives. Recognizing, I think, the way you described it, Stuart, is that you're using it selectively where necessary to move inventory. Maybe, Rick, you were the one that said it, 1 per community. One of the concerns we have is that unlike any other cycle we've actually seen pricing spikes at the front end of the cycle and volumes usually are the ones to increase and follow that pricing. So now that we've weaned the consumer with the spike in pricing, off of incentives after 6 tough years of negotiations, aren't you opening up the door for a slippery slope of undermining consumers' confidence in the value of the homes they're buying? And not just you, I'm talking about the industry because there a lot of private builders that want to take their working capital out of the ground, and we're hearing more of them talk about using selling incentives. Although still moderate today, how do you control it? And in prior cycles, have you seen the use of selling incentives after periods where home prices had gone up and then see it resume?","Richard Beckwitt","Hey, Ivy, it's Rick. In any market, good, bad, modest, we have used incentives. The industry has used incentives whether it's closing costs, landscape packages, additional spiffs in the home. It's just part of the normal course of business. Those percentages of incentives change depending on the state of the inventory, the development status in the community, and it's just part of the normal course of business in the industry and in our company. What we identified is that we are -- we have started to use a little bit more. And by a little bit, we're talking maybe 1 point, 1.5 points on selected inventory out there in order to get some activity. And it may be 3 or 4 homes in that community, but not necessarily anything beyond that. It's a price leader. It gets activity out to the job.","Stuart A. Miller","Let me just back up for 1 second, and you talked about the spike in pricing as opposed to pace and the like. But let's now remember that a large part of this recovery has been defined by very, very limited inventory both in existing homes and in new homes and, frankly, in apartments. And so, it's not surprising to see the recovery reflected more in pricing than in pace because you simply can't get the pace where inventories are low and land is very constrained. And that's what we're seeing out in the field. And then, additionally, you look at the smaller builder component of the overall industry, the smaller builders have not been able to come back in the sizable way that they have in prior recoveries. So as I articulated before, I think that price -- the initial movement in price is somewhat of a spike and a reversion to where pricing might have been in a normalized downturn. We'll see more moderate reflection in price as we go forward. And as the market goes through minor gyrations and corrections on the way to a broader recovery, we think that we'll have to use incentives on a select basis. But the limitation of inventory is going to be definitional to where the market goes and how we price going forward.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Okay. That was very helpful. One more question. A big bad bear view out there that I'd like you to dispel if possible is that today the housing starts normalizing given the deficit shelter out there with respect to single-family production predominantly if you can drill in on that. Given where your average home price is and many of the builders focused on more of a move up, more affluent buyer. With today's student loan debt and the young adults that historically have been a first-time home buyer, many believe this demand just isn't there with credit constraints and debt burdens that today's first-time entry market won't be there to support a resumption or a normalized level of new construction predominantly on single family. Can you comment please, Stuart, on that?","Stuart A. Miller","Yes. Look, I think over the past just few weeks, you've started to see some of the banks in the context of a declining refi market -- you've seen some of the banks start to talk about the adjustment of some of their overlays as it relates to mortgage approvals. I think that everyone, from the banking world to the political world, is acutely aware of some of the impediments to the first-time homebuyer market finding its way back into this housing recovery. And I think that solid work and thinking is being brought to bear in the market. It doesn't mean we're seeing broad swings of first-time homebuyers being able to find mortgage approval. But I think, as we look ahead, we're likely to see that open up, open up first at the margins and then revert to normal levels of underwriting standards, which should enable first-time buyers to get back into the market and open up the market in general.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","Will you provide the lots for that entry-level buyer with respect to recognizing whereas today your average home prices are? Strategically, do you feel that that's a market that you'll expand as the market fluctuates or the credit loosens? How should we think about the industry's penetration of that market? Is it fluid?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, I think -- look, we have a diversified offering, a diversified program and have over decades now. We have a sizable first-time buyer component. We'll continue to focus on that part of the market as opportunity opens up. And we'll remain focused on gross margins as well. I guess the question is, does that mean that as you average in first-time buyers, does average sales price start to decline somewhat as a matter of averaging and I guess we'll have to wait and see how big a component it is. But remember, we are bottom-line return-on-capital-focused. And so, where opportunity presents itself, we'll be focusing on our operating margin first and foremost.","Operator","The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So there's been a lot of talk on incentives. I think you guys obviously did a good job, better than we were fearing actually in the quarter on incentives actually coming down. But I guess, in general, you've talked about stepping up the incentive activity a little bit here. Can you give us a sense for what the response has been so far on the part of buyers to this very selective increasing of incentives on standing inventory?","Stuart A. Miller","Let me have Jon and then Rick take that.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","I think you can see, by the fact that we have very little standing inventory, that we have used those selective incentives very carefully and very effectively. And they are a lever that each of our divisions exercises community by community, home by home to make sure we're accomplishing that goal. But I think we feel very comfortable that we're -- we have the right amount to move the inventory that we want to make sure we move. So as we get to month end and quarter end, we're in a very similar position that we're in now.","Richard Beckwitt","Yes. Steve, as you look at the operation of the business, the incentives for the consumer haven't really moved the needle per se. It's really a way for us to generate activity from the brokerage community, and it's a traffic generator. When people come out to the communities, they still find sentimental value. And whether there is an additional 1%, 0.5%, 2%, it's not what is impacting the investment decision.","Stuart A. Miller","Just let me add as a third thought here. In the context of sticker shock, everybody wants a deal, everybody wants to feel that they've lost a little bit and they're getting a little bit back. So it's just an ignition point right now to just keep the market kind of attentive in the context of a time when pricing moved on people.","Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. That's very helpful. Another question that I had -- I guess a second question, sort of a broader question about your opportunities that you see currently in the land market and for your company generally. You've talked about the fact that you're stepping up and you've been very active on the land purchasing side. We can see that in the numbers that you've provided, much higher levels than relative to your burn rate, if you will, than is -- would be considered sustainable, and that I would say almost double what would be considered sustainable. So clearly, there's a cyclical component to what you're pursuing. But you've also talked about shortages in the land market more broadly. That struck me as being also somewhat cyclical and, therefore, somewhat temporary. And I'm curious as to whether you can comment on how much longer you think the land market is going to be in its current severely constrained state so that it would justify your accelerated level of land purchases. We're talking 2 years, 3 years? Do you think this is somewhat systemic? If you could just give us some sense of that, that would be great.","Stuart A. Miller","Okay. You're clearly noting that we've remained an aggressive purchaser of land. As we've noted, this started a number of years ago. We were early to the land purchasing program, and we've maintained that early position -- the properties that we're closing on in large dollar amounts today, the properties that we've contracted for at a much earlier stage. We remain focused on the land side of the business. The land market is constrained, and we would rather be buying early rather than late. We have a 3- to 5-year time horizon on this recovery. We've articulated that, and that defines and informs a good portion of our strategy. To your question about how long will the land market remain constrained, of course, I can't answer that definitively, but it's been -- our view has been formed by the fact that like the smaller homebuilders, the land developer business has had difficulty gaining access to capital except through opportunity-type funds where the cost of capital is rather steep. And so, this acts as its own constraint to the expansion of the supply of land inventory in the marketplace. So at least, for the foreseeable future, until capital markets find a way and with non-opportunistic capital to open up to land developers, we think that land continues to remain constrained and, therefore, constrain inventories overall.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Let me just add one more thought to Stuart's comment is that compared to the last cycle, the environmental, in an entitlement situation, the conditions are much stricter than they were last cycle. So that's going to add to the capital situation land developers face, and I think continue to have a slightly more constrained land environment as we move forward.","Richard Beckwitt","And, Steve, I guess, the final point is, strategically, assuming that there is a new level of development -- third-party development activity coming on stream 2 years, 3 years out, it really plays strategically with how we've invested our capital because we have the ability to supplement our core purchases with incremental immediate delivery opportunities as the market unfolds and starts to continue to grow. And we think that it's consistent with what our overall strategy has been from the get-go.","Operator","The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani, KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick one on your average sales price. Given the average order price, do you expect the average sales price on deliveries in the fourth quarter to be in the $300,000 range?","Stuart A. Miller","Yes. Jade, if you look at our backlog average sales price, it always runs a little bit higher than what we actually deliver because the larger homes sit in backlog a little bit longer. So we would expect there to be a slight increase in the average sales price going into the fourth quarter.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just on Rialto. I think you mentioned the balance sheet is underlevered with the FDIC debt having been fully defeased. Can you talk about options to add leverage? And on Rialto Mortgage Finance, when do you think that the CMBS loan conduit originations would commence in full and start contributing to earnings?","Stuart A. Miller","Yes. Well, look, I think that we have created a terrific optionality in our subsidiary operations. And clearly, that's one point of access to capital that we have in our arsenal. Rialto is really well situated today, having defeased the FDIC debt, with a very strong balance sheet. It's positioned as a stand-alone enterprise that is separately reported. We have all of the levers available to us.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Available for the addition of leverage?","Stuart A. Miller","Leveraged equity -- we've really maintained maximum flexibility in terms of -- by segmenting the business. And as we've grown the business in an unlevered way, we've just afforded ourselves maximum flexibility to go in a number of different directions.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And the loan conduit, do you think that is something that would contribute to earnings in 2014?","Stuart A. Miller","As I noted in my remarks, we have brought on an exceptional team in that space. It is -- they've been working hard getting positioned. While we haven't projected profitability, we think that we're well positioned for profitability in 2014.","Operator","The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut at JPMorgan Chase.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question I had was on sales pace. So far this year, you've been doing plus or minus 3 to 4 a month on average. And as far as my understanding, generally, builders will typically look for, depending on the market, et cetera, 4 per month is a pretty good yardstick, maybe sometimes a little more depending on the ASP and the density. Is there something that you're comfortable with at this stage in the cycle? And as we get more towards, let's say, the middle part of the cycle, would you see that sales pace change at all materially?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, listen, absorption rates are a cyclical phenomenon. I think that if you look at our absorption rate for this quarter, it was somewhere around 3.2%. If you look at last quarter, the spring selling season, we were closer to 4%. And sales pace moves around a little bit, as you go through the seasonality of the year. So I think we're comfortable with where our sales pace has been, and we feel that, again, the market continues to be pretty solid.","Richard Beckwitt","The other thing I'd like to add to that, Michael, is as we purchase communities and underwrite communities with various absorption paces depending on the type of asset that we're buying, and they range from sort of higher end, more affluent type of opportunities where maybe we're looking at an absorption pace of 1.5% to 2% because the operating margins on those closings are so significant, and it justifies the investment of capital. Then there are some communities that we're projecting 4, 5, 6, 7 because it's more of a volume-oriented opportunity. And what skews some of the pace that you see quarter-to-quarter is the mix of deliveries that we're closing from the communities that we have across the country.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, I understand and I appreciate that. It's kind of why I gave a range of 3 to 4 and understanding seasonality. I guess I was just thinking more from the perspective that there are other builders, let's say, that have kind of put sales pace out there and said, \"Hey, you know, relative to the early 2000s, late 1990s, overall, we're still 25%, 30%, even off of our what we consider a normalized sales pace with all those factors considered.\" I was just wondering if that's a statement that applies to you or that, again, given the mix and everything else, that the sales pace that you're currently seeing is something that you would expect either more in the middle of the cycle or maybe that's just not the case for you that you're more or less hitting what you were hoping to hit as the communities are coming through?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, I can tell you that we're exceeding underwriting with regards to pace for the most part. That on a historical basis, absorptions have been higher at various points of cycles and we run the business to maximize the operating margin in the individual communities.","Stuart A. Miller","I would just add that we manage our pace also to match our construction pace. And again, we've mentioned a few times about our low level of spec homes. We really don't want to sell at a faster pace than we're constructing homes. And that, of course, is somewhat controlled by our community count and the land supply that we've spoken about.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, I appreciate. That's helpful. I guess, second question just on equity earnings in Rialto, the $10 million of profit in the equity earnings line, I guess, from some additional sales of homesites from El Toro, when you reported the profit from El Toro last quarter, I believe then you said that you would be releasing the next phase somewhere over the -- in mid '14. Just thinking about that, going forward, is that something that, the $10 million or this additional flow of lot sales, is that something that we should expect to be a little bit more regular? And also -- I'm sorry to kind of bring in another question. But on Rialto, now that you've defeased the debt, should we expect a different flow of earnings from the -- now that the distributions might come in a little bit more on a regular basis?","Bruce E. Gross","Let me answer the first question, Mike. With respect to the joint venture profit, we didn't sell additional homesites than the 726. There was some profit relating to the 726 homesites that were booked in this quarter. We still believe that the next group of homesites at El Toro are about, call it, sometime in 2014. So we didn't elect to sell additional homesites at this point. And then, relative to additional earnings in Rialto, because the debt's defeased, there's nothing there. So that doesn't pair up well relative to the debt being defeased. So as far as earnings go going forward, there'd be no change.","Operator","The next question is coming from Eli Hackel, Goldman Sachs.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions. First, Stuart, you mentioned a little bit more on banks loosening up. Can you just give a little bit more color? It sounded like in the last couple of weeks you noticed a change, have you seen anything related to just them saying, well, QRM is here, refi revenue is down, wanting to make that up? And then, just on the incentives, I know you talked about it a little bit, but is there any region or price point that was more prevalent in?","Stuart A. Miller","Bruce, why don't you go ahead? I think as it relates to the banks, the banks have made their own announcements.","Bruce E. Gross","Yes. I'm sorry. Could you just repeat that first part, Eli?","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. Just in the beginning of some prepared remarks and some questions, just from banks maybe potentially loosening up a little bit more. You said you noticed some signs of that. I just was hoping for a little bit more color there, and then sort of how fast could that -- maybe it speeds up, but the refi revenue is down 50% or 60%. I just wanted your thoughts there.","Bruce E. Gross","Yes, sure. So what we did here with some of the major banks is that FICO scores have been announced that they've been reduced into the low 600 range. And then, additionally, in several states, the down payment requirement has come down to as low as 5%, and that is something that we believe is being implemented over the next month. So you're starting to see some benefit there. And in addition to that, you're also seeing that there's more mortgage insurance that's being used. In this quarter, over 1\/3 of our conventional buyers had down payments less than 20%. And down payment is the biggest issue for our buyers typically. So we think that's very helpful for what's already changed and what's coming down the pike over the next month or so from the banks. So as refinance volume, as you mentioned, continues to trail off, that's a big component of bank earnings as we all know, and you're seeing the layoffs out there. And so, the tendency would be we would expect for a continuing easing with some of the overlays that they've had in place. So we look at that as real positive going forward.","Stuart A. Miller","But I think you've actually seen JPMorgan and Wells make announcements that their underwriting standards are starting to moderate, especially as that refi business has bled off.","Bruce E. Gross","Right.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then, just on incentives, just if they were concentrated in a region or price point?","Stuart A. Miller","The incentives have been pretty widespread -- I mean, across the country and have been in select communities, where they might have been needed as a re-spark.","Operator","The next question is coming from Ken Zener, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So your guys' delivery can come through more communities or greater sales pace. If the sales pace is going to follow vagaries of the market, and it seems where it is seasonal versus cyclical right now. Can you -- with all your land in hand, can you give us -- or comment on '14's expected community count -- growth rate right now?","Bruce E. Gross","We haven't laid that out at this point, Ken. That's -- we're intending to give an update into 2014 on our next conference call, which we're expecting to be about the 3rd week of December.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, the second point. With your closing guidance suggesting mid-90% backlog turn, it obviously indicates quite a bit of pre-built homes already in inventory. So does that -- 2 questions here, does that approach -- is that more common in less land-constrained areas, or are you actually using that kind of pre-built but not sold on the price as the way to kind of leverage price gains, kind of call options for your margins. What's in that, is there -- it's an obvious margin spread between your pre-sold homes as opposed to ones you started building and then sold them?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, on the inventory side, I think we've consistently said over time that we have a spec program where we try to maintain 1 to 2 per community across the country in every community. We have some that are starting construction, some of which is presold, some of which is a speculative unsold home. And what we do is, on each community -- at each community, we measure pace and price to figure out what our start program would be. And we haven't really adjusted that program in the market over the last several quarters, pretty consistent with what we've been doing.","Stuart A. Miller","Right. And with that, why don't we make this -- the next one the last question?","Operator","And our last question is coming from Susan Maklari of UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question is on the cancellation rate. Can you give us a little more detail into what caused the sequential increase that we saw? And then, are you comfortable with the current level? Or how should we think about the potential trends in that going forward?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, our cancellation rate has really been pretty modest. If you look historically, cancellation rates are generally around 20% and maybe even trending a little bit higher. We've always articulated and felt that not having that kind of level of cancellation rate means that our sales folks just aren't pushing or working hard enough. You're going to have a certain number of buyers that, for one reason or another, don't go forward. So our cancellation rate, at least by historical norms, is still relatively low. We're in the 18% range right now. So I wouldn't ascribe too much importance to that cancellation rate for the fluctuations around that range. Bruce, would you add to that?","Bruce E. Gross","No, no, I agree. I think you said it well. We've always said that normalized cancellation rate is around 20%. And when there was a buildup of inventory and we needed to monetize inventory in the downturn, it got up to much higher levels. But we would like to see the can rate be at a healthy level, closer to that 20% range, give or take a little bit.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Perfect. And then, just one last question. You spoke to the fact that you're still able to offset the input cost increases that you're seeing with the home price appreciation that you're getting. If we get to a point where the home price depreciation falls somewhat from what we're seeing, can you talk about maybe potentially some of the things you can do to help offset those input prices and continue to maintain somewhat the margins that you're seeing now?","Bruce E. Gross","Okay. So as input prices are changing, again, we've been offsetting them with our price increases and with sales incentives coming down. And keeping in mind that our direct costs are 40% to 45% of the sales price, so they would have to go up twice as fast as any net benefit between the sales price improvement or the sales incentives coming down. So that's the main item that we see offsetting these costs as we go forward.","Stuart A. Miller","But additionally, we are primarily focused on our operating margin. And as our volumes continue to improve and as our efficiency continues to improve, we think that the net bottom line is also improving even as sales price starts to slow a little bit.","All right. So we'll end it there. We would like to thank everybody for joining us for our third quarter update and look forward to reporting the fourth quarter. As Bruce said earlier, it will be the 3rd week of December, and we look forward to telling you more about the progress of the market and our company. Thank you.","Operator","This will conclude today's conference.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart Miller","Great. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. And I am here this morning joined by an assorted group of our management team, including Bruce, of course, our Chief Financial Officer; Rick Beckwitt our President; and Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto; and some others. But those will be the primary participants. I am going to briefly give some remarks and then Bruce will jump in with some additional detail and then we will open up to Q&A. And as usual, I would like to request that we can get as many questions as possible in our hour that you limit yourself to one question and just one follow-up please.","So, great. Let me go ahead and begin and say that our third quarter 2016 results reflect yet another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We have consistently believed that we are in a slow steady, though sometimes choppy, housing market recovery, and we have crafted our operating strategies specifically to position us well to grow steadily and consistently and to act opportunistically in these market conditions. As we have noted over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that continued to grow over the past years. This deficit is particularly focused on the first time homebuyer segment of the market, and this part of the market was rather late to begin its slow and steady improvement as well.","While questions have been raised as to the real normalized levels of production that are required to serve the growing U.S. population, we continue to believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of the American household growth that is now normalizing. Additional questions have been raised as the effect of an increase in interest rates relative to the recovery for first time homebuyers segment. We believe that there continues to be a growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than others. And this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady, sometimes erratic market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rate, and this goes for both first-time and move-up purchasers.","With that said, it\u2019s important to note that the housing market is not really a national market, but instead it\u2019s a large number of very local markets each with different dynamics that are averaged together \u2013 that generate some sometimes quirky results and data. While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, wage growth, and general consumer confidence are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We continue to expect that demand will build and come to market over the next years and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand while the mortgage market and higher rents continue to limit that demand.","We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady, positive homebuilding market and will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry. These have been our consistent guiding views over the past years and we have mapped our operating strategy around these views. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of these segments.","Now, against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence. Our results reflect execution of our operating strategy as our new home orders increased 8% year-over-year while community count grew 3%, and our average home price grew 3% to approximately $362,000. Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins, and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.2% for the third quarter. This focus has helped improve our balance sheet as well with our net homebuilding debt to total cap coming in at just below 40% with further improvement expected in the fourth quarter.","As we have noticed \u2013 as we have noted in past conference calls, we have adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive. We have noted three components of our core homebuilding strategy. One, soft pivot; two, target lower growth rate; and three, focus on SG&A. We have talked consistently and extensively about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years away from LEN\u2019s heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages in the recovery. We are now targeting high-quality A location land acquisitions with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Additionally, we have ramped up our first-time homebuyer offering organically with lower land cost as that segment of the market continues to recover.","Second, we have noted in the past quarterly conference calls that given the now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in orders to concurrently grow bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We have moderated our top line growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% at 10% range as we have redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin.","Third, with less pressure on top line growth, we have intensified management focus and driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra of What We can Measure, We Can Change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operations. I noted an example last quarter and highlighted that we have been reducing customer acquisition costs through our digital marketing initiatives.","We have expanded our focus to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expenses in those areas as well. It is noteworthy that this quarter\u2019s SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest third quarter SG&A in our company\u2019s history. Our homebuilding operations are becoming extremely efficient operating machines. With demand rowing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our three-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for steady growth and as well the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically.","Moving on, our financial services group is continuing to expand and improve and has had an outstanding second quarter as well. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we have also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic refi market, as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. These sidecar opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we have moved through 2016 and that\u2019s reflected in our operating earnings of $53.2 million, up 35% over last year.","Our strategy for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar homebuilding business, but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments. Next, our multifamily platform continues to develop as the leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The third quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to complement our for-sale homebuilding operations. With the home ownership rate continuing its decline, now dropping just below 63%, many new households have either been forced or are inclined to rent rather than purchase and have focused on \u2013 and we have focused on building well located rental communities to address this market opportunity.","First-time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While the growing percentage of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared towards first-time purchasers, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well. As we have continued to expand our national footprint, we have matured and evolved from a merchant build program, which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase has worked extremely well, as reflected in the sales of properties we have recorded to-date and the additional sales that will close in the fourth quarter as well. Through those sales, we have proven our ability to purchase, to design, build, stabilize and sell quite profitably a number of our communities at an increasing level of profitability.","Having proven the concept, we have now built or added to \u2013 or added a build-to-core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have currently a solid $2 billion for our build-to-core platform, which will become a long-term cash flowing \u2013 cash producing, fee generating value creation machine. While multifamily production has generally normalized and some have expressed concerns about over building in some markets, nationally, more rental product is going to continue to be needed to fill the national production deficit. And we are very well positioned to continue to be very careful in site selection while we fill this need and grow our multifamily platform. Our now $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well timed, as rental rates have climbed to exceed our original underwriting and vacancies remained at very low levels.","Next, our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the third quarter as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of 2016. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve and RMF completed \u2013 Rialto Mortgage Finance completed its 30th and 31st securitization transaction with gross margins ranging from 5.4% to 5.7% and with almost $500 million of RMF originated loans. Rialto Mortgage Finance maintained its position as one of the largest non-bank CMBS loan originators. With the rebound in the market, the securitization transactions occurring this quarter, generated the single largest contribution of loans Rialto Mortgage Finance has ever made and also the largest net margin for a single transition \u2013 transaction in our history. This brings our total to almost $6 billion of securitized loans since RMF\u2019s inception.","On the asset management front, we also previously announced the first closing of commitments of our third fund. And although we can\u2019t really say anything more as we are still in the market, this fund will complement our other opportunistic fund with readily available capital to invest as we have approximately $920 million of investor equity dedicated to mezzanine and transitional lending in those other funds. Our first two flagship opportunity funds have both been top quartile performers. Fund one became fully invested in early 2013 and we now distributed 135% of investors\u2019 original capital from income and monetization. And with the distribution through this quarter, Rialto now has already realized 2x its original best investment with a lot more to go. We expect to begin to report, promote on this first fund in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our fund and asset management business shows improved profitability over last year\u2019s second \u2013 last year\u2019s third quarter and we expect this trend to continue.","Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short-term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycle. The dysfunction that we saw earlier this year in the financial market, along with new risk retention rules and banking regulations, are beginning to work to the benefit of Rialto\u2019s core competent and CMBS and financial products and we have the capital available to invest.","Finally, FivePoint is now a self sufficient standalone company that is a premier strategic large scale community builder. As we stated in our last quarterly conference call, we contributed and exchanged our interest in three strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity. This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint\u2019s evolution as the strategic developer and manager of large scale master planned communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar\u2019s strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base as it liberates FivePoint to act independently, raise capital and utilize its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically. FivePoint will operate very independently with a self contained management team under the leadership of Emil Haddad, who many of you know. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future for this one of a kind leader in community development.","So in summary, overall let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our third quarter results and our overall progress this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that have defined our various business segments continue to work very well to position us for continued performance and for future growth. As I have said many times before, we believe very confidently that we have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future. Now let me turn it over to Bruce.","Bruce Gross","Thanks Stuart and good morning. I will provide some more color on our businesses and conclude with an update on our 2016 goals. Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the third quarter, driven by a 7% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $362,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.6%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year\u2019s gross margin percentage was 24.1%. The gross margins decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs.","Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, with the largest increase coming from the Houston segment, particularly with higher price communities. Gross margin percents were once again highest in the East region. Direct construction costs have increased moderately compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2.5% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot. This was driven entirely by labor offset by a slight decrease in material costs. As Stuart mentioned, SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved \u2013 it improved by 60 basis points as we were successful gaining operating leverage by growing volume organically in existing homebuilding divisions and from the benefits of our focus on digital marketing.","Other income was $30.9 million primarily due to a gain of $8.7 million on the sale of a clubhouse, which we originally were projecting to close in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we had $17 million of management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures. Equity in large from unconsolidated entities was $18 million, which included our share of the loss related to the $17 million that I just mentioned in other income and our share of net operating losses and one-time charges from the newly created FivePoint entity in combination that Stuart mentioned.","This quarter, we opened 66 new communities and ended the quarter with 694 net active communities. Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at 3.4 sales per community per month versus 3.2 in prior year\u2019s quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 16% in the third quarter. And we purchased approximately 5,400 home sites totaling $264 million versus $267 million in the prior year\u2019s quarter. These numbers align with our soft pivot strategy where we are focused on buying shorter duration land. Our home sites owned and controlled now total 159,000 home sites, of which 129,000 are owned and 30,000 are controlled. We brought down our completed unsold homes during the quarter. It came down 19% sequentially to 973 homes.","Turning to financial services, they had strong results this quarter with operating earnings of $53.2 million compared to $39.4 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income increased to $38.3 million from $31.4 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment. Mortgage originations increased to $2.6 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year as a result of a focused effort to capitalize on the low mortgage rates in the third quarter, we achieved a 56% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year.","The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers remains consistent with the prior year at 82% capture rate. And our title company also had a strong quarter. Their profits increased to $15 million from $8.2 million in the prior year and that was also primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume in the current year. Additionally, they had a great focus on operational efficiencies driving additional bottom line profit.","Turning to Rialto, this segment produced operating earnings of $5.9 million compared to $9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interest. The investment management business contributed $27.6 million of earnings, which include $6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $21.6 million of management fees and other. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $491 million of commercial loans into two securitizations resulting in earnings of $27.2 million compared with $519 million and $14.2 million in the prior year respectively. And that\u2019s before their G&A expense.","The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the net margins. This year was 5.4% in the third quarter versus last year\u2019s third quarter at 3.1% net margin. Our direct investments had a loss of $5.6 million during the quarter. And Rialto G&A and other expenses were $36.2 million for the quarter and interest expense, excluding the warehouse lines, was $7.1 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $133 million of cash.","The multifamily segment delivered a $2.6 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment\u2019s $8 million share of a gain from the sale of an operating property, as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 8 completed and operating properties and 37 under construction, 10 of which are in lease up, totaling over 11,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $3.2 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion and over 20,000 apartments.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 31.1% compared to 30% in the prior year\u2019s period. The rate is lower than expected for this quarter as a result of our continued efforts to maximize the new home energy efficiency credit, which was extended into 2016. We will continue to focus on maximizing this energy credit. And therefore, we believe the tax rate for the fourth quarter will also be lower than previously expected. We believe that will be a range of 33% to 34%.","Our balance sheet is strong. Our operating strategies had focused on driving cash flow generation. And this quarter, we generated positive operating cash flow. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $568 million of homebuilding cash and $125 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which during the quarter was increased to $1.8 billion. Our leverage improved by 650 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 39.9%. We grew stockholders\u2019 equity by 22% to $6.5 billion and our book value per share increased to $28.73 per share. During the quarter, we early converted an additional $175 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes. And for the year, we have now converted a total of $243 million of those notes. Our next debt maturity matures in June of 2017 and we look forward to retiring $400 million of 12.25% senior notes, which currently cost us $50 million per interest per year.","Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. We are still on track with our 2016 goals with a few refinements for the fourth quarter. First, deliveries are still on track with our original 2016 goal to deliver between 26,500 and 27,000 homes. The fourth quarter is projected to achieve a backlog conversion right at 90%. We expect the average sales price for these deliveries to be between $355,000 and $360,000 per home.","Turning to margins, the gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately 23.25%. And we are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A percentage in the company\u2019s history in 2016 with our fourth quarter expected to see another 50 basis points reduction sequentially below the third quarter\u2019s 9.3%. So, that would bring it around 8.8% for the fourth quarter.","Financial services, our second and third quarter are typically the highest profit quarters for LFS. However, given the continued favorable interest rate environment, we are also increasing our goal for the fourth quarter for this segment to a range of $37 million to $40 million for the quarter. Rialto earnings are projected to be in a range of $5 million to $7 million of profit for the fourth quarter. And multifamily, based on our favorable sale expectations for between 4 and 5 communities for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our multifamily goal to a range of $30 million to $40 million for the fourth quarter. Joint ventures, land sales and the other income, which I will group together, we were successful in accelerating some of the projected fourth quarter land sale and clubhouse transactions into our third quarter. So, we are now updating our projection to this category to $5 million for the fourth quarter.","And then finally with our balance sheet, as we noted, our third quarter net debt to total capital has come down below 40% and we are well on our path to lower leverage. As Stuart mentioned with our operating strategies, our strong projected earnings, our soft pivot strategy and converting the remainder of the 3.25% convertible, which will shift from debt to equity in the fourth quarter, all of this will continue to lead to lower leverage, which has given us a rock solid balance sheet and positions us well for opportunities as we finish out 2016.","Let me now turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Bob Wetenhall","Hi. Thanks for taking the question and good morning. A lot of focus on gross margins, and Stuart has been consistently talking about the soft pivot strategy, and I was hoping, instead of just focusing on this quarter, we could kind of walk through your thinking process on gross margin and profitability in the context of your comments about delivery growth of 7% to 10% annually, it sounds a little bit like you are doing more with less inventory, but you are keeping margins high, I am just trying thinking about the trajectory of how this unfolds, not just today, but more in 2017 and 2018?","Stuart Miller","Okay. So we have been pretty consistent Bob, in saying that we expect our gross margins to be drifting down. We highlighted that at the beginning of this year and as we move through last year as well. But we also focused attention on net operating margin primarily recognizing that as land that was bought at very low prices flow through our system, margins would be higher. As that land dissipated and we ended up with more shorter-term land, our margins would \u2013 our gross margins would drift down. But we felt that as the recovery matured, we would continue to focus on bringing down our growth rate, focusing on efficiencies in our SG&A as we have been articulating and really driving increased earnings through more efficient net operating margin. Let me turn to Rick and Jon and have them weigh in on that.","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. This is Rick. The natural evolution of a soft pivot is that you are starting to take less risk in land. Associated with that risk profile is a margin presence. You are looking for near-term opportunities, quicker turns, so gross margin will naturally come down and IRRs will come up. And so, when we are going less long on some of these positions, it means that you are paying a little bit closer to retail than you were in buying wholesale. The other thing that we have been doing is we really been managing pace in price. A great example of that is notwithstanding the fact that the Houston market is definitely softer, given the turmoil in the energy market. But if you look at our performance there for the last quarter, sales were up by 14%, but our ASP was up by 4%. So in a tough market, we are really trying to maximize the value of the quality assets that we got there and not give the homes away. We certainly could have sold more homes, but we are just really managing it.","Jon Jaffe","Hi Bob, it\u2019s Jon. Just to add on, in addition to the impact we see from the land strategy, we continue to manage in that environment on each community price and pace balance. If you look at for example, California and Florida, this past quarter, we averaged over one sale per week. It\u2019s a really healthy pace and we are doing that in an environment where there isn\u2019t the same kind of pricing power there was a year ago, so all that \u2013 that will drive our net operating margin to maintain a very healthy rate while we see that compression on our gross margin.","Bob Wetenhall","Well, I have got to say, you guys are doing a nice job of striking the balance between price and pace, and thanks for articulating how this unfolds. Maybe as the second question and follow-up, Stuart has made reference to the ancillary businesses starting to mature, and obviously, expectations for multifamily making a much larger contribution in 4Q are becoming visible, and the Rialto business sounds like the promote is going to become much more visible in the second \u2013 in the first half of 2017, can you give us a little bit of a roadmap for thinking about the timing and how you might monetize these assets, it sounds like you\u2019ve had a lot of progress bringing them up the curve, it sounds like they are kind of ripe, how should we be thinking about the game plan as you revert to a pure play homebuilder moving through the cycle? Thanks and good luck.","Stuart Miller","Right. So thanks Bob. Look, we have been very focused on that notion of reversion to pure play. And that\u2019s a story that\u2019s going to play out over the next couple of years. This construct doesn\u2019t change overnight. We have highlighted very clearly that FivePoint is our starting point in all of that. FivePoint, we have seen a consolidation of our interest and unification under a corporate umbrella, where \u2013 which is being overseen by its CEO, Emile Haddad. And FivePoint is positioned to see it evolve into its own independent company managed by its own complement of executives and overseen by its own unique Board of Directors, which parenthetically myself, Rick, and Jon are part of. That\u2019s an example of how we will continue to think about our ancillary businesses move them through the system. The second area is in the apartment area. You are already starting to see a migration through that merchant-build program and towards our build-to-core program, which in many ways is a very separate program. It again, like FivePoint has its own complement of management and that builds a core program as an opportunity for us to build a stream of earnings that is consistent, it\u2019s fee generative, and enables us to realize on the great value that we are creating. Rialto continues to build to be able to be strategic in its alignment for the future, but we don\u2019t have a current path for Rialto that we have articulated. But as Rialto\u2019s asset management and RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance businesses continue to grow, we think that there are tremendous opportunities for that company to combine to IPO to do a variety of things as we really start to focus on the core homebuilding business.","Rick Beckwitt","And it\u2019s Rick, Bob. One sort of data point is if you look at Q4, we are guiding to an increase between $10 million and $15 million just for the multifamily growth. So I think you will start to see a more consistent level of big nominal profitability for quarter as we build through the merchant build program and get into that cash recurring fee generating core program. So that will become very visible.","Stuart Miller","Okay, next question.","Operator","Next question is from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Your line now is open.","Ivy Zelman","Thank you and good morning guys, good quarter, 15 in a row meeting expectations. I guess what I would like to address is if I could with all of you is sort of the elephant in the room right, the investment community is very focused on looking at compression of gross margins, which we appreciate that, that\u2019s sort of a natural progression of one of the gap you guys have close between retail versus the stress. And Stuart, I think you have done a great job in articulating that message for quite some time, but the big concern is that you are not be able to grow operating earnings in homebuilding as margins, even with the improvement in SG&A dropped down, your EBIT margin, operating margin from homebuilding is down year-over-year, although it\u2019s amongst the highest of the sector. And I think what we would love to hear, this cycle is different in many ways and when you look at the multi-year outlook, can you continue to drive improvements in ROE, utilizing the cash flow you are generating to drive shareholder value and give investors on the line more confidence that there is growth and probably better than S&P and alternative, with the stock down I think it\u2019s very near-term focus on gross margins, which they are not seeing the bigger picture, so if you can elaborate sort of your vision and how do you generate better cash flows through the strategy that will ultimately drive returns?","Stuart Miller","Okay. So that\u2019s a great question. And I think it is on a lot of people\u2019s minds. Our view has been that our gross margins will continue to drift downwards. I think if you look at the average of the industry, if you look at what\u2019s normalized gross margin in the industry, you are probably looking at 21%, 22%. And over time, we will probably drift in that direction. The industry average might even be lower than that. But I would say a few things. We have a lot of guns in our arsenal. We have been very focused on operational efficiency. We are not focusing on stretching growth in an environment that just isn\u2019t giving it easily. Land is expensive. Land is hard to come by. People are expensive and hard to come by. It\u2019s hard to grow operations efficiently and effectively at an accelerated rate in a market where land and labor is really constrained. And so we have chosen to focus on operational efficiencies as a mechanism for driving profitability going forward. And we have been consistently articulating look at the net operating margin where we will find much more stability and the opportunity to drive profitability going forward from our core business. But with that said, we have also articulated other strategies. Look at our financial services group, we have been diversifying that group, not only is it growing alongside of our core homebuilding business, it\u2019s growing outside of that homebuilding operation and we are finding additional earnings by leveraging that part of our business. Look at Rialto, look at our multifamily effort, look at our ancillaries and you start to see that there are real growth components that derive from a core homebuilding operation that\u2019s operating well and these ancillary businesses that are operating cooperatively.","Rick Beckwitt","And Ivy, this is Rick again. It\u2019s really that balance of case and price again. If we wanted to grow volume at a much higher clip, we could certainly enter into contract for some additional communities that are at the normalized margins that the rest of the builders are building at. And we have chosen up through this point to keep an above industry margin even though it\u2019s been drifting somewhat downward. And if you go back and you look at this business over multiple cycles, multiple time points, if you are somewhere around 20% growth you are doing a pretty good job. We have just chosen to be north of that and we will continue to be north of where that normalized curve is.","Ivy Zelman","That\u2019s really helpful. But I think to just take it one step further, if you think about the cash flow that assuming that you will generate strong cash flows and knowing investors are looking for companies that can reinvest that cash flow to drive shareholder value beyond the ancillary businesses that are maturing and should drive returns, would you consider share buyback and other alternatives or do you want the maturation process of the ancillary businesses to drive the returns and should we expect returns to continue to move on an upward trajectory even if homebuilding might be pivoting, can you still grow the absolute operating income of homebuilding over the strategy you have deployed?","Stuart Miller","No, look, as I said, we have a lot of guns in our arsenal and our ancillary businesses are a very positive part of that construct, but we have continued to focus everyone\u2019s attention on the core. And we think we can continue to drive the core forward. Yes, there are opportunities to either buyback stock or through acquisition to expand our platform and we hold both of those opportunities open to ourselves. We are generating the cash where we can go down either route and the opportunities out there to us given our current position are very strong.","Ivy Zelman","Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Stuart Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I just wanted to kind of circle back to the ancillary businesses and obviously appreciate all the detail and it\u2019s exciting to see how those are maturing over time. Just wanted to try and get a sense, Stuart, as you have talked to the different three core businesses, Rialto, LMC and\/or LMF and FivePoint, I know FivePoint is taking different twist and turns in terms of its maturation and future in the last 18 months. And so may be that\u2019s a little harder to kind of pinpoint or get a sense of when that might kind of become its own separate entity, separate from Lennar that is on a more complete basis. But perhaps, you could talk to Rialto and LMC, I am sorry, LMF, how do you think about those businesses in terms of being a part of the broader Lennar family over the next 2 or 3 years. Obviously, Rialto itself is taking a lot of strides, is that something that might \u2013 that you are looking for an exit over the next year to some early for multifamily and now that, that\u2019s closer to more of a recurring revenue streams that\u2019s something that you just see kind of an ongoing part of the business from a broader corporate umbrella sense or could this be, are you still weighing other options for that business as well?","Stuart Miller","Well, okay, so as it relates to Rialto \u2013 well, I am sorry, let me start with FivePoint. As it relates to FivePoint, which where you started might \u2013 FivePoint trajectory has been very consistent and very positive. The properties in FivePoint had been moving through their system and the consolidation of FivePoint\u2019s ownership under one umbrella is a consistent theme. What hasn\u2019t been consistent on market conditions, we had embarked on a program to launch an IPO, which under good market conditions would have gone off by now. So, the market is the market, we can\u2019t do much to change that, but the underlying operations of FivePoint are spectacular. As it relates to LMC, our multifamily platform, I think that there is a very strong case to be made that, that business really is almost part of the core. It has been a part of our strategy for dealing with the first-time homebuyer segment, which has been forced or inclined to rent rather than to purchase because of market conditions or because of appetites. And in fact, that strategy has worked out quite well for us and might be a very compatible program under the core umbrella. So, we are not \u2013 we are certainly not targeting right now a spin-off or some other kind of program relative to that segment and we will have to see over time. As it relates to Rialto, Rialto was built with the understanding that it would be synergistic to our \u2013 to the growth of our core business and it was in fact through the downturn. We have grown Rialto into a business that looks an awful lot like the business that we have spun-off back in 1997 under the name Eleanor. And it continues to grow along those lines. Now, there has been choppiness in the capital markets. There are questions around the regulatory environment. We think that each of these things work to our benefit. And as we continue to grow the platform, we want to let these things resolved themselves before we designed and put forth an exit strategy, but ultimately, Rialto will standalone.","Rick Beckwitt","Let me just add one thing on the multifamily group is given that we have pivoted to a built-to-core program, we essentially had the business that is self-funded to build out about $4 billion to $4.5 billion of apartment communities on a development cost base. When that\u2019s done, it will be a portfolio that\u2019s cash producing that we as a company will have tremendous optionality as to what we do with it. If it makes sense keeping in size and that creates the most shareholder value, we will keep it inside if it makes sense to do something outside of that, but when it gets to that point where it\u2019s constantly turning our cash, there is going to be a lot of different things that we can do.","Michael Rehaut","Thank you. I appreciate that. It all makes sense. I guess, just secondly and Stuart, you referenced this, in terms of Lennar multifamily with the first-time and rent versus owned. How do you think about that kind of going back to \u2013 shifting back to your core homebuilding operations for a moment, you had a little bit of sales pace growth year-over-year in the quarter. And I think that\u2019s consistent with the first half. Actually, it\u2019s a little stronger than the first half on a year-over-year basis, the absorption \u2013 year-over-year absorption growth. Is first-time starting to play a little bit of a larger role there. And as you think about the 7% to 10% growth going forward, would you still expect there to be driven by perhaps roughly equally community count growth and absorption pace?","Rick Beckwitt","Well, with regard to the first time buyer business, as Stuart said in his quote, we have ramped up that business. If you look at where we stood at the end of the quarter, about 40% of our communities across the U.S. are first time buyer. And we haven\u2019t highlighted that. We have been behind the scenes, increasing our positions in the core markets that are really geared to that first time buyer. And you will continue to see that play out over the next couple of years. Jon, do you want to talk about the growth?","Jon Jaffe","I think we are seeing in all of our markets even the ones that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily associate with first time buyers ability through higher density our product strategies to increase our exposure to that market as that market improves. So I think you will see a ramp up, it\u2019s not only in the natural place like Texas, but you will see in the California markets, in Nevada and Florida as well.","Michael Rehaut","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Your line now is open.","Stephen East","Thank you. Good morning guys. Stuart, can you talk a little bit more, as you do your soft pivot, which you have talked about for a few years now and it\u2019s executing, but as we move forward, it sounds like that\u2019s gaining a little momentum, so I am trying to understand what happens to your land supply as you move forward, are you going to shrink even though you are growing 7% to 10%, what\u2019s that imply for your cash flow generation as you move through it and I will stop there for now?","Stuart Miller","Yes. So that\u2019s exactly the strategy Steve, is our land supply relative to our production should be moderating. Our cash flow should be accelerating and we should continue to be enhancing our balance sheet. And as I have articulated in my remarks, our balance sheet has been improving. We are starting to see that soft pivot reflect. We are buying less land relative to the amount of production that we are generating. And of course, that\u2019s been accelerating by slowing the growth pace, we are increasing the cash flow. We have seen our balance sheet improve and it will continue to improve as we go into the fourth quarter. I think Bruce highlighted that we will be reducing our rather expensive debt in June of 2017. All of these are balance sheet enhancements. And they enable us to have an awful lot of options in terms of being able to access capital and deploy capital either in the form of returning capital to shareholders, as was asked earlier or in the form of finding unique opportunities to grow our business in strategic ways. And of course, you know that we look at all of those as real opportunities within the company. So it\u2019s very much been a part of the strategy to get to exactly the place that we are at right now.","Stephen East","Okay. And do you, as a part of that, two quick follow-ons to that and then a different question, do you accelerate your land sales, you had a little bit higher than what we expected this quarter, so is that a part of the plan also to just monetize in a different way than putting a house on it. And this last cycle, you all were by far the earliest in taking advantage. And so as you sit here taking advantage of the market, as you sit here and evaluate between share repurchases and being patient in building cash on the balance sheet to take advantage of that, can you tell me sort of what the key drivers of your thought process might be in that evaluation. And then totally different, your incentives creeped up, just what\u2019s going on there, what\u2019s driving it, is this just sort of the new, lay of the land, if you will or was there something going on?","Stuart Miller","Okay. So that\u2019s a compound question. You get credit for asking three in one. But Rick do you want to go?","Jon Jaffe","It\u2019s Jon. On land sales Steve, those are as always with our company opportunistic. Our soft pivot strategy is much more about the acquisition side than the disposition. And we will look at opportunities where we map a longer land position and how we care that down to better fit our soft pivot strategy. But the core principle there is how we approach shorter term acquisitions. With respect to incentives, as Bruce highlighted in his comments, that really was driven for a company by what\u2019s going on in Houston. As you look across our marketplace as I would say incentives maintain a very stable level. We don\u2019t see sort of the norm being increase incentives at all.","Rick Beckwitt","Okay. One clarification, because I think as a company across the nation, we are going through soft pivot. But that does not mean that we won\u2019t to take advantage of excellent Class A assets, well located, good values, good strategic fit even if there are longer runway. And it\u2019s the overall totality of the blend of the long and the short that has consistently made us successful in differentiate us as a company.","Stuart Miller","Yes. And look, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a great point that Rick makes. It\u2019s a very important clarification. We are out there buying land and we are buying it. We are taking that core competence that we have got and we are buying strategically. As we move into and accelerate our position, relative to certain markets, relative to the first time homebuyer, we do it rather aggressively. Soft pivot is a way of thinking and it\u2019s recognizing that we might buy a 5-year piece of land or a 7-year piece of land, but we might carve off half of it or a third of it in a land sale so that we are not holding it on our books. If you look at our land spend, we are spending significant dollars preparing for our future and ensuring that we are growing consistently. And we do it as well as better than anybody in the industry. So you can expect that we are still a land player and that there will be some additional land sales because of the way that we are thinking about the whole period. But we are still very active in the market.","Stephen East","Got it. Do you feel comfortable building out cash and holding on your balance sheet waiting for a similar opportunity as you got in \u201809 and \u201810, etcetera, or what\u2019s your thought process on evaluating that versus going ahead and spending on a share repurchase type program?","Stuart Miller","I think that we are very disciplined in our approach and the accumulation of cash is not going to burn a hole in the bottom of our pocket. We are stuck to a strategy. Thus far, we are going to stick to it as we go forward unless we believe that there is a different strategy that is significantly better. And we haven\u2019t come to that yet given the market conditions, given the maturity of the cycle, we feel very comfortable with the position that we are in and we are going to be able to drive consistent growth and be positioned for opportunity.","Stephen East","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Your line now is open.","Stuart Miller","Good morning Steve.","Stephen Kim","Good morning. Thanks very much guys for taking the question. I guess I wanted to follow-on to the comment you made about targeting first time buyers that\u2019s maybe a little bit more density and some innovation on the product side, obviously you guys have been pretty much industry leaders, I would say over the last decade in terms of product innovation, so we don\u2019t doubt that you have the ability to come up with what\u2019s next in terms of the product, however, mindful that you already own about 5 years worth of lots give or take, but that sometimes permitting restrictions, make it difficult to sort of take yesterday\u2019s land and put tomorrow\u2019s product on it in some places, can you help us understand how much future land spend do you think is needed to accommodate the innovation, the kind of product you are going to be initiating over the next or launching over the course of the next couple of years, how much of that is going to be have to be from future land spend versus what you already own today. And I am thinking particularly if you can maybe say 2 years from now, how much of the active land base at that time is already owned by you today?","Stuart Miller","I would say that most of that is really owned by us now. On a net-net basis, that\u2019s going to be \u2013 will basically be flat on an inventory level.","Stephen Kim","In dollars, you mean?","Stuart Miller","In dollars. When we are talking about that first-time buyer, if that\u2019s what your question was about? I was a little confused.","Stephen Kim","Yes, I was talking about the first-time buyer, specifically that segment of the market. Okay. So then, I guess, the next question...","Bruce Gross","Net flat.","Stephen Kim","Can you say that again?","Bruce Gross","Net flat.","Stuart Miller","Net flat, because they are going to be quicker churn deals, Steve.","Stephen Kim","Okay, alright. That\u2019s great. And then second question relates to your comments about soft pivot, obviously there has been a lot of questions and you are probably going to continue to be there. One question that I had is whether or not there are certain geographies that are more conducive to this shift in strategy, in other words, over the course, again, over the course 2 to 3 years, should we expect a natural shift in your geographic exposure as a result of what you are seeking to do with your soft pivot strategy?","Stuart Miller","Well, the markets that are more conducive to the softer pivot are ones that have a broader base of third-party developers. So, if you think about the Texas markets, parts of the Carolina, some of Florida, parts of California, where there is an emerging third-party development market, those are more conducive to having someone else by the land, produce it to you and being shorter term deals to the extent that we have to be the developer of course. We take on a longer term obligation associated with buying, developing and building.","Stephen Kim","That\u2019s kind of what I was thinking. Okay, thanks very much guys.","Stuart Miller","Okay. Let\u2019s take the last question.","Operator","That is noted. The next question is from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Tomasello","This is actually Ryan Tomasello on for Jade. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Just going back to the Rialto side with risk retention implementation quickly approaching for December, I was wondering if you could provide an update on that opportunity and if you are seeing any demand from third-party capital and the potential to raise funds around that strategy?","Stuart Miller","Well, I will let Jeff weigh in, in a second, but I will say that we are well into our capital raise. We have the capital available to be well-positioned for the market as it evolves. But the way that the market is evolving raises perhaps more questions than answers at this particular point and requires some experimentation. So, there isn\u2019t real clarity from the market standpoint around risk retention at this point. But in the midst of confusion, if you have capital, the opportunities abound. So Jeff, why don\u2019t you take it from there?","Jeff Krasnoff","Yes, we have continued to try to be industry leaders and innovators in this area. And some of the banks, in terms of, I don\u2019t know how much you have been following what\u2019s been going on, but some of the banks have actually been trying to get some of the plumbing done in advance of the December 24 date when the new rules go into effect. And we have been right there side by side with them. As a matter of fact, the first risk retention compliant deal was done by actually by three banks that we participated in. We were basically chosen at the end of the day because of our ability to really help with this sort of innovation. Now, it wasn\u2019t required to be done, but the idea was to try to get it done. A couple of other banks are also looking at that and are looking at other alternatives. And for those of you who don\u2019t know risk retention basically means that if you are originating loans to be securitized that you have to retain 5% of the economics of this transaction to basically show you have some \u2013 that you are eating your own cooking. But they left an exception just for CMBS that says that you can bring in what\u2019s called a B-Piece buyer, of which we are the largest B-Piece buyer in the market and have been through our fund vehicles since the market started coming back in 2010, 2011. So \u2013 but there are, let\u2019s say, there are three or four other ways that we sort of have three or four different ponies in this race that we also have in terms of structures that we are working with originators, of which we are through RMF, which we are as well and we remain very optimistic about how this is going to play out.","Stuart Miller","At the end of the day, this is our specialty. It\u2019s an area that is confused at this point. We think Jade that we are going to have \u2013 we have the capital and we are going to have the opportunity to invest a lot more capital at very attractive returns as risk retention sorts itself out.","Ryan Tomasello","Great. That was great color. And then just switching gears to the multifamily front, can you provide a quick overview of the pipeline of that business in terms of the geographic focus and perhaps what other markets you view as attractive for that product over the next few years?","Bruce Gross","As Rick gathers a paper or two to answer that question, let me just say that there is a lot of discussion about some overheated rental markets and there are some particularly in some of the core city centric markets. Those generally have not been the areas where we have focused our attention. And the broader markets that really require kind of the bread and butter rental communities are healthy, vibrant and where we focused our attention. So Rick, go ahead.","Rick Beckwitt","Yes, we are really spread across nationally amongst 22 to 25 metropolitan areas, some suburban, some mini urban, all transit-oriented and in markets that are really high growth, low vacancy. And I can \u2013 we can give you a list of or you can go to the website and see all of the places that we have got communities going and then that will give you a good sense of where we are looking.","Jeff Krasnoff","It\u2019s very similar to our for-sale footprint with few exceptions.","Stuart Miller","Right. Think about that the for-sale footprint as kind of being the roadmap. We don\u2019t deploy our for-sale personnel in the rental effort. So, it is separate management groups, but they do feed off of each other in terms of market intelligence and general market data. So, we benefit by being coexistent in those markets, but we are not interdependent. And those markets that we have chosen as being best in the country to deploy our for-sale business work just as well on the rental basis.","Ryan Tomasello","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Stuart Miller","You bet.","Stuart Miller","Alright. Thank you everyone for joining our third quarter update. Look forward to updating at year end. Have a nice day.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."],"12803":["Lennar (NYSE:LEN) Q1 2012 Earnings Call March 27, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","David M. Collins - Principal Accounting Officer and Controller","Stuart A.

Miller","Okay, good. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our First Quarter 2012 Update. I'm joined here as always by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; Dave Collins, our Controller. We also have Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto.","I'm going to give some overview remarks both on the economy and the housing market and on Lennar in particular, and then I'm going to turn it over to the management team to give additional background in detail. After we open the phone lines, as always, we'd like to ask that you limit your question to just one question, one follow-up please, so that we can be as fair as possible to all.","So as I sit here today, I'm really pleased with our solid first quarter 2012 operating results, and what they represent relative to the housing market in general and to Lennar in particular. Our first quarter results reflect another quarter of confirmation that both the housing market and the overall economy are stabilizing, and that a very real trend is beginning to take shape. They also demonstrate that our operating team is executing extremely well in a complicated environment.","I previewed in our third and fourth quarter conference calls that we were beginning to see evidence of a genuine turn in the residential housing market, and this could be a harbinger of market stability. Last quarter, I was feeling somewhat more confident that the market was, in fact, changing, and this quarter marks further evidence that stabilization is really taking hold.","The consistent message is that the general environment is different now than it's been in the past many years. There are discernible fundamental shifts appearing in the home market, and there are empirical data points that are, to-date, confirming that the market is showing real signs of stability. With that said, and as we saw from last week's reported national sales starts and permits numbers, yesterday's pending home sales numbers and today's Case-Shiller Index, that the housing market is not yet in full recovery. In fact, the stabilization process after a full 7-year decline in housing is rocky and erratic and is certainly not yet broad based.","Let me tell you a little bit about how we are thinking about the things that we're seeing in the field versus the national numbers that are being reported. Four important themes are driving housing stabilization; 3 are demand-related and 1 is supply-related. First, today's consumer is looking at the home purchase differently than in the past years. The home purchase is no longer a place to invest savings in order to ride a wave of price increases. Instead, today's buyers are looking for real value. They are finding real value in for-sale housing. We know that home prices and volumes are low and interest rates are at historical lows and affordability is extremely high today. Today's consumers are beginning to realize that housing presents an undeniable value proposition, and we're hearing this from them in the field. Accordingly, we're experiencing more traffic in our welcome home centers and customers are actively discussing their desire to find a way to purchase and capitalize on this moment in time. They're starting to feel pressure not to miss this moment, and that's being reinforced by discussion with family and friends, buying and owning a home is no longer taboo at the dining room table. And in the field, we're witnessing instances where customers returning for a second visit are finding that the home that they wanted is sold.","Second trend, today's housing consumers also seeking to avoid the rental market. The fully loaded cost of ownership is lower in most desirable markets than comparable rental rates. We've carefully studied this trend and have found that while this might not show up in national statistics, in local competitive markets, principal, interest, taxes, insurance, community association, lawn care are all together lower than the competitive rental market. Today, for-sale housing represents an excellent value proposition on a pure monthly payment basis versus renting.","Additionally, consumers are looking for an alternative to the annual repricing inherent in the rental market. Rental prices are high, and they've been moving up. Today's consumer is looking for living cost stability, as well as a safe and stable place to raise a family. They're looking to reconsider the rental lifestyle, where rental rates have been rising and are likely to continue to rise for the foreseeable future.","Third trend, improvement in employment and consumer confidence has translated into the end of negative household formation. The trend of children moving home and elderly parents moving in with children is at least slowing and may be reversing. Over time, this trend will be an even more powerful driver of demand increases.","Now some have suggested that the gains in the first part of the year might be weather-related, since it's been abnormally warm in the North. We, however, see strength across our platform, including warmer markets where weather is not a factor, and where warmth in the North might even be a negative to sales in the South. It seems that the improvements derive from fundamental shifts.","On the supply side, concerns remain about the overhang of REO and foreclosure inventory. As I noted earlier, market improvement is uneven across cities, states and the country. In the field, we are seeing pockets of activity develop across the country, not region- or state-specific. These pockets are developing in many areas that are starting to recover. These are geographic pockets that are defined by their desirable location, driving the absorption of REO, foreclosure and defaulted loan inventory. Supply is running short in these areas and demand is pushing prices higher in some instances or is pushing the boundaries of desirability outward in other instances. The broader market, outside these pockets of activity, remain weak. While at present, these pockets are isolated, they are growing in both size and number.","It's likely that national numbers are not reflecting these themes because they incorporate and average in their data the secondary and tertiary markets that are not yet in recovery and do not affect our competitive landscape. But the more desirable housing markets are experiencing a fundamental change as foreclosure inventories have been absorbed, fewer distressed investor sales are being made and consumers recognize the value proposition.","Overall, we've seen that demand is growing, and in carefully selected markets, supply is limited. Nevertheless, demand still remains constrained or is being held back by the mortgage qualification standards and processes that have been overcorrected by the severity of the downturn, but demand is growing and customers are looking to find ways to qualify for loan and waiting for some loosening of credit standards.","Turning now to Lennar specifically. In our first quarter, we saw a fundamental improvement in all of the building blocks that define our homebuilding and Financial Services operations, while Rialto continued to build and augment its blue-chip operating platform. Our management team is executing on all fronts.","On the homebuilding front, sales continued a significant pattern of improvement, growing 33% over first quarter 2011, and that compares trend-wise to a 20% year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter of last year. Our improved sales year-over-year and sequentially come from a fairly flat community count, which means that our sales per community are improving. Perhaps most notably, these sales improvements are not the result of unusual sales promotions or discounts as reflected by our improved gross and net margins. Post-impairment gross margins improved from 20% to 20.9%, while post-impairment net margin improved 3.6% to 6%.","We are maintaining and even growing margins while expanding sales. These margin gains are reflective of a fundamentally sound sales program that is not compromising margin to gain sales, but instead is maintaining price stability, reducing incentives and beginning to show overhead leverage as volume improves.","Additionally, we're not pushing to grow the quantity of active communities, but are more focused on the quality of our active communities. Accordingly, we have invested cash aggressively to position our company with high-quality communities in A locations that enable us to produce solid margins and leverage overhead. This affords us the position to be able to manage our business with carefully designed value-oriented product and efficient production and marketing program under our Everything's Included branding and a rightsized overhead structure.","As we look ahead to future quarters, our strategy of focusing on high margins in well-positioned communities will prove to be the engine that drives SG&A operating leverage that will produce strong bottom line earnings. Rick and Jon will describe our homebuilding operations strategy in greater detail in just a minute.","Our Financial Services segment also performed very well in our first quarter. It generated operating earnings of $8.3 million versus $1.2 million last year. Earnings here derive from a consistent mortgage and title program that reports through our Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Gross, who will further describe how this important segment is not only profitable, but is providing consistency and dependability in a difficult mortgage environment.","Finally, our Rialto segment has also produced profits in the first quarter as it continued to grow its underlying business. While Rialto earnings have declined year-over-year, from $11 million last year to $9.4 million this year, we have noted that Rialto profits have the general tendency to be less predictable on a quarter-by-quarter basis as we carefully manage the sale and resolution of assets to maximize value. We remain very enthusiastic about the earnings power in the assets we've already purchased, and we're certain that future quarters will demonstrate the investment and earnings power of the overall Rialto machine.","As I noted last quarter, Rialto completed its money raise for its first fund and ended with a $700-million pool of capital to invest in core assets to drive its future. To date, about 70% of that fund is invested and the pipeline for new investments is very strong. This fund will likely be fully invested by year end, and we will soon begin working on the capital raise for fund #2.","As we look ahead, Rialto will continue to be a solid earnings contributor for Lennar and will begin to return cash to corporate as it is now investing self-generated funds. Jeff Krasnoff will give additional detail on Rialto's operations in just a few minutes as well.","All in all, our first quarter has been an excellent start for 2012 for Lennar as we've navigated the turbulent waters of the housing market in the U.S. economy seeking a bottom and stability. Our strategy has been to refine and position our company for recovery and remain profitable while we stay patient. This strategy has worked well for us.","All of the segments of our company are now extremely well positioned, as you will now hear from our operating team. As I look ahead to the future quarters, I remain cautiously optimistic that we are seeing a real bottom form, and that we will begin to see a real recovery. National statistics and news will give us mixed signals as we move through the year as they represent a compendium of all of the best and the worst markets around the country. But I feel that stabilization and recovery will emanate from the most desirable markets and spread slowly outward over the next years. Lennar is positioned with a strong balance sheet in the right markets, with an exceptional management team and a well-constructed strategy to perform solidly as market conditions continue to improve.","Now I'd like to turn over to Rick.","Richard Beckwitt","Thanks, Stuart. We are really pleased with our operating results this quarter. These results were driven by both a well-executed land acquisition strategy and a fine-tuned homebuilding machine. I'm going to review our land activities and highlight what differentiates Lennar from our competition. Jon is then going to discuss our building activities and how we maximize the value of our land assets.","There's no question in my mind that profitability in this business starts with land. You need to be in the right location at the right cost, at the right time, and with the right product to generate above market returns and sales. This takes great relationships with banks and land sellers, and it requires meticulous underwriting and market research. It also requires a team of land acquisition professionals that know how to scour the markets for unique opportunities.","During the first quarter, we continued to focus on acquiring and optioning new homesites that would have a positive impact on our bottom line. Our primary focus was pursuing distressed opportunities with banks and other extremely motivated sellers through off-market deals in a noncompetitive process. Our new acquisitions were located in markets where we saw the greatest strength and value proposition. As in the past, our focus has been on highly desirable communities located in micro-markets where people really want to live and where foreclosed homes have already been absorbed by the market. We invested in A-plus areas and stayed away from the fringe or tertiary markets, where price was the only driver. This micro-market investment focus has significantly enhanced our gross margins and our new sales orders.","This quarter, we purchased 4,225 homesites for $200 million -- $212 million, and we spent $61 million on land development. Combined, our land acquisition and land development spend was up about 34% over the prior-year period. In the first quarter, we also gained title to an additional 3,400 homesites through negotiated settlements. In addition, we signed option contracts to acquire approximately 1,340 homesites. As you can see, this was a very busy and highly productive quarter for Lennar on the land acquisition side.","From a geographic standpoint, approximately 39% of our land purchases in the first quarter were located in Florida, 22% in Texas, 14% in the Pacific Northwest, 11% in the mid-Atlantic, 10% in the West, with the remaining 4% spread throughout our other markets. As in prior quarters, the lion's share of our new land deals were sourced outside of a competitive bid environment. We stayed away from the typical broker to bid type of deals and directly sourced a large percentage of our land transaction. This is a clear differentiating factor for Lennar.","Another key difference is our willingness to engage in highly complicated transactions that requires significant planning and take months, if not years, to reach the end result. These deals are not for the faint of heart and require an intricate knowledge of vested entitlements and creditor rights. But when carefully executed, these opportunities can be incredibly profitable and generate outsized returns.","To give you a sense of what I'm talking about, I would like to highlight 2 transactions that came together last quarter. Negotiations on these 2 transaction began almost 2 years ago, and we subsequently purchased the debt at deep discounts in fiscal 2011 and took title to the land in the first quarter of 2012.","We are now the proud owner of a crown jewel position in Doral, Florida, one of the hottest submarkets in the United States. Representing more than half a square mile, this property has approximately 2,400 homesites and will be an extremely profitable multiyear position for the company. This deal involved the purchase of more than $218 million of debt instruments, including CDD bonds, community development district bonds, loans held by multiple banks, delinquent taxes and was subject to a litigation between the prior land developer and owner and various creditors. In addition, the CDD and the bank debt had competing first lien positions on the collateral, creating the perfect storm. For us, this represented an incredible opportunity in our backyard, a 3-dimensional chess game with no other viable buyer. So we mapped out a detailed plan to resolve the dispute and gain control of the first lien positions. What we needed to do was bring everyone to the table to create a workable solution. Fortunately, we had a great relationship with the banks, the bondholders and the original land developer, so we were able to work with each group individually to create a win-win for everyone involved.","After months of intense negotiation, we acquired the CDD bonds and the first lien bank debt in 2011 and then settled with the original developer and a second position bank in 2012. This new Doral community, which is a stone's throw from our corporate office, will drive margins for years to come because of its extremely attractive land bases. We should deliver our first homes in this community by year end.","The second transaction involved a property in Naples, Florida. In the first quarter of this year, we took ownership of a high-end, substantially developed master-planned community with a fully operation TPC golf course. This community has the only TPC-branded golf course in Southwest Florida. The property, just located 5 miles from downtown Naples, included more than 1,000 acres and 1,050 homesites, 32% of which were fully developed. Similar to the Doral opportunity I described earlier, this deal involved approximately $158 million in debt instruments, including CDD bonds, traditional bank debt held by multiple banks and delinquent taxes. We began our diligence on this opportunity in early 2010 and created a strategy to harness the enormous potential value of this asset. During our diligence, we uncovered that the encumbered collateral also included a 10-acre commercial property fronting a major Naples thoroughfare and a 1.5-acre marina in downtown Naples, which in addition to the golf course community, made this investment a no-brainer if we could put the pieces together.","We started negotiations with the various lenders and bondholders in 2010, acquired the bank debt and tax certificates in entirely 2011 and restructured and purchased the CDD in the first quarter of 2012. Through a lot of hard work and tenacity, we acquired at a significant discount one of the finest golf course communities in Florida, and we'll have a multiyear highly profitable building program going forward.","I hope these 2 deals give you a sense of some of the unique investments we've been making. While the land market has heated up recently, we continue to see great opportunities out there. We are still underwriting our new deals to exceed a 20% gross margin and a 20% IRR with no inflation.","To date, we've been extremely pleased with the performance of our new land acquisitions. During the first quarter, approximately 45% of our deliveries came from communities purchased or put under control in the last 3 years. Our gross margin on the closings in these deals continue to be 200 basis points higher than the overall company average.","Before I turn it over to Jon, let me give you some final stats. On a year-over-year basis, our inventory increased about $428 million to approximately $4.3 billion and this excludes consolidated inventory not owned. Our inventory during the first quarter increased about $317 million from the end of 2011. At February 29, 2012, we owned and controlled 117,086 homesites and had 426 active communities. While our community count is down on a year-over-year basis, it increased slightly during the first quarter. As Stuart said, we are focused more on community quality and not quantity. This should be very clear from our operating results. Nonetheless, you should see our community count increase by about 5% to 10% by year end based on our land acquisition activity.","Finally, I'd like to think our land acquisition staff across the country and in particular, our team in Florida. I have no doubt that we have the best team in the business.","Like to turn it over to Jon now.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Thank you, Rick, and good morning. As Stuart noted, we're very pleased with our first quarter results of a post-impairment 20.9% gross margin and 6% operating margin, respectively 90- and 240-basis-point improvements. This achievement was the result of continued intense focus by our management team on each of the component parts of our business. I will speak to how once the land is in place, we derive profitability by our management of product, pricing, direct cost and leveraging our operating structure. To ensure that the homes we build are a great value to the homebuyer, each land acquisition is underwritten with the strategy of executing our Everything's Included platform. This means that what we have \u2013 that we have done the research to know exactly what we'll be offering in home designs, square footages and included features that together present a great value to the homebuyer. Lennar's Everything's Included approach not only continues to compete effectively against resales, but also presents a great value to renters who are looking at the opportunity to buy a home.","This process, combined with an improving sales environment, enabled us to achieve a 33% year-over-year improvement in new orders without the aid of increased community count and while maintaining healthy gross margins. Much of our sales strength in the first quarter continued to be driven by the strong performance of our well-located new communities, where we achieved a higher sales pace compared to our legacy communities. However, we did begin to see improvement in these legacy communities midway and through the quarter in most of our markets.","New orders from our new communities increased to 48% of our Q1 orders, up from 35% last year. This quarter we experienced increase in higher quality traffic levels in our communities, up from what we saw in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we saw a sequential improvement in new orders month-over-month, and so far in March, we are seeing continued strength similar to the absorption rates we saw at the end of the first quarter.","We are actively working with potential homebuyers on credit repair and reaching out to existing renters to educate them on the benefits of homeownership. A good example of this is an event we recently held in Las Vegas. To market our credit repair program and home purchase opportunities to renters, we had a gourmet food truck challenge. I don't know if the gourmet food truck craze has hit where you live yet, but it is very strong in Vegas. Our division held the event at a shopping center parking lot that is central to multiple rental communities. In other words, we went to where the potential customers live rather than spending advertising dollars trying to bring them to us.","Between our own social media efforts, along with flyers, postcards and door hangers, the social media efforts of the food truck companies and drive-by traffic, we had a tremendous turnout. This led to hundreds of people registering with us, many starting a credit repair process and visiting our communities.","Our mortgage company, Universal American Mortgage Company, was at the event working to help educate these potential buyers. This was a great success, an example of how we benefit from our strong and consistent relationship with UAMC.","As the market continues to recover, and we begin to see sales prices improve, we are also seeing adjustment on the cost side of our business. We are optimistic that these cost pressures will be offset by sales price improvements, as well as by some cost savings that are structural and long term. It is for these reasons that we expect gross margins to remain level, but we expect net operating margins to improve from our operating leverage. We see this in the year-over-year first quarter comparisons of gross margin improvement from 20% to 20.9%, while net margins improved from 3.6% to 6%. As in the prior 5 quarters, our current average direct cost of homes remains in the range of $40 to $42 per square foot. We have a very thorough process of breaking down detailed cost in each of the items that make up a cost category onto an item master. This allows us to negotiate price protection on specific items and to value engineer lasting improvements.","An example of this is with engineered wood products. This would primarily be I-Joist and beams. We've engineered more efficient home designs, where the needs and values for engineered wood products are less. This has allowed us to save $500 per home at the same time that the cost of engineered lumber has increased.","We are also focused intently on managing extras. Extras are items charged to the builder beyond the contract amount. With the benefit of greater detail provided by the unbundling process and Item Master, we are able to create more accountability in managing extras. This allows us to quickly adjust contracts scopes of work, to eliminate these costs from the system. As I said, as sales prices increase -- sales prices improve, there will be various fluctuations in some materials, commodities and labor. But our purchasing systems and processes, combined with improving sales pricing, will have us well positioned to maintain our gross margins.","This quarter, we saw the ability to leverage our operating structure as the year-over-year 30% improvement in deliveries helped us achieve an SG&A percentage of 14.9%, a year-over-year 150-basis-point improvement. We continue to maintain our intense management of SG&A cost. Similar to direct cost, I believe that we have made structural changes that allow us to affect long-lasting savings as our volume increases. We have in place a very strong management team that is organized in a simplified regional and divisional structure that will allow for growth with few additions to the structure.","I do want to note that in the first quarter we expensed overhead associated with our new Seattle and Portland operations, but as I previously stated, we will see deliveries from those operations in the back half of the year.","Across our divisions we are actively and intensely managing each of the components that make up our net operating margin. I want to thank our associates for their focus and execution of each of these components of our business and achieving our ninth straight quarter of positive post-impairment operating margin.","Thank you. And I would now like to turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Before Bruce reviews the details behind Rialto's $9.4 million of operating earnings for the quarter, along with the results for the rest of the company, there were a few areas that might be helpful to touch on to give a little bit more perspective on what's going on at Rialto.","As an integral part of the Lennar story, our focused Rialto team that now includes over 200 strong, continues to push forward the resolution and value add of distressed and advantageously priced real estate assets. Being able to integrate the unique talents and well-coordinated resources of the entire Lennar team has been and continues to be a unique advantage that has positioned Rialto extremely well. Rialto currently has 3 areas from which it derives its revenue and earnings: PPIP, our balance sheet portfolio investments and our fund business. If you recall, Rialto's first investment opportunity was our PPIP fund with AllianceBernstein and the U.S. Treasury. From inception, this $4.6 billion funds mortgage-backed securities portfolio has produced a steady stream of interest income and fees on our $68 million investment that it's been at or above our expectations. And during this past quarter, as the capital markets gained new optimism about the fundamentals behind the home mortgage securities that back the lion's share of our investment portfolio, we saw the mark-to-market on our investment regain about $8.4 million of value that had been marked down in prior quarters.","During the quarter, we continued to create value from our second income generator, our balance sheet distressed real estate portfolios. These include our 2 FDIC transactions and our initial bank portfolio investments. In addition to collecting $560 million in cash to date on these portfolios, we have now repositioned over $1.6 billion of loans into owned real estate, which includes developer homes, land and all varieties of commercial properties across the country. Our activities in these investments include adding property improvements, paying legal fees, in some cases, the payment of several years of past-due property taxes, the majority of which are nonrecurring. Because most of these costs are expensed as incurred and revenue is recognized as properties are sold or collections are made from guarantors, in the short run, earnings from this portion of the business will have the tendency to be less predictable. In this area, while our revenues and earnings were less than prior quarters, we remain comfortable we will produce the results we sought when we initially invested in these assets as we carefully manage their dispositions to maximize value.","In our third area, our fund business, as we mentioned last quarter, and Stuart mentioned earlier, our current exclusive investment vehicle is the Rialto real estate fund, which now has $700 million of equity commitments from over 2 dozen different investor groups, including $75 million from us. The fund has been able to acquire or tie up over 30 different transactions, and our pipeline of new investments continues to be strong. We've already invested approximately $520 million of fund equity to acquire about $1.5 billion of assets based on unpaid principal balance for about $0.38 on the dollar. About 3\/4 of our fund investments so far have been distressed portfolios from regional and community banks, CMBS special servicers and nonbank financial institutions. The bulk of the remaining investments are in new issue CMBS securities with strong current cash flows, where we found attractive pricing unlike any we have seen since the 1990s. And through the end of the quarter, the fund has already collected $65 million from interest, principal and asset resolutions at levels significantly higher and sooner than originally anticipated.","Even with the most recent improvements in the capital markets, lenders still remain under both internal and external pressure to dispose of distressed real estate assets as they try to get back into the lending business. In addition, with over $1 trillion of commercial real estate debt coming due in the next 3 years, we expect to continue to see an abundance of opportunities that fit perfectly with our skill set and deep relationships that we have developed with a number of key sellers. As a result, we're currently focusing on bringing out our next investment vehicle. We believe that these and future funds will not only help to enhance the company's returns and add consistent cash flow and earnings, but will also be important building blocks for us to develop a first-class investment management business.","These are just a few of the reasons we remain excited about the continued progress of our Rialto franchise, our current position in the marketplace and the synergies with the rest of the Lennar team.","And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Bruce. Thank you.","Bruce E. Gross","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. Before I provide more details on our numbers, I'd like to comment on our Financial Services segment, which is always reported to our corporate office and has been run distinctly separate from our sales and homebuilding operations.","Our Financial Services business segment generated operating earnings of $8.3 million versus $1.2 million last year, and this is the strongest first quarter operating earnings for our Financial Services in 5 years. Our mortgage pretax income increased to $8.9 million from $3.4 million in the prior year. And this quarter's mortgage originations increased by 33% to $743 million. With the significant operating leverage in our mortgage operations, this resulted in a 160% increase in pretax earnings. Our in-house mortgage company had a capture rate of Lennar homebuyers of 78% in the first quarter. The mortgage company's home loan advisors communicate with prospective Lennar homebuyers very early in the buying process and by understanding the homebuyer's ability to qualify for a mortgage, this has helped Lennar's cancellation rate remain at very low levels. This quarter's cancellation rate was 18%. Having an effective mortgage company working with the homebuilder has led to consistency and dependability for homebuilding deliveries as noted by our consistent backlog conversion ratio that's been over 100% consistently.","The first quarter is historically the lowest volume quarter for the title company. Our title company had a $100,000 loss in the first quarter, but that improved compared to the $1.7 million loss in the prior year, and this was a result of additional cost saving initiatives that were successfully implemented. Approximately 10% of our title company transactions were with Lennar homebuyers, and the remainder were with third parties.","The hard-working associates in our Financial Services segment have consolidated operations, refined processes and are well positioned to see continued operating leverage as the housing market recovers.","Turning back to our overall results, starting with homebuilding, revenues from home sales increased 33% at $611 million, driven by a 30% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% increase in average sales price to $246,000. The average sales price by region is as follows: the East region was $222,000, and that was up 3%; Southeast Florida region was $265,000, that was up 1%; Central was $220,000, that was up 4%; Houston was $230,000, up 3%; West was $317,000, up 5%; and other was $361,000, down 6%.","The gross margin on home sales that was reported at 20.9% in the first quarter was up 90 basis points to the prior year. And as you remember in our last conference call, we did provide a gross margin percentage range for 2012 of 19.5% to 21.5% before impairments. We came in at the higher end of the range due to delivering a more favorable product mix of higher gross margin percent homes, which includes an increasing percentage of deliveries from new communities, which Rick touched on.","The gross margins were strongest in the East and Southeast Florida regions this quarter, and sales incentives as a percentage of home sale revenue was consistent with our fourth quarter at 12.2% and up just slightly from last year's first quarter at 12.1% as a percentage of home sale revenue.","As a result of the strong gross margins and improvements in SG&A that Jon talked about, our homebuilding operating margins improved 240 basis points from the prior year to 6%. This was the highest first quarter operating margin in 6 years. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries was $1.1 million versus $8.7 million in the prior year. The large gain in the prior year was due to the company booking its share of a gain on debt extinguishment at one of the company's joint ventures, partially offset by valuation adjustments.","Other income was $4.1 million versus $30 million in the prior year, and the large gain in the prior year was due to $29.5 million of the $37.5 million litigation settlement, which was included in the other income line. Impairments declined significantly in this year's first quarter to only $2 million versus $22 million in the prior year's quarter.","Turning to our Rialto business segment, they generated operating earnings of $9.4 million, and this number is after adding back $4.3 million of net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest versus $11 million in the prior year. The composition of Rialto's $9.4 million of operating earnings by type of investment is as follows: The FDIC portfolios had a $1.5 million loss, non-FDIC portfolios had a $1.2 million loss, PPIP contributed $11 million of earnings and the Rialto real estate fund contributed $7.6 million of earnings. Then subtracting out $6.5 million of general and administration expenses and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $5.9 million, you will get to the $9.4 million of operating earnings.","The negative $2.7 million contribution from the FDIC and non-FDIC portfolios this quarter are primarily due to 2 items: First, as Jeff touched on, revenue was impacted by the timing of deficiency collections and REO activity. Second, as REO inventory increased, there is an acceleration of expenses relating to catching up on prior year's unpaid property taxes and legal expenses incurred to collect on deficiency judgments. These results will vary from quarter to quarter due to the uneven timing of deficiency collections and REO activity.  Additionally, we're in the process of petitioning to reduce property taxes on the REO properties going forward.","The $11 million of earnings this quarter from our investment in PPIP is reported as equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities, the equity in earnings included net gains in the PPIP fund of $8.4 million, which relates primarily to unrealized gains as a result of mark-to-market adjustments, plus $2.6 million of interest income.","Our interest in the Rialto real estate fund is also reported as equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and generated approximately $7.6 million of profits for the quarter in addition to the management fees highlighted above. Rialto continues to generate strong cash flow, and at quarter end, the FDIC debt was paid down by $157 million, reducing the outstanding FDIC debt to $470 million. Additionally, there was $185 million in the defeasance account and in Rialto's cash account combined to further retire debt.","The add back in calculating diluted earnings per share for our convertible securities was $2.9 million for this quarter. And during the quarter, our balance sheet remained strong. We continued to have ample liquidity, and our leverage remained low as our homebuilding debt to total capital, net of the $800 million of cash, was 49.6%. During the quarter, we raised an additional $50 million relating to the closing of the over-allotment portion of the 3.25% convertible senior notes.","Let me provide some more detail on our $4.3 billion of inventory. Finished homesites during the quarter amounted to $576 million, and our construction-in-progress account was $854 million, totaling a combined $1.4 billion in that category. Land and land under development was $2.9 billion. We carefully managed our inventory during the quarter, and we ended the quarter averaging 1.5 completed unsold homes per community. There were 1,523 homes under construction that were sold and 2,293 unsold.","Active community count during the quarter ended at 426 versus 422 sequentially in our fourth quarter. We opened 54 communities during the quarter and closed out of 50.","In conclusion, we ended the quarter with our strongest quarterly backlog growth in about 10 years, up 39%. As this backlog converts to deliveries, and we continue through 2012, we expect to see the significant operating leverage in our business translate into improving operating margins and profitability.","And with that, let me turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","My question relates to your comment, Bruce, on significant operating leverage, and understanding if there's opportunity to elaborate on that. And then just secondly, as it relates to your cost structure, a lot of people feel that Lennar's better than their peer average gross margins is related to their low lot cost basis, and yet, really the focus is on your strategy to provide Everything's Included versus homebuilders with design studios, and I was wondering if you can quantify some of the cost savings that are attainable [ph] because of your strategy on providing Everything's Included and maybe differentiate the company in that respect from an operating perspective?","Bruce E. Gross","Let me take the first part, Ivy, and then I'll turn it over to the operators to talk about your second part of the question. When we talk about significant operating leverage, when we have additional absorption per community, the incremental operating margin goes up considerably. So as you look at our gross margin, if it was flat at 21%, and with our SG&A where it is today at 14.9%, one more sale per community has an incremental SG&A expense of about 4.5%. So the incremental operating margin is approximately 16% as our absorption increases per community. That's where the significant operating leverage is coming from, and that's why we believe our operating margins will continue to grow as volume picks up.","Stuart A. Miller","Yes, we really highlighted in our remarks that we focused on the quality of communities rather than quantity because that's where we pick up the greatest operating leverage. If we can increase the number of sales per community as a first round of improvement, we're going to start to see some real earnings strength out of that. As to your second question...","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","That was not limited to just the SG&A though, correct? It's gross margin is benefiting as well?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, we're not commenting as aggressively on that. We recognize that as prices go up, some of the cost will go up as well. We do think that there will be gross margin improvement as well. But I think that we're going to wait and see how the market evolves for that. But certainly, the net margin benefits more dramatically. As it relates to Everything's Included, we've long believed that our EI platform is an efficient operating platform. But even more so, at the beginning of recovery and as the market remains a more value-oriented market at other times in a market cycle, where there's pricing power and there's the ability to pass on the greater margins in options and extras, I think the 2 platforms compete more favorably. But at this point in the cycle, we think that the Everything's Included platform really affords us the opportunity to keep our overhead carefully in line, to keep our construction costs really at low levels, to deliver the options and upgrades that people are looking for and that they place value on and to keep our pricing structure very value oriented so that it appeals to the greatest number of consumers. And I think that operating strategy is an important component of what's driving our margins right now.","Operator","The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My first question relates to your commentary about pricing. I was particularly intrigued by that because it's something that we've observed in the marketplace as well, the willingness and the ability of builders to put through price increases with an increase in volume. Can you give us a sense for your strategy for implementing price increases? And can you provide a little bit more color as to how isolated the opportunities are to raise prices in the marketplace? And by price increases, by the way, I should specify I'm not just talking about nominal price increases, I'm also talking about reduced incentives and increased lot premiums.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Stephen, it's Jon. That's a good point. It comes in both forms, the ability to increase prices, as well as to reduce incentives. It really varies at this point in the market recovery market by market. We're seeing in some of our markets the ability to have perhaps over 50% of the community to be able achieve one of those advantages and then in other markets they're still in the 10% to 15% range. But strategically, we're trying to implement at least some level of price improvement so that we deliver that message of confidence both internally and externally.","Richard Beckwitt","From a strategy standpoint, Steve, we look at each community as a separate profit center, and we know from looking at the market demand, where the lines cross with regard to pushing absorption versus raising prices. In communities where we have a longer land position, we benefit more by increasing the prices, getting the appraisals up because our margins will be better on a long-term basis. So we look at each one individually. Across the board, we have instituted price increases in probably most of the communities or taken incentives down. There's a handful of ones that are still a little bit challenged from a price standpoint, but we will be aggressively moving prices, particularly because it allows us to pull people off of the fence.","Stuart A. Miller","And additionally, land is harder and harder to replace. We don't want to leave opportunity on the table by selling through quickly land positions that are particularly well located.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, all of that makes a tremendous amount of sense. Follow-up question relates to your commentary about incremental margin. I think you said somewhere in the vicinity of 16.5% incremental operating margin. You were talking primarily there on the power of leveraging of SG&A it seems like. I was curious as to whether you could comment on your -- the degree to which that incremental margin may actually be higher as you migrate into communities, which are not Everything's Included or if, in fact, it would have a negative impact on your contribution margin. What is your view on how an Everything's Included strategy and the extremely high backlog conversion ratio that comes with that would contrast with a more standard kind of option-type package as we go forward?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, let's see if I can break that down. The 16% incremental margin derives from additional deliveries in existing communities. And so it's where we're growing from 2 sales per month to 3 sales per month, the incremental overhead is very, very small relative to the 15-ish percent that we're running right now. And so we see a tremendous amount of leverage in the growth of sales per community. So certainly, within the community, there wouldn't be an introduction of a different operating platform. But right now, all of our communities in at least some modified way are operating under an EI, Everything's Included platform. And so we wouldn't have a sense of -- or a good sense of what the differentiation or the differential in overhead would be for a design studio or option-based program. And I wouldn't venture that guess. I would also highlight, I don't mean to strike a competitive note here, I think that there are operators out there that can operate a design studio approach. In our world, we think that EI is more efficient.","Richard Beckwitt","The main benefit, Steve, from an EI platform really comes through the cost side. We can negotiate better costs on the materials. There's increased cycle time with regarding delivery. There's less mistakes from the trade standpoint in putting the options or upgrades in the wrong location in the home. So it's speed of delivery and the cost of having that asset for the time period that it's on your books.","Stuart A. Miller","But just to add to that, the EI program also does not necessitate a design studio facility. And sometimes, the people overhead associated with that. So it's both on the cost side and the G&A side.","Operator","The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan Chase.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question I just had was on the sales pace, a lot of success there, and it looks like roughly about 40% up year-over-year. You had mentioned in your prepared remarks that referring to March that you see continued strength and similar to the sales pace at the end of the quarter. Was just curious if the sales pace improved throughout the quarter, and we should be looking for even, we're talking about March being higher than the quarter average and if it's possible to kind of give us a degree of magnitude and regionally, what's driving that?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Well, I think if you look at the first quarter, starts off in December, which is impacted by the holidays. And so as I said, we did see that improvement sequentially through the quarter, and so far, March is evidencing consistency with what we saw in February which was...","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But I guess, I'm talking about a year-over-year, not -- sorry to interrupt, but not just sequentially I'm thinking.","Richard Beckwitt","Yes, both sequentially and year-over-year on a month-to-month basis, we saw improvement throughout the quarter with February being the strongest month of the quarter. And I think what Jon was trying to highlight is we're seeing similar strength in the stub period so far in March with the strength of the quarter that we had.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. Second question on the DTA, Bruce, just trying to get an update on that. I believe last quarter, you said it's, and correct me if I'm wrong, but something that you might be looking at on a quarter-to-quarter basis and doesn't necessarily have to be reversed at the end of your fiscal year. Is that still the case? And can you give us any updated thinking about that in terms of maybe what hurdles you need to cross to get that back on the balance sheet?","Bruce E. Gross","Sure. As we came out of the end of the year, the feeling was that we needed more discernible evidence that housing was recovering and the feeling was that we needed to give some time to go through the spring to see if that's the case. That was the biggest item. So if the company keeps its performance up and housing recovers through the spring, similar to what we're seeing here in February and March, I think there's a good chance that we'll be able to reverse the DTA as early as the second quarter, but certainly, we believe it will happen within this year.","Stuart A. Miller","Just as a kind of reminder, what we said is that the reversal of the DTA was more a question of the macro market than it was focused just on Lennar specific in our case. We've been able to demonstrate profitability for an extended period of time now. The question that still has been an overhang has been that of where is the macro market going? And I think as there is more evidence of stability in the marketplace, the reversal of the DTA will become more certain.","Operator","The next question is coming from Stephen East of ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The overview in your prepared comments was really helpful. It answered a lot of the questions I think. So on the land side, beyond what you talked about right now, is the profitability that you're seeing in the deals today similar to what you saw, what you had, at least pro forma over the last 3 years that are part of the 48% of your sales right now?","Richard Beckwitt","It depends on the deal. Clearly, the deals that are option oriented, finished home site, the margins are less in those opportunities. To the extent that we're doing transactions that incorporate bond purchases and things that are more complicated, we're still seeing great margins in those opportunities.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if we look at the cash, you all did spend a lot on development. You've got some debt due in coming in '13 and '14. Your equity is run a lot. You still, it sounds like, have a lot of opportunities to buy more land. Where do you think you wind up this year in cash and how do you envision either retiring or rolling your debt that you got coming in '13 and '14?","Bruce E. Gross","Stephen, this is Bruce. We feel very comfortable with our cash position today. The ending cash balance at the end of the year is going to be dependent on the additional opportunities we see with respect to land purchases through the year, what we decide to go forward with or not, as well as whether or not we have a revolving credit facility in place, which we do expect is likely to come soon. So we feel pretty comfortable on the liquidity side and on the debt maturity ladder side, you can expect that we'll continue to push out debt maturities or we'll use cash to pay down upcoming maturities.","Stuart A. Miller","Additionally, I just want to highlight that I've noted in my comments this morning and before that as we get towards the end of this year, we expect that some of the earlier investments that were made on balance sheet through Rialto will begin to cash flow more consistently. That's beyond the earnings statement, pure cash flow, that cash will start return to corporate. So that really helps our cash position as well.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, I've got you. If you look at the earnings power for Rialto in '12 or '13, can you put any type of framework around that?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, Rialto, as we've noted so many times before, is very difficult to put a number on. It's in large part because it is an opportunistic business where we focus on maximizing profitability from the assets that we've purchased. And as markets start to recover, the assets that we currently have accumulate greater value, and we want to carefully manage to maximize the return. So it's a lot of a timing issue, Stephen, and we're just \u2013 we're going to avoid giving guidance, but say that we're continuing to be very comfortable with the underwriting that we began with and where Rialto is going.","Operator","The next question is coming from Bob Wetenhall of RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Question, massive increase in sales, I was hoping maybe Bruce could give us some insight into what your thinking would be a normalized level of SG&A spending if orders remain in the current trajectory?","Bruce E. Gross","Well, let me just say, Bob, that if you go back over the last decade before the peak, we were used to running our SG&A expenses as a percent of home sales in the 10% range. So once you get back to a normalized, let's say, around 4 per community per month, that's where we would expect to get to as far as our SG&A levels. Now we're not currently at the 4 per month, but that's where we expect to get to.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Is that something that's realistic to expect by end of year?","Bruce E. Gross","It depends on the market. It's hard to tell. The trend is going in the right direction, whether or not we get to a normalized pace by the end of the year, we'll have to wait and see.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I think in the prepared remarks, it was noted that 45% of unit count that's being sold was purchased on land that was acquired in 2009 or afterwards. I wanted to understand, what do you think by year end that mix shift will be, will it be 50% or 60% or do you have an idea that you could provide us?","Bruce E. Gross","It'll be probably just shy of 50%.","Operator","The next question is coming from David Goldberg of UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question, Stuart, in past conversations and I think on the last call, you talked about mortgage market liquidity. You talked about underwriting standards, and there seemed to be some optimism that underwriting standards might loosen as we look forward. Now it doesn't feel to us like we've seen much change in underwriting in the past 3 months. I'm wondering if you're more optimistic than you've been before that you're going to start to see maybe looser underwriting as we move through the year?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, that's a tricky question, David. You've seen FHA come out with new standards that are really going in the opposite direction where we think there's going to be some tightening down. So it's going to be a mixed picture. I do think we're going to see some reversion to normalized underwriting standards. It wasn't too long ago that someone that didn't have a 700 FICO score just wasn't going to get an approval. And in today's world, we are seeing approvals with lower FICO scores. Now there are a lot more details that go into all of that. But the movement has been in the direction towards a more normalized underwriting standard. With that said, there will be some tightening at the margin. The market will adjust. I think that the driver today relative to mortgages and demand in general is the fact that the appetite for people to move back into for-sale housing is very strong. And customers are starting to alter their credit landscape, their personal credit landscape and whether it means getting some additional savings for additional down payment, getting a gift from parents to afford additional down payment, cleaning up their credit card balances, improving their credit scores, getting past the 2-year window for a short sale or 3-year for a foreclosure. Whatever it is, people are pushing hard today, harder today to fit within the windows of credit standards and credit standards are getting more towards normal. So it's hard to really say that there's going to be loosening or how it's going to loosen. But it seems that the pressure from the market, together with the lending world's moderation is going to get us to a better demand picture.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. My follow-up, and maybe this is for Rick, and realize this is kind of a -- maybe a vague question or difficult question to ask, but a lot of folks are looking at the new land acquisitions and talking about margin trends on new land acquisitions and pricing. I was hoping we could think about bit a different way, of the land that you kind of put under contract of either option or you've bought outright in the last say, x quarters, whatever you want to say, I'm wondering what percentage of it do you think is deemed bought below replacement cost? In other words, the 200 basis point of additional gross margin you're getting on new lots versus old lots, how much of that is just because the market is giving you enough distressed opportunities to buy land below replacement cost? And at some point in the future possibly if we ever saw land prices go back to replacement cost without home price appreciation, that would just come from land prices going up essentially would cut down some of that margin?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, it's a very interesting question because at some point in the cycle, we're going to come across some of the communities where you can buy the asset, still at a price that's lower than what the infrastructure cost is on that's put into that community. But they just don't pencil out yet today. The thing to keep in mind as you look at our land purchases, and this may be different for some of the competitors out there, is the pipeline of activity that we've had, as I highlighted today, these deals that came on in the first quarter were really priced and brought on 2 years ago. So this 3,500, 4,500 homesites of things that really came on in Q1 were priced a long time ago. So were going to get the benefit of that gross margin differential for a while. As we look forward, depending on what is happening in the sales environment and price appreciation, which will come as there's more and more activity and homebuyers are out there, we think it'll get to be more of a normalized land environment where you can make a good building margin and you make your margin, extra margin when you do some development.","Operator","The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani, KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a broader market question. Do you believe new home sales could start to evidence the potential to eventually outperform resales as evidenced either through your results or other major builders? Do you think this is a function of communities that you're able to open in better markets? Because over the past 2 years, we've seen the share of new home sales fall to below historic normal levels, just how do you view this market developing?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, look, we're going to have to let the market unfold a little bit to see how it actually works out, but there are a lot of existing homes on the market right now in secondary locations that are trading at very low prices. There's still a tremendous amount of investor activity in the inner-city and outer city locations that is driving volume of existing home sales. I think that as new homes are developed in and around the pockets of real activity where supply is constrained, new homes will start to regain their footing relative to existing homes. You're right in terms of number, both in terms of number and in terms of pricing, new homes have kind of lagged position relative to existing homes or their historic position relative to existing homes. We think, it feels like that trend is starting to turn a little bit, but we're going to have to give it a little bit of time to see.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on raw materials, a clarification, does your gross margin guidance account for potential price increases you're seeing? And what kind of visibility do have into construction costs a couple of quarters from now?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","As I noted, we believe that with price improvement, our sales price, combined with our purchasing program where we've built in long-lasting value engineered opportunities, that we'll be able to offset that pricing pressure. So we see margins relatively staying in a range as we look forward, 19.5% to 21%, and being able to offset that pressure that you talked about.","Operator","The next question is coming from Jack Micenko of SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Most have been asked and answered. Just wanted to revisit the Rialto REO expense line for a minute. I know it's lumpy. I know it's hard to predict, I know it's -- you don't know what's coming in and it's part of the strategy. But the $12 million number, is that -- I'm trying to figure out how much of that is maybe some catch up or was there an accrual in there? Or should we think about that number being a real number, a real part of the cost structure going forward at least until you begin to slow down and do more restructuring versus REO?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Well, there clearly is a -- this is Jeff. There clearly is a catch-up component to that because when you take title to some of these assets, you do have your prior year taxes that you're going to pay and then there's also improvement cost that you might put in, in order to get the assets ready for sale. So some of that is upfront. Some of that is upfront expense.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","There's no way to quantify what maybe percentage of the mix that would have been in the quarter or anything like that?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","No, not really. But the property tax component, the majority of that does relate to prior year's taxes. So clearly, that's not a recurring piece. But it's a little hard to try to quantify what a run rate is if that's what you're trying to get to.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, that's what we were looking at. And then just real quick as a follow-up, can you compare average down payment and FICO in this quarter on the orders versus maybe a year ago?","Bruce E. Gross","Versus a year ago, there hasn't been much change. It's remained in the low 700s. It's been very consistent over the last year, not much change, and down payment hasn't changed overall for the company average either. It's been very consistent over the last year.","Operator","The next question is coming from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just want to get a better understanding of gross margin. Bruce, was the $2 million of impairments you've mentioned, was that in cost of goods?","Bruce E. Gross","That's all in cost of goods this year. That's correct.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And so if I were to adjust last year's gross margin and this year's gross margin to reflect those and just look at a pre-impairment gross margin year-over-year, looks like it was pretty flat, yet you had some real solid revenue growth and incentives were flat. So I was wondering if you could just address what some of the negative offsets were year-over-year within cost of goods?","Bruce E. Gross","So if you were to strip out the $2 million, the gross margin was 21.3% versus prior year's pre-impairment was 21.1%. So it was at the high end of the range that we've given, and it's up about 20 basis points over last year, if you were to strip out impairments.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. What I was getting at -- I would have expected, given the revenue increase, maybe a little bit more expansion, so I was just wondering what the negative offsets were to the operating leverage on the revenue side?","Bruce E. Gross","So first quarter did increase as far as revenue goes, but I think that's at the high end of the expectations that we had. So I wouldn't really view that there were any negatives that came through this quarter.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can I ask you on backlog, it's the highest it's been really in -- since 2008, and so I would think your ability now to cover your fixed costs out of backlog is going to be a lot improved, and in some ways, that could negate a bit the need to build spec home and do the even floor production a little bit. So I was wondering if, as the backlog stays at this level or continues to grow, should we expect any decline in spec building or decline in backlog turnover?","Bruce E. Gross","Actually, if you look at the statistics I gave this quarter, you did see a decline in terms of the number of homes under construction that are unsold. So we are starting to see that, which is very helpful, because incentives tend to be a little bit lower on homes that are sold before they're started. So this quarter again, there were 1,523 homes under construction that were sold and 2,293 that were unsold. That's a higher percentage of sold homes than we've seen in quite a while.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","This is Jon. If the trend continues and we're able to continue to build backlog and what you're saying, we'll start to see more evidence of we'll be able to grow our margins more effectively, greater backlog and less pressure on moving spec inventory quickly.","Operator","The next question is coming from Megan McGrath, MKM Partners.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. I wanted to ask you a little bit on appraisals, we're hearing from some builders that it does feel like appraisals are moving in your direction, recently maybe because of lower REO inventory. So I'd love to hear your take on that and if that's one of the reasons you feel like you're getting some pricing power back into the market?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","I think in most markets, we are seeing a lessening of the issue with appraisals coming in. There tends to be some differences in markets or in type of appraisal. A VA appraisal is different than some of the other ones. But generally speaking, we are seeing an improvement and less issues at the closing.","Stuart A. Miller","It's kind of a natural phenomenon in the better markets. There are fewer distressed sales to be found nearby, so you're going to have better comps included in the appraisal, and we're definitely seeing less issue with appraisals.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just sort of a bigger picture question. We've heard probably over the past 6 or 9 months about builders sort of shifting away from the first-time buyer and more to the move-up buyer, but some of the comments you make about household formation improving and getting better make me -- and about the anecdotal story about someone moving out of their parent's basement makes me think that the incremental buyer really is the first-time buyer. Is that true? And do you want to stay more focused on the first-time buyer? Or how do you see your product mix changing over the next year?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, we feel that a well-balanced program between both buyer groups is the way to really be because there's going to be constant movement from first to second, and what we're really focused on is finding the right communities for the people that are buying homes, whether it's first or second. There's no question that there is pent-up demand on the first-time buyer program. But you got to be really careful to make sure that you're positioning your product in the right locations and have it priced at a point where they can qualify for those loans.","Stuart A. Miller","And I just want to highlight that we didn't say that they were living in the basement.","Operator","And our last question is coming from Dan Oppenheim, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Was wondering if you can talk a bit about the opportunity for Rialto as you see it. You had the business for several years now. Environment's getting a bit better, credit's more available and more competition out there, how much more do you see in terms of the opportunity for that business and the capital that you have, if you can describe that, start with that?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Yes, I think I -- this is Jeff. I mentioned, I touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks and the fact that in terms of the pressure, a lot of these lenders want to get back into the lending business, and they still have a lot of these assets that are still overhanging. So we see the distressed side of the business on the opportunistic side continuing for some period of time. But while saying that, we also see sort of a reformation of the capital markets and a lot of the skills that Rialto has developed just is very similar to what we did back in the days of LNR. A lot of those skills apply as the markets come out, and as capital market reform in terms of being a liquidity provider and using those same skill sets in terms of making nonperforming loans perform again or dealing with the underlying real estate. So we see it as a growing opportunity. There's still 3 -- there's still, over the next 3 years, $1 trillion of commercial real estate debt that's going to be coming due. And something's got to be done with all of it.","Stuart A. Miller","But with that said, Dan, I think you properly highlight that distress is a depleting opportunity base. And we've recognized that from the beginning. Rialto and its distressed program is a terrific platform on which to build a management team and an operating group that is well prepared to pivot into very different lines of business. You're already seeing that with our entry back into the CMBS business. Within the opportunity fund, we're buying B pieces as we did in the old LNR days. And we're starting to grow new business lines that will take the place of the existing distressed business, but build on the strength of the management team that has been put together in that context.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And I guess one final thing, was wondering in terms of the focus, in terms of the homebuilding operations, when you think about the potential for incremental margins by improvement in absorption versus working to lift pricing in some of these communities, how are you balancing that in terms of just where would you like to get that in terms of the sales per community? Or is it now shifting in terms of, at this level you're pushing more in terms of price versus the absorption?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","This is Jon. It will \u2013 as we've said, it will vary community by community. Where land positions are tight, we'll look to obviously maximize price as much as possible and find that balance of a norm absorption of one a week. To having pricing pressure, I think you'll see as the markets continue to recover, we'll have the ability to both improve pricing and absorptions, but we will look at it on a community-by-community basis to be able to maximize our profitability.","Stuart A. Miller","Okay. So listen, thanks, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter review. I know we took a little bit more time, but we felt that given the way that the national debt is being reported and some of the questions that you all have voiced, it was worth spending a little bit of extra time. If there are additional questions, of course, you can give us a call. We appreciate your attention. Thank you.","Operator","This will conclude today's conference.

Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Good morning everyone. Thank you, David, and thank you all for joining us for our first quarter conference call. This morning, I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you've just heard from; and Diane Bessette. Rick Beckwitt's here with Jeff Krasnoff, our Chief Financial (sic) [Executive] Officer of Rialto; and Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, is on the phone from California and they'll all join in for our Q&A period.","This morning, I'm going to be very brief with my opening remarks as I feel that our views about the market have been consistently expressed on our prior calls. Bruce is going to jump in with our financial detail and then, as always, we'll open up for Q&A. And we'd like to request that during Q&A, as always each person, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","So, let me go ahead and begin and I'll begin by saying that, of course, we're very pleased to report another quarter of performance for Lennar with each of our major segments performing as expected. In spite of some very difficult weather conditions in various parts of the country that have limited both sales and pushed back production, our first quarter results demonstrate that Lennar is very well positioned to continue to perform extremely well in current market conditions and we continue to execute our balanced operating strategy. Consistent with our prior conference call messages, we continue to believe that we are still in the early stages of a protracted, slower-than-history-would-suggest housing recovery, and an early read from this year's spring selling season suggest that the market is continuing to improve at a very steady pace. This recovery continues to be driven forward by a strong backlog of pent-up demand for housing that is constrained by the mortgage market.","Pent-up demand is derived from a now multi-year production deficit that is continuing to grow even at current production levels. At the same time, volume growth has been constrained by overly conservative lending standards, a regulatory environment that discourages mortgage lending and a negative consumer bias overhang against homeownership. Accordingly, we've seen and continue to see outsized improvement in the rental market in terms of low vacancies and higher rental rates. This trend, of course, has benefited our multifamily strategy rather dramatically, but also sets the stage for further improvement in the for-sale market as new households looking for a place to live compare monthly payments.","While the relationship between pent-up demand, rental rates and mortgage availability continues to direct the housing market, it's becoming more apparent that the mortgage market is loosening incrementally with time and enabling more demand to be realized as household formation begins to return to more normalized levels. We have believed and we continue to believe that the downside in the housing market is very limited and the upside is very significant. We believe that the market is downside supported by the many years of production deficits that have yielded a limited supply of both rental and for-sale housing in the country. Any pullback in the housing market would be short-lived as there's a need for shelter across the country and there's very little inventory, and almost no likelihood of mortgage foreclosures given the stringent underwriting standards of the past years.","And while demand has remained constrained by impaired consumer psychology, burdensome mortgage underwriting standards and banking regulations, buyers have continued to steady return to homeownership as the market opens up, driven by low interest rates, defining lower monthly payments versus the cost realities of a higher price and undersupplied rental market.","The recent program changes by FHFA and HUD aimed at bringing buyers back to the market with the consumers' stimulus provided by lower gas prices and employment and wages slowly mending and with lower interest rates driving greater affordability, and with that multi-year deficit in production, the upside in housing continues to seem very large.","Even with the ongoing questions raised about markets like Houston, given the sharp drop in oil prices, there are strong countercurrents to act as partial offsets. Lower gasoline prices and growing consumer confidence are netting an overall stronger market condition to pick up some of the pullback from the oil complex. At 1 million homes of multifamily and single-family production per year, we are continuing to undersupply the demographic needs of the country and this will have to be made up. The shallow slope of this recovery likely provides a steady backdrop for market share expansion in fragmented industry and an extended recovery for those like Lennar who are able to participate by leveraging a strong capital base.","I would suggest that this continues to be a very healthy environment for well-capitalized national builders and for our company in particular. Our results for the first quarter reflect our success in positioning our company across the platform, and I'll let Bruce now give you the detail.","Bruce E. Gross - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Stuart and good morning. Our net earnings for the first quarter increased 47% on a 21% increase in revenues. Revenues from home sales increased 23% in the first quarter, driven by a 20% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $326,000.","Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 23.1%. Just as a reminder, I highlighted in our fourth quarter conference call that our gross margin percentage is expected to be 24% for the full year in 2015, and the first quarter is seasonably the lowest. This quarter was in line with our expectation and we are still on track with our goal of 24% gross margin for the full year. The prior year's gross margin percent of 25.1% included a $5.5 million benefit relating to insurance settlement, which benefited the gross margin percent in the prior year by 50 basis points.","Sales incentives declined sequentially to 6.3% from 6.6% in the fourth quarter, while being flat with last year. The gross margin decline year-over-year was also due to a moderation in pricing power, at the same time as labor, material, and land costs increased. Year-over-year, labor and material costs are up 6.6% to approximately $50 per square foot, but are flat sequentially with the fourth quarter. This flattening represents a focused effort of reducing cost due to commodity declines primarily in copper and steel. We will continue to focus on cost reductions, including those related with petroleum-based products and lumber. However, we are still seeing offsetting labor and manufacturing pressures.","We also saw an increase in cost for manufacturers to comply with stricter environmental regulations, as well as the shortage of transportation in the trucking industry.","SG&A improved 40 basis points year-over-year and approximately 30 basis points of that improvement was due to a reduction in insurance reserves. We have also recognized operating leverage on our corporate G&A line, which improves 10 basis points to 2.7% as a percent of total revenues.","Gross profits on land sales totaled $12.1 million for the quarter versus $16.1 million in the prior year. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated subs was $28.9 million in the first quarter as previously highlighted. This was all driven by El Toro joint venture, selling in 14 neighborhoods, totaling 921 home sites in the next section of El Toro. Lennar will build on four of the 14 neighborhoods, and therefore Lennar's profit of $31.3 million only includes the portion related to the 600 home sites sold to third parties.","Other income was up to $6.3 million this quarter from $2.9 million in the prior year. The increase was due to a club sale at one of our communities that netted a $6.5 million gain. Other interest expense declined year-over-year from $12.7 million in the prior year to $4.1 million in the current year as we continue to open communities and increase the qualifying assets eligible for capitalization. This quarter, we opened 58 new communities to end the quarter with a net of 626 active communities, which is up 14% over the prior year. Our new order dollar value was up 25% and our sales pace was flat year-over-year at 2.8 sales per community per month.","In the first quarter, we purchased 4,200 home sites totaling $421 million versus $505 million in the prior year's quarter. This is consistent with our strategy articulated last year to softly pivot from longer-term land parcels to shorter-term deals. Our home sites owned and controlled now total 163,000 home sites, of which 133,000 are owned.","Our Financial Services business segment had strong results, with operating earnings increasing to $15.5 million from $4.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income increased to $14 million from $6.5 million in the prior year. The increased mortgage earnings were due to higher volume, as mortgage originations increased 84% to $1.6 billion from $886 million in the prior year. The increased volume resulted from a mini-refinancing in the first quarter as well as more home closings by Lennar and a higher capture rate of Lennar homebuyers. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 79% this quarter from 75% in prior year.","In 2014, our mortgage subsidiary expanded its retail channel with the acquisition of Pinnacle Mortgage and by opening branches on the East Coast, and this expansion positioned us well to capitalize on the refinance activity that we did see in the first quarter. Although we don't expect the refinance activity to continue at the same pace as the first quarter, we are well positioned to capture purchase business as the housing recovery continues.","Our title company's profit increased to $2.1 million in the quarter from a loss of $1.6 million in the prior year. And this is primarily due to higher volume and benefits from strategic initiatives, including closing less productive branches over the past year. Our title team continues to focus on maximizing the title opportunities with our ancillary businesses.","Turning to Rialto, the Rialto business segment generated operating earnings totaling $4.6 million compared to $2.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are a net of non-controlling interests. The composition of Rialto's $4.6 million of operating earnings by the three types of investment before G&A and Rialto interest expense are as follows. First, the investment management business contributed $24.4 million of earnings, which includes $2.7 million of equity in earnings from real estate funds and $21.7 million of management fees and other, which included $6.5 million of a carried interest distribution from Rialto real estate funds, and that's to cover the income tax obligation resulting from the allocations of taxable income to Rialto. The carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I under a hypothetical liquidation now stands at $105 million, and that's a footnote which we don't book until we actually receive the cash.","Second, Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $318 million of commercial loans into two securitizations, resulting in earnings of $9.7 million for the quarter before their G&A expenses. And then third, our direct investments had a loss of $2 million for the quarter. And again, we expect most of these direct investments to be monetized by the end of next year.","Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $20.7 million for the quarter. And interest expense excluding our warehouse lines was $6.8 million.","Our Multifamily operations have grown to over 200 associates in regional offices nationwide. We currently have seasoned professionals in divisional offices in Atlanta, Boca Raton, Charlotte, Washington DC, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, Orange County, San Francisco, and Seattle.","We ended the quarter with 24 projects under construction, two of which are in lease-up, totaling over 6,600 apartments, with a total development cost of approximately $1.6 billion. We also have one completed fully leased and operating student housing community that serves the students attending the University of Texas at Austin. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $5.5 billion and over 20,000 apartments.","In the first quarter, we had an operating loss of approximately $5.7 million. And despite this loss, we still expect to be profitable for the full year, benefiting from the sale of about five communities in the last six months of the fiscal year.","As we have discussed in the past, we have been merchant building our apartment communities with third-party institutional capital on a deal-by-deal basis. We are continuing to explore potential financing structures that would allow us to hold our completed and leased apartment communities as a portfolio to capture the recurring income stream from this portfolio.","Turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong in the quarter, as our Homebuilding cash balance ended the quarter at $584 million. We had $250 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. And our leverage improved by 60 basis points year over year as our Homebuilding net debt-to-total capital was reduced to 47.9%.","During the quarter, we added on $250 million to our 4.5% senior notes due November 2019 at a yield of 4.4%, and we continue to reduce our borrowing rate as the company's financial condition strengthens. We grew stockholders' equity to approximately $5 billion at quarter end, and our book value per share increased to $24.13.","And then last, I'd like to summarize what was said on the call regarding goals for 2015 and an update from what we said on our fourth quarter conference call. One, deliveries. We're still on track to deliver between 23,500 and 24,000 homes for 2015. The severe weather conditions in the first quarter have delayed some construction activities, which will slightly reduce our backlog conversion ratio to 80% for Q2 and 80% to 85% for Q3. But we will pick that up and we are increasing our fourth quarter conversion ratio to 95% to 100%.","Second, gross margin. We still expect our gross margins in 2015 to average 24% for the full year, and the gross margins will vary throughout the year depending on product mix with the fourth quarter still expected to be the highest gross margin percent for the year.","Third, we still expect to see 15 basis points to 25 basis points of potential improvement for the SG&A on corporate G&A combined categories.","Fourth, Financial Services. We are increasing our goal for this segment due to the strong refinance environment as the start of the year. We now expect to earn $95 million to $100 million for the full year, but remaining quarterly amounts are expected to be spread similar to the proportions of last year.","Rialto, we still expect a range of profits between $30 million and $40 million for the year and it's heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Multifamily, we are still expecting five buildings to be sold in 2015, all expected in the second half of the year with the 2015 profit still expected to be between $15 million and $18 million and that will depend on the timing of these building sales.","Joint venture and land sales, we still expect to have $10 million of joint venture profit in the second quarter and this is primarily due to our share of the profit from the El Toro land sale to Broadcom which did close in the month of March and that's on track, as we said, last quarter.","There are no other significant transactions in Q3 or Q4 in the JVs and we're on track with approximately $25 million of wholly-owned land sale profit for the year with the bulk of the remaining land profit to be in our fourth quarter.","Our tax rate for 2015 is now expected to do in the mid 34% range and our community count is on target to hit 675 by the end of year. So we are well positioned for this year to deliver strong top line and bottom line growth throughout the year.","And with that, let me turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Bob Wetenhall, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, congratulations everyone. Great start to the spring selling season. I just wanted to ask, your average selling prices on new orders were up 5.5%, which we thought was really good. I wanted to ask you. How are you thinking about balancing price and pace in the current environment? Are you seeing pricing power and how much pushback are you getting from buyers?","Richard Beckwitt - President","Hi, Bob. It's Rick, Rick Beckwitt. We're still continuing to balance price and pace specifically in a couple of markets where demand is really strong and we've got excellent land positions. As you look at the pricing increase year-over-year, a component of that was mix. We had a higher level of deliveries coming from California, some of it was just pure price increase so it's a balance.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And with the order growth that you're seeing right now, and just thinking about Bruce's gross margin guidance of 24%, do you expect the majority of the expansion in gross margin to come from volume-driven operating leverage or is that going to be more a reflection of the growth in average selling prices you're seeing? Thanks very much and good luck.","Bruce E. Gross - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","It's going to be driven by the mix, Bob. It's not going to be driven primarily by average selling price increases.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks very much.","Bruce E. Gross - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","We get a higher a level of field absorption, so some of it is volume-driven, Bob.","Operator","Next question from Haendel St. Juste, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning. Anyone there? All right. We ought to go onto the next one.","Operator","Michael Rehaut, JPMC. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone and congrats on a solid quarter. First question I had was on Houston. Did the 7% decline in orders \u2013 obviously, you still had a great overall order growth number, also noticed the 4% drop in Southeast Florida. Perhaps you could talk about those two regions in terms of was that more community count-driven. We were just through Houston and saw a little bit of perhaps the slower pace in February, but really did very, very much by sub-market and positioning, et cetera. But any comments on Houston and for that matter, Southeast Florida, what was driving the order trends during the quarter would be helpful?","Richard Beckwitt - President","Okay, this is Rick. First, let's talk about Houston because I know it's in everybody's thoughts right now. I'd tell you that across the board, we had good traffic in all price points. Definitely stronger traffic and absorption at the sub $350,000 price point; real, real strong between $200,000 and $300,000. As you got above the $400,000, $500,000 price point, it's slowing down.","Traffic is still strong. The buyers there are just more cautious in pulling the trigger on the sales side. But we really think that the Houston market is a strong market. We decided not to chase prices down and focus more on gross margin in Houston. We're very positive on the Houston market.","With regard to Southeast Florida, that really is just the timing of communities. If you look at the average sales price, it was up 9% year-over-year in the market that we chose to focus more on pricing power there as opposed to sales absorptions.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. No, that's very helpful. I guess just second question on pricing and incentives, broadly speaking. We've heard that the spring is off generally speaking to a solid start; obviously your comments echo that. At the same time, given how 2014 for many builders was a little bit of an uneven year, I think at this point from what we understand, builders are still a little bit hesitant to exact any material price increases or dial back incentives. But perhaps as the spring progresses, if there's still kind of a solid pace that you could see that a little bit more into April and May, is that kind of similar to what you're seeing in the market and an approach that you might take if you continue to see overall \u2013 the solid start to the spring progress?","Richard Beckwitt - President","Mike, I go back to the scene that I have advanced pretty much quarter-after-quarter. And now for the past few years, and that is that we're operating in this kind of narrow channel of improvement that's defined by a production deficit across the country and constrained mortgage availability. So, you have demand pushing up, you've got constraint pushing down, and all of this is happening with inventories very, very tight across the country, both on the existing and the new home and the rental side of the equation.","So the market condition generally has been choppy. It's been moving inside the channel, a little bit up, a little bit down and you're seeing some of that. And of course, as you go through the first quarter, you've seen some rather severe weather conditions in a number of parts of country that have really limited the ability of buyers to get out of their home and go look for a home if they're even inclined to. And you've not just seen that in the Northeast where it's been kind of most aggressively articulated. It's in Dallas. It's been in Atlanta. We've had weather conditions in a number of places across the country.","So even in the context of some constraining weather conditions, the market is still presenting itself and early signs of the spring are showing themselves to be steady improvement in the marketplace continuing along that trajectory of an improving, recovering housing market constrained by the mortgage market, limited inventories and still primarily defined by a production deficit that has been growing over the years that is pushing where pent-up demand is pushing production upward.","We think this is a terrific tailwind for the industry and as we look ahead to the spring selling season, we're going to be balancing price and pace as we have done in a very methodical way. I think most builders will be doing the same. And while the market might move up, might move down a little bit, we see steady improvement.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Next question from Haendel St. Juste, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Sorry about the technical difficulties earlier.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So wanted to ask about the absorption pace. How did that spread throughout quarter and how is it turning currently? And can you talk about what buyer segments are currently driving the orders and the absorption growth?","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me ask Jon to lay in on that.","Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President","Well, as you would expect in our first quarter, we saw sequentially for the months order pace improve as you move from December, January into February. And then as we've been saying, it's really submarket by submarket \"saw\" the strongest absorption improvements in the coastal markets, particularly places like California, parts of Florida up into the Carolinas, which is what we expect as we've seen looking backwards in this recovery as the coastal market seem to be outperforming from an absorption standpoint.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, I appreciate that. On the deliveries beat, was that just driven by higher demand for spec or the platform just running better maybe perhaps than you expected during the quarter?","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a combination of the two.","Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Next question from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates, your line is open.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Hey, guys. Good morning. It's Alan on for Ivy, and congrats on the quarter. First question, Rick, I was hoping maybe just to follow up quickly on the Southeast Florida orders there. The order pace this quarter was well below where you've been running in the back half of last year. And you mentioned the timing effect there from some communities. If we look at the trends through 2014, it looks like you had a similar drop-off in 1Q, and then activity ramps pretty significantly through the remainder of the year there. So as you think about the pipeline of community openings in that market specifically, should we expect to see a similar trend this year, or is this kind of first quarter run rate just based on your pipeline a more realistic run rate through the year?","Richard Beckwitt - President","Some of it's going to be \u2013 it's really dependent on when we can get the big communities open. We went through some rather large, high productive communities last year, and we've got similar battleships opening this year throughout Southeast Florida. Unfortunately, right now there, we're getting the models open, getting the monuments, the entries opened, and it's going to be probably a couple of quarters until that pace picks back up. But as we move into 2016, you'll see a lot of activity coming from Southeast Florida. It will still be a really good year, high margins, just a little bit on the flat side for the year.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Got it, I appreciate that color. And second, Stuart, there have been some articles written about a community opened recently in Nevada geared towards rentals on the single-family side. So I was curious if you can give some color there about what the company strategy is, whether this is a one-off, or whether that's a business you're looking to get into.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, as you know, we started years ago focusing on the rental component of the market, recognizing that the mortgage constraint would play a big role in the way that the housing market would recover. Frankly, we didn't anticipate that the regulatory environment would constrain the mortgage market as much as it has. And as the market has presented, we've continued to grow a rather sizable apartment rental business. We've built a platform that, as Bruce articulated, is very large across our geography. And we're not only pleased with the $5.5 billion pipeline that we've put together, and we think that even to our underwriting we're seeing upside just based on low vacancies and high rental rates.","The inability of the American family to access the mortgage market is really developing an appetite for single-family product, though it might have to be realized in a rental format. And so we are experimenting with that format as a hybrid between our for-sale and our multifamily apartment community program. And it has received a little bit of publicity, but we are building our first such community to see what the acceptance is in the marketplace. Whether it becomes part of a trend, whether it becomes part of a program going forward, we have yet to see. But as is typical with us, we are innovative. We like to think of ourselves as thinking a little bit outside the box, forward thinking, and we think that this community could be representative of somewhat of a trend in the country, and we'll wait and see.","From an upside standpoint, we look at the community as a rental opportunity that can be very interesting. On the downside, if the rental concept doesn't work as well as we'd like, we can always convert to a for-sale platform. So it's really right in our wheelhouse to be working on this, and we think it presents a really unique and interesting opportunity for the future.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates","Sounds exciting, good luck.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Next question from Stephen East, Evercore ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Stuart, you've talked a few times about mortgages, et cetera. I guess a compound question here. One, who's really providing the mortgages as you look across the country? Is this coming from the bigger guys in the world or is it just the smaller guys and non-banks?","And then if you just look at what you think the market \u2013 what type of growth rates the market could support this year, say, over the next 12 months or so, what's limiting factor? Is it the mortgage availability, or would it be more on the land or labor? How do you all look at it right now?","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","First of all, as it relates to the mortgage market, Stephen, there's clearly somewhat of a shift going on. The traditional banking world is really constrained in its view of the mortgage market and the regulatory environment. But really that regulatory environment spreads or is equally applied across the mortgage platform. Even if you're an unconventional lender, you have to look at the regulations around mortgage origination and some of the punitive constraints of the environment as a limiting factor. And it's not just at the origination point; it's all the way through to the servicing platforms out there.","So the mortgage market, even though we're seeing that originations are finding their way across smaller lenders and less traditional lenders in the market at large, it doesn't move the needle dramatically to see the shift from big banks to others in terms of healing the mortgage market. It's more about the regulatory environment softening, the punitive side being softened and lenders just feeling their way through this kind of turbulent landscape. So I still view the mortgage landscape as the primary limiting factor.","Now a secondary limiting factor, because we have been constrained in production, the land development machine has not reemerged in this housing recovery in full force. So it takes time to get land entitled. I keep going back to the fact that there is a land shortage, and that means entitled developed land is in short supply. So if you see an uptick in the marketplace, land will continue to be a constraining factor.","And then the question of materials and labor, I think they're subsidiary questions. I think to the extent that demand reveals itself, labor can be sourced with higher wages, materials. There are clearly some constraints on the trucking side and maybe the import markets are little bit more complicated. But I think your primary constraining factors are the mortgage market number one, and then land number two.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay, thanks. And then the other question I had, if you look at really two things. One, your apartment sales that you got coming in the back half, if you could, give us a rundown on location and what you think the general cap rate will be. And then what you think your cash flows \u2013 are you cash flow neutral this year? Do you turn positive in 2016 with the soft pivot, and how much of it would probably revolve around the sales of the apartments?","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","First of all, Steve, I want to recognize that you're asking compound questions, which really kind of defeat the policy of one question.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","I've got to squeeze them in somehow.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's right. So in terms of apartment sales, I'm not going to give specific cap rates and sale numbers. What I will say is that our performance in the apartment segment is defined by low vacancies, higher rental rates than we had originally underwritten. And as we look to sell apartment communities, just remember that we are in partnership in those apartment community, so we don't have the complete unilateral ability to define a sell and define the exact timing of that sale.","So this is going to unfold and we've been very cautious about describing the parameters around how sales will actually happen because we recognize it's an imperfect landscape right now. And of course, in order to model it, you who do will analyze what we're trying to do. We're looking for some certainty as to how many and what the cap rate is and what the profitability will be. And we've realized there is a little tug and pull there. We're trying to give you some general parameters recognizing that the specifics are going to define themselves at that time. And as we go through some of our sales, we'll start to develop some more specific parameters, which will be helpful to you when we get into 2016.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Okay, fair enough.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then the second part of that compound question was?","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","Just looking at your cash flows for this year and next year.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Bruce, do you want to talk about that?","Bruce E. Gross - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Sure. So as we've been saying, we think 2015, we are going through the soft pivot. So depending on some of the timing of some of the land acquisitions, we're getting to a point where by the end of this year, we think we'll be in a position of turning positive cash flow and into next year. And most of that is driven by the soft pivot because the ancillary businesses as you go through this year are pretty much self-funding. We're putting a little bit more into Multifamily this year. But we expect as we get into 2016, those businesses will be returning cash and self-funding. So the soft pivot is what's going to be driving us to get to cash flow positive as we get towards the end of this year.","Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI","All right, I appreciate all the help. Thank you, guys.","Bruce E. Gross - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Next question from Stephen Kim, Barclays. Your line is open.","James Morrish - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, guys. This is actually Trey on for Steve. Going back and touch a little bit on the mortgage market that you guys have talked about a few times, you actually, early May, published some FICO and DTI data regarding February with both tightening on the margin. Do you believe this is representative of what's currently going on in the underwriting market or do you think this is more a reflection of people walking through the door? And are you seeing similar trends coming from your customers?","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I saw that. I don't know really what to make of it. It seems fairly \u2013 it seems that the data that's reported is really kind of it's within a range. I don't know that we \u2013 I don't know that I could see a trend from that. It seems to us as we look at our book of business that still \u2013 that the mortgage market is opening at a margin. And the fact that FICO scores might move a little bit one way or another I think is all part of that process of one step forward, two steps back, but gently improving as we go forward. So, I just don't know that I would read too much into that data.","James Morrish - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, thanks for that. Now, speaking to your ancillary businesses a little bit, could you talk about the recent departures at Rialto and what most excited you about that business? And also regarding FivePoint, what do you consider the timing for the next group of lot sales to be released there?","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Let me let Jeff talk about the departures and then we'll talk about FivePoint.","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff - Chief Executive Officer, Rialto Capital Management","This is Jeff. And as far as the departures go, I think it could go probably a lot more for us than really what the price made a bigger deal of it than it really was at the end of the day. And we have about 400 folks in Rialto, the team that was \u2013 that left has already been replaced most of it, almost a 100% of it internally with a group of individuals that have been growing up in the business and actually been in the business even longer. So from that perspective, we're feeling really good about it in terms of where we are.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me just add to that. I think if you look at the markets in which Rialto operates, most of the participants are groups that have been homegrown here within the Lennar environment. Jeff and his senior management team are, I would say, the educators of the industry and I would say that we have the recipe here. Some of the ingredients sometimes leave the building, but we can replace the ingredients. And we have a great and stable program at Rialto that continues to move forward. I wouldn't read too much into the departure of any one or any few associates either in the Rialto platform or the Lennar platform and again, as Jeff said, I think the press made a lot of much ado about very little. Let me turn to Jon to answer the part about FivePoint.","Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Stuart. We're very excited where FivePoint is positioned right now. Most of the activity is occurring at El Toro in Orange County. We reported sales have gone extremely well in the first phase which is virtually sold out now. We reported closing to builders of most of the villages in the second phase in our first quarter. The last two villages, we expect to close this quarter with the builders starting their models and production this quarter and a grand opening sometime mid-summer.","We also just closed at the beginning of this quarter commercial transaction with Broadcom that we're very excited about bringing a commercial component on into El Toro. And we expect the next major section of El Toro to come to market at the end of the year, probably will fall into our first quarter for fiscal 2016.","And activity continues to go very strongly up in San Francisco at Hunters Point, the shipyard. We're sold out of our first buildings there, first 88 homes and we'll be releasing our next homes in the coming couple months and continue to start more construction at that site, as well as we announced our large joint venture with Macerich to develop a large retail mall there, which has spurred a lot of interest from other commercial players in our activity there. And we did commence deconstruction of Candlestick Park this quarter and we'll have that completed by next quarter.","James Morrish - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys. It's very helpful.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","Next question from Jade Rahmani, KBW. Your line is open.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On Rialto, I wanted to also ask about if you could provide an update on your thinking regarding what you might eventually choose to do with that business, whether it'd be spin-off sale or combination with another entity. It seems that in the current regulatory environment with the Basel III, increased capital requirements for banks in the Dodd-Frank risk retention rules that go into effect late next year. Non-banking platforms like Rialto should stand to benefit and also should see not only market growth opportunities, but interest from other players. So want to see if you could an update on how you're thinking about it.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, listen. Jade, part of our thesis with Rialto was, as we've grown it, has definitely marched along the lines of recognizing that the constraints around the banking industry presented a distinct opportunity for our Rialto platform, and we're pretty enthusiastic about the prospects for future.","To the first part of your question, we have built Rialto as distinct from when we built LNR in the 1990s. We built Rialto as a segregated segment with a full complement of management team that was disentangled from the Lennar platform. It was designed to be built with full optionality. As we developed maturity in the business, we would have the ability to either spin to IPO, to combine, to sell, to do any number of things.","As we look at Rialto today, given its current maturity, given the prospects for its future, it's a platform that we continue to like having the ability to hold within the company and wait for the right next move to present itself. So we don't feel any urgency in doing something immediately with that segment. We think that it continues its progression of coming right along with a tremendous opportunity set in front of it. And there will be an intersection of a right next move for Rialto as we continue to grow it and as the market continues to ripen and present itself. So think about it in terms of having an excellent operating platform with perfect optionality to be able to realize its maximum value as the market recognizes what its potential is. And that's exactly how we think about it, and we couldn't be happier with the way it's positioned.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great, thanks for that. Just a small follow-up on the risk retention rules. Since Rialto is buying B-pieces at this point through funds, I just wanted to get clarification on whether that would meet the risk retention requirements.","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff - Chief Executive Officer, Rialto Capital Management","Jade, it's Jeff. As we understand them, it would. It clearly would. And we believe that in terms of how we're positioned and in terms of the types of investors that we have, we're expecting that to be an advantage for us as we go forward and when the rules actually begin from there.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think that like the mortgage, the residential mortgage environment, risk retention rules across all asset classes are continuing to evolve. I think the initial intent or the initial concept of risk retention proved to be a limiting factor to the evolution of markets. And in order to keep markets moving and working properly, those rules have had to morph. As we sit right now, we think we're a beneficiary of whatever those risk retention rules are because we have the unique ability to match up special servicing with the acquisition of the underlying collateral of the B-piece. And so however it evolves, we'll be compliant and we'll be a primary engine.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Next question from Adam Rudiger, Wells Fargo Securities.","Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, this is Joey Matthews on for Adam. My question is probably for Rick or Jon in regards to your mothballed asset strategy. You said last quarter you expect about 10% of your deliveries this year to be from those previously mothballed assets. I'm wondering what percentage of your deliveries in Q1 were from those previously mothballed assets and how any difficulties you're having developing that land to get it ready to open communities.","Richard Beckwitt - President","We're looking at the number right now, but my guess is it's somewhere around that 10% number.","Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President","Just a little below 10%, 8% to 10%.","Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then...","Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President","And...","Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Go ahead.","Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President","...there are really no difficulties in bringing those online. We've been making sure that we're on top of keeping entitlements in place, land ready to go. So as the market recovers, they're in existing divisions. We're able to, we've got product in our portfolio and able to methodically bring those online.","Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And since those are probably in B and C locations, I would guess. How have absorptions in those communities progressed this quarter?","Richard Beckwitt - President","Jon?","Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President","Consistent with the marketplace. Sometimes they're in B and C locations, sometimes a little bit better just depending on when they were acquired. We held on to mostly our better locations as we went through the liquidation of many of those assets in the downturn, particularly with our large transaction. So we're finding that they perform fairly consistently with other communities in those areas, and we're not experiencing any activity that are really in far outreaching areas. So I don't have any color on something that would be in a true tertiary market.","Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, and why don't we go ahead and take our last question?","Operator","Your last question from Michael Dahl, Credit Suisse, your line is open.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thanks. I wanted to go back to \u2013 I think Rick made a comment earlier in response to a Houston comment and make sure we understood the context around it. You said you chose not to chase pricing down. Is that a comment relating to just your mix of communities not shifting towards the lower end, or competitively were you seeing more discounting in that market?","Richard Beckwitt - President","A lot of times when you have a bunch of builders in a market where there's a lot \u2013 there's headline oil everyday in the paper, some of the smaller, less capitalized builders get nervous with regard to what they do with inventory. We've taken the position that we've got great quality assets in the right locations, so there's no reason to adjust pricing just because other builders that maybe in tertiary areas are bringing their prices down. So we've just chosen to focus more on margin than on pace.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah.","Richard Beckwitt - President","That smoke should clear out at some point. And actually, we view it long term \u2013 medium term as an advantage for us because we're starting to see some of the land parcels that were under contract by other folks come back to the market or people walking away from deals. And as Stuart had said in the past, a lot of times distress or perceived distress is where we really excel.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Okay, that is helpful. Secondly, I think, Bruce, in some of your opening remarks, you made some references to focused efforts on some of the material costs. And I guess from manufacturers, you've kind of heard mix. Some are still staying hey, our feedstock cost hasn't really flowed through to us yet. So could you give any more color on just how those conversations are going and how much success you are having or expect?","Bruce E. Gross - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Let me turn it over to Jon to answer that one.","Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President","I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question, please? I apologize.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","The question was around just efforts to reduce some of the input cost dependent materials that you guys use and how the conversations are going with manufacturers given some of them are still trying to claim lower feedstock hasn't flowed through to them yet.","Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President","From our vantage point, we're achieving success on one hand with manufacturers and then having headwinds on another side of the equation. The success has been with the drop in copper cost, steel cost that flow through the manufacturers. What's really been offsetting that is some new regulation that's occurred, particularly on the environmental front.","So for example, the Department of Energy passed new regulation at the end of last year that require side-by-side refrigerator freezers to be 25% more efficient. So that requires them to use more the material in making the product. So we end up with an offset. We're really not seeing any cost savings, but we are seeing not the same increase what we would have seen just been their compliance with the new regulation. Seen the same thing with HVAC, windows, water heaters all subject to new regulation.","So, we are \u2013 it's a daily focus for us. We work with the national manufacturers, with local suppliers, local trades to find every opportunity. Now, when you look at as a percentage of what we \u2013 of our build cost, copper, steel are not that bigger percentage. Lumber, which is a bigger percentage, we have seen that come down recently and do expect to see some benefit from that in our second, third and fourth quarters. But again, you have other cost such as concrete and drywall that continue to have some pressure on them.","Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you.","Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, very good. Thanks, everyone, for joining.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end update. This morning, I am joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer and Dave Collins, who you just heard from, Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Rick Beckwitt, our President and Jon Jaffe, Chief Operating Officer, are here as well and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto. They are all going to join in for question-and-answer.","As is customary on our conference call, I am going to begin with some brief overview remarks on the housing market and our operations and then Bruce is going to jump in with greater detail. As always, we will open up to Q&A and we would like to request that during Q&A, each person limit themselves to one question and one follow-up.","So let me go ahead and begin and let me begin by saying that we are very pleased to report another very solid quarter of performance for Lennar with each of our major segments performing better than expected. Our fourth quarter and year-end results demonstrate that our company is very well positioned to continue to perform extremely well in current market conditions and to continue to execute our carefully crafted and balanced operating strategy.","Generally speaking, we continue to believe that we are still in the early stages of a protracted slow growth housing recovery. The recovery continues to be driven forward by increased pent-up demand derived from a now multiyear production deficit and the increasingly high monthly cost of rentals. At the same time, volume growth has been constrained by overly conservative lending standards, a regulatory environment that discourages mortgage lending by banks and a negative bias overhang against homeownership.","Complicating matters, the housing recovery has been somewhat erratic as macroeconomic factors have continued to both positively and negatively affect that recovery. As I have said before, this market has continued a slow and steady recovery that is markedly different from past down cycle recoveries. I noted in our last conference call that history would suggest a more vertical recovery especially given the severity of the economic decline. This recovery has had a decidedly different trajectory as the slope of recovery has been shallow and the recovery has been choppy and volatile.","While the reflection of the market has been confounding to many, we have had a very clear understanding that has informed our company strategy. Simply put, we believe and continue to believe that the downside in the housing market is very limited and the upside is very significant. We believe that the market is downside supported by many years of production deficits, which has yielded a limited supply of both rental and for-sale housing in the country. Any pullback in housing volume would be short-lived as there is a need for shelter in the country and there is very little inventory with almost no likelihood of mortgage foreclosures, given the stringent underwriting standards of the past years.","And while demand has remained constrained by impaired consumer psychology, burdensome mortgage underwriting standards and banking regulations that discourage mortgage lending, buyers have been steadily returning to homeownership as the market opens up driven by the cost realities of a high priced and undersupplied rental market. With recent pronouncements by FHFA and HUD aimed at bringing buyers back to the market, with the consumer stimulus provided by lower gas prices, with employment and wages slowly mending, with lower interest rates driving greater affordability and with that multiyear deficit in production, the upside in housing remains ahead of us.","Even with questions raised about markets like Houston, given the drop in oil prices and foreign purchasers, given the strong dollar, there are strong countercurrents to act as an offset. At a million homes of multifamily and single-family production per year, we are continuing to undersupply the longer-term needs of the country and this will have to be made up. The shallow slope of this recovery likely provides a steady backdrop for market share expansion in a fragmented industry and an extended recovery duration for those who are able to participate by leveraging a strong capital base.","I would suggest that this is a very healthy environment for the well-capitalized national builders and for Lennar in particular. Our results for 2014 reflect our success in navigating this landscape and we believe that we are well positioned for strong results in 2015 and beyond. A combination of solid management execution of our articulated strategies and strategic investments in core assets combine to produce strong results and will enable continued industry-leading performance throughout next year.","Homebuilding, of course, remains the primary driver of our company performance [indiscernible] that is driving this performance this quarter were job growth and encouraging dialogue regarding mortgage underwriting, while the headwinds remain a challenging mortgage approval process and aggressive competitor incentives. Lennar's execution strategy remain balancing price and pace on a community-by-community basis to maximize our results and continuing our soft pivot towards the slower growth and land-lighter program.","The execution of this strategy produced 22% sales growth, 25.6% gross margin and a 16% operating margin. Our operating margin for the full year of 14.9% matches our company high from 2005. Our sales pace in the fourth quarter was three sales per community per month and this was flat with 2013 fourth quarter pace by 2.9 and still is not enough to drive the operating leverage that should come from increased absorption. Nevertheless, fourth quarter SG&A was 9.6% and a 30 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our average sales price increased 7% year-over-year to $329,000. During the quarter, we opened 75 new communities and closed up [indiscernible] communities to end at 625 active communities or 16% year-over-year increase.","Year-over-year, labor and material costs are up 7% to $50 a square foot. This represents the slowing of the pace of cost increases from a 10% plus year-over-year run rate the past two years and that's before the recent fall of oil prices. With oil prices down, we should see cost and petroleum-based products such as roots single and asphalt come down as well as broader reductions from the overall positive impact of lower transportation costs. Additionally, the reduction in costs in copper and other commodities should add to cost reductions in the future. Remember, however, that increases are quick to be passed on while decreases are difficult and time-consuming to realize.","With many of our competitors offering large incentives to drive sales, sales incentives grew 6.6% for the quarter compared to 6.3% last year and 5.8% last quarter. Our realtor expense was 2.8% of revenues compared to 2.5% last year. We continued to strategically use incentives and\/or increased brokerage fees on specific communities where we thought the sales pace [indiscernible] selectively marketing more aggressively to both brokerage community and consumers on communities as needed.","As we have noted before, our sales and margins continue to benefit from our Next Gen offering. For the quarter, our Next Gen product had a year-over-year growth rate of 38%. We now offer Next Gen plans in 205 communities in 14 of our 17 states, with an average sales price 23% above our company average.","Our homebuilding operating results for 2014 really speak for themselves. As we look to 2015, while we expect to see some margin contraction due to competitive pressures and the inclusion of some additional legacy land assets in our product offering, our homebuilding operating platform is well positioned to continue to drive strong profitability for the company.","Of course, complementing our homebuilding operations, our financial services segment continued to build its primary business alongside the homebuilder while continuing to also grow our retail platform. Bruce will talk more about our financial services progress which has had a very respectable quarter with operating earnings of $30.2 million, which is a 78% improvement over to $17 million last year.","While our homebuilding and financial services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our three additional operating divisions are all continuing to mature as excellent longer-term value creation platforms for the company. Our multifamily operation has grown to 157 associates and regional offices nationwide. We currently have seasoned professional and division offices in Atlanta, Boca Raton, Charlotte, Washington DC, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, Orange County, San Francisco and Seattle.","We ended the year with 22 apartment communities under construction, three of which are in lease up, totaling over 6,000 apartments, with a total development cost of approximately $1.4 billion. We also have one completed fully leased and operating student housing community that serves the students attending the University of Texas at Austin. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $5 billion and over 20,000 apartments.","In 2014, we sold our first two apartment communities and given the construction schedule of our pipeline. We are positioned to sell another five communities in the back half of 2015. With these sales and our management, construction and development fees, our multifamily business should generate between $15 million and $18 million of pretax earnings in fiscal year 2015.","As we have discussed in the past, we have been merchant building our apartment communities with third-party institutional capital on a deal-by-deal basis. As we move into 2015, we are looking to create a multifamily fund that would allow us to both develop and hold our completed and leased apartment communities as a portfolio in order to capture the recurring income stream from the portfolio. We are cautiously optimistic that we can take our apartment programs in the next level and create longer-term shareholder value from this platform.","In the fourth quarter, Rialto produced operating earnings of $38.2 million reflecting our continued progress in transitioning from an asset heavy balance sheet investor to a capital light investment manager and commercial loan originator and securitizer. Rialto has now returned over $400 million of invested capital to the parent company just since last year and we expect to generate at least another $250 million of cash from our initial direct investments for us to recycle by the end of 2016. Our investment management and servicing platforms have been growing assets under management where we have a very strong asset base from which we are harvesting value for investors and for our company.","We are continuing to build upon the base established with our first two real estate fund. Fund I became fully invested in early 2013 and in less than two years, our investors already have received well over 100% of their invested capital back from income and monetizations and with the distribution of carried interest this quarter, we now have about 1.5 times our investment with a lot more to go. Fund II has already invested or committed to invest approximately $1.2 billion of equity in 75 transaction and also continues to make current distributions of income to investors that, to-date, have exceeded over 18%.","We still have almost $400 million of equity to invest and expect to begin raising our third real estate fund later this year. And to complement our real estate fund, we also have almost $500 million of equity to investor led mezzanine lending. We have an outstanding investment team that is extremely well positioned to continue to build our asset management business.","Additionally, Rialto mortgage finance, our high return equity lending platform is originating and securitizing long-term fixed rate loan on stabilized cash flow in commercial real estate properties. During the quarter, we completed our 12 securitization transaction selling over $500 million of RMF originated loans, maintaining our strong margins and bringing our total to $2.2 billion in only our first five quarters of operation.","Finally, our FivePoint communities program continues to make significant progress in developing our premium California master-planned communities. At Heritage Fields or El Toro, builders in the first phase of 726 homesites have sold 660 homes, over 90% of the homes released for sale with strong pricing power and pace through the fourth quarter. FivePoint has entered into contracts on the second phase with nine builders for 14 neighborhood with 916 homesites.","Lennar will build 253 homes in four of the neighborhoods along with eight of the builders. The land sales will close in the first quarter and Lennar will recognize approximately $30 million of income from these sales in that period.","Additionally, FivePoint entered into a contract to sell 73 acres of land to Broadcom Corporation for the relocation of their headquarters to the Great Park neighborhood. They plan to build a campus with two million square foot of office space. The profit from this transaction will be recognized in Lennar's second quarter.","At Newhall, we anticipate to begin land development later this year as Newhall success in monetizing non-core assets has allowed the venture to maintain a significant cash position of approximately $185 million at year-end. And in San Francisco, sales continue to be very strong at the shipyard. We are now just about sold out of our first phase of 88 home that will begin closing in March. There are an additional 159 homes under construction, most of which will deliver in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Also in the fourth quarter, we closed a joint venture with Macerich, a retail REIT, to develop a 500,000 square-foot regional mall on the site of the Candlestick Park Stadium. The mall, along with an additional 180,000 square feet of retail space, is expected to open in the beginning of 2018.","Overall and in summary, our company has been busy and our company is extremely well positioned to thrive in the current market conditions. The shallow slope of recovery with what we believe will be an extended duration, provides an excellent environment for our management team to drive our business forward, pick up market share and produce excellent results. Over the past quarters, we have been articulating a soft pivot to a land-lighter model in homebuilding and an asset light model for our ancillary businesses. These initiatives are becoming a core strategy for our company as we develop a carefully refined asset allocation program for our now matured business lines and focus on cash generation and deleveraging our balance sheet.","As we move through 2015, we expect to amplify the company focus on moderating growth, focusing on ROIC and driving cash flow as we enter the back half of 2015 and into 2016. We have an excellent management team that continues to be focused on our carefully crafted strategy. This team has positioned Lennar with advantage to assets that will continue to drive profitability in our core homebuilding and financial services business line. Additionally, we have developed a well diversified platform that will continue to enhance shareholder value as our ancillary businesses continued to mature. Today, we are proud to share our results for fiscal 2014 and we look forward to sharing our further progress as we move into a new year.","With that, let me turn over to Bruce.","Bruce Gross","Thanks, Stuart and good morning. Our net earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.07 per diluted share versus $0.73 per share in the prior year. I will provide some additional color to the numbers starting with homebuilding.","Our gross margin on home sales was 25.6% compared with 26.8% in the prior year, however, this exceeded our fourth quarter gross margin goal discussed on our last conference call. The gross margin improved sequentially by 40 basis points, however, declined 120 basis points year-over-year due to a moderation in pricing power as labor, material and land costs increased.","Sales incentives increased by 30 basis points to prior year to 6.6% as a percentage of home sale revenue. The gross margin percentage for the quarter remained highest in the East, Southeast Florida and West regions. Additionally, we had a $5.8 million benefit to the gross margin during the quarter relating to Chinese drywall settlements. In addition to the 30 basis points improvement in our SG&A, we have also recognized operating leverage on our corporate G&A line which improved by 10 basis points to 2.2% as a percent of total revenues.","The combined categories of land sale income, joint venture profit and other income, netted to $14.4 million of profit this year versus $22.1 million in the prior year. Other interest expense declined 75% year-over-year from $20.5 million in the prior year to $5.2 million in the current quarter, as we continued to open communities and increase the qualifying assets eligible for capitalization. As Stuart mentioned, we opened 75 new communities to end the year at 625 active communities. This is at the high end of the goal that we provided to 2014 and a 16% increase over 2013.","We purchased 4,400 home sites during the quarter, totaling $254 million. Our total land acquisition spend for the full year in 2014 declined by 21% to $1.4 billion from $1.8 billion in 2013. This is consistent with the strategy that Stuart articulated to softly pivot from longer-term land parcels to shorter-term deals. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 165,000 homesites, of which 133,000 are owned and 32,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory at quarter-end is carefully managed averaging 1.5 homes per community at 948 homes.","Turning to financial services. They had a strong quarter with operating earnings increasing to $30.2 million from $17 million in the prior year. The increased earnings was due to higher volume and higher profit per transaction in both the mortgage and title operations. The mortgage pretax income increased to $23.9 million from $14.3 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations increased 52% to $2 billion from $1.3 billion in the prior year. The increased volume was a result of higher home closings by Lennar, a higher capture rate of Lennar homebuyers and the expansion of our retail platform. The capture rate improved to 80% this quarter from 75% in the prior year.","Our title company's profit increased to $6.9 million in the quarter from $3.4 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher profit per transaction. Our title team continues to focus on maximizing the title opportunities within our ancillary businesses.","Turning to Rialto. The composition of Rialto is $38.2 million of operating earnings by the three types of investments before G&A and Rialto interest expense are as follows. First, the investment management business contributed $66.5 million of earnings which includes $16 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $50.5 million of management fees and other. The $50.5 million includes $34.7 million of a carried interest distribution from Rialto Fund I. This was the first collection of funds pertaining to the carried interest which was distributed to cover the income tax obligation which resulted from allocations of taxable income to Rialto. The carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I, under a hypothetical liquidation, increased by approximately $22 million for the quarter. After the 34.7 million distribution, the carried interest is now at $110 million.","Second, our new Rialto mortgage finance operations contributed $510 million of commercial loans into three securitizations, resulting in earnings of $19.2 million for the quarter before their G&A expenses.","Third, our direct investments, which primarily are being monetized, had a profit of $200,000 and we will continue to liquidate these direct investments as we go forward. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $40.2 million for the quarter and interest expense relating to the senior notes was $7.4 million. Rialto ended the year with a strong liquidity position with over $200 million of cash.","Turning to the multifamily segment. There were no apartment building sales expected during the fourth quarter and their results reflect startup costs associated with the buildout of our construction pipeline, which positions us well for a profitable 2015. Our investment in multifamily is approximately $200 million and we continue to grow this business primarily using third-party capital.","Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 33.8% and for the year, it was 34.8%. The rate was favorably impacted by the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction which is now available to us since we have utilized our federal net operating losses in various tax credits.","Turning to the balance sheet. 2014 was another year of balance sheet strengthening. Our liquidity improved as our homebuilding cash balance improved by almost $200 million with no outstanding borrowings under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at year-end. Our leverage improved by 150 basis points as our homebuilding net debt to total cap was reduced to 44.1%. We grew stockholders' equity by $658 million to $4.8 billion and our book value per share increased to $23.54.","During the quarter, we paid off $250 million of maturing 5.5% senior notes and issued $350 million of 4.5% senior notes due 2019. We continue to reduce our borrowing rate as the company's financial condition strengthens.","Turning to 2015 goals. I wanted to summarize what's been said on this call and highlight a few additional goals for 2015. Starting with deliveries. We are currently geared up to deliver between 23,500 and 24,000 homes for 2015. We expect a backlog conversion ratio of approximately 70% for the first quarter, 85% to 90% for the second and third quarters and 90% to 100% for the fourth quarter.","Turing to gross margin. Consistent with the goal that we set at the beginning of 2014, our gross margin percentage for 2014 netted to approximately 25%, excluding insurance recoveries and other nonrecurring items. We expect our gross margins in 2015 to average 24% for the full year. Although of these remaining healthy margins, the reduction is a result of less pricing power anticipated in 2015, bringing on some mothballed communities with modestly lower gross margins and a slight increase in the number of entry-level communities. There will be seasonality between the quarters, with the first quarter being the lowest gross margin percentage and then improvement in the gross margin percentage as volumes increase throughout the year.","Our SGA and corporate G&A lines, we continue to focus on leveraging these lines and expect 15 to 25 basis points of potential improvement in 2015. Financial services earnings are expected to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million for the year. The quarterly amounts are expected to be spread similar to last year, with the first quarter anticipated to be the lowest quarter of profitability.","For Rialto, we expect a range of profits between $30 million and $40 million for the year and it's heavily weighted to the second half of the year. As a reminder, 2014 included a partial collection and recognition of carried interest from Real Estate Fund I and additionally we had significant gains and increase in mark-to-market for assets held by our real estate fund which are not expected to be as significant 2015 at this point.","Multifamily is transitioning in 2015 into a profit center for the full year. We are expecting five buildings to be sold, all in the second half of the year, with the 2015 profit expected to be between $15 million and $18 million. In 2015, we expect to have building sales coming from this segment in each quarter.","Joint venture and land sales, the El Toro joint venture which Stuart highlighted, will result in profit to Lennar of approximately $30 million in the first quarter and additionally $10 million in the second quarter. We are not expecting other significant transactions and therefore the third and fourth quarters for all of our JVs are expected to be about flat. We are expecting approximately $25 million of wholly owned land sale profit in 2015 with the majority forecasted for the second half of the year.","Our 2015 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 34.5% to 35% and our net community count is expected to increase approximately 8% to 675 active communities by the end of 2015. With these goals in mind, we are well positioned to deliver strong topline and bottomline growth throughout the year.","And with that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Stephen East with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen East","Thank you. Good morning, guys. The question I have been getting from --","Stuart Miller","Viv, I think we lost him.","Operator","Yes. The line has disconnected. I apologize. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Good Morning. Thanks very much, guys. Yes, I guess, a lot of things to talk about but I did want to talk a little bit about the gross margin guidance for the year. You talked about the fact that there will be some improvements sequentially, which is pretty normal, but I am guessing probably also that the year-on-year comparison would probably, the decline would probably intensify in the back half of the year. I was wondering if you could confirm that that's probably the right way to looking at it. And also if you could talk about the -- you mentioned bringing back some mothballed communities. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that? Sort of where? Why now? And what kind of margin differential do these projects usually have? Thanks.","Rick Beckwitt","Hi, Steve, it's Rick. I will answer this. On the gross margin comparison year-over-year, we sort of hinted to about 4% decline year-over-year going from 25% to about 24%. Typical with the year, you will see some normal sequential improvements throughout the year, starting low, ending up higher. And probably the peak to trough won't be as dramatic.","With regard to the mothballed communities, this has been something that we have been doing all, you know, over the last couple of years, evaluating when they are right to bring back on and this is just a continuation of our asset monetization program. They are really spread across the country. Not anything really dominated in one particular area. We would look at 2015 probably in an order of magnitude about 10% of our deliveries will come from things that were taken out of that mothballed bucket and the margin differential is 200 basis points, 300 basis points, plus or minus, between what the average margin is for the company and those communities.","Jon Jaffe","Hi, Steve, it's Jon. So just to clarify that the 10% out of mothballed communities is communities opened in 2014 and what will open in 2015. So that represent that whole universe. And relative to timing of the margin in your question, as you know, our first quarter is always our lightest quarter for deliveries. So we have field expense impacting the margins there. So it's really not back-end loaded in terms of decline. I think you will see pretty consistent throughout the year, the differential that Bruce spoke about.","Stephen Kim","Okay, that's great. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of incentive behavior from your competitors in the marketplace and maybe I assume that that may vary from region-to-region? I know people are going to be particularly interested in what you are seeing in terms of posturing in Houston as well as in California. So maybe you could just talk generally about qualitatively what you are seeing in terms of incentive behavior in the field and also with a little bit a geographic flavor? Thanks.","Stuart Miller","Okay. So let me take that, Steve and just say that pretty much across the board, we are seeing intensified competition as builders do go out and chase volume. It's been somewhat of a complex market where a lot of factors are impacting sales across the board.","You mentioned, of course, Houston, where there are more questions than answers right now from the field. Houston, of course, is at least in part, as an economy dependent on the oil complex and the oil complex is going through a reconciliation. We haven't seen a significant change in that market condition. We are seeing a little bit at the higher end of a pullback but we have anticipated in our internal projections that there will be further reconciliation in that marketplace. It's in part one of the reasons for some of the pullback in our anticipated margins. Houston is an important market to us.","California, we have seen less impact so far. We continue to see pretty strong buying patterns in California. I know that there are questions about the currency changes and what that will mean for some of the foreign buyers there, but we haven't seen much of a pullback there. I know that there been other reports.","So you know, across the landscape there a lot of factors that are moving markets and changing the landscape and it certainly has intensified the competitive landscape for all builders.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much.","Stuart Miller","You bet.","Operator","We do have Mr. East back on the line. One moment. Stephen East, your line is open.","Stephen East","Thank you. And I don't know, I got cut off. So I just heard Steve's question. But if I could just follow-up a little bit, you know, the gross margins. If you could sort of rank order, going from 25% to 24% this year, as the things that you talked about, the mothball, the entry-level, et cetera. If you have already answer that, I apologize. And I was also wanting to understand how important is this mix shift become for you as you go through 2015 and then to 2016 as far as focusing on the entry level?","Rick Beckwitt","Hi, Steve, it's Rick. We have articulated for quite a while now that as that entry-level market comes back, we are going to be an increasing participant in that market and we plan accordingly. Most of that activity is really geared towards Texas and parts of Florida for the most part, although our other markets are participants in that activity. With regard to the margin on that, the margin for us on our entry level product is lower margin, but that doesn't mean that from a pretax and operating basis, that the margins are significantly different. It's just a different business model. With regard to the legacy assets, the mothballed assets, about 10% of our deliveries for 2015 will come from those communities. They carry lower margins, but on blend, we are pretty positive about our 24% margin for the year. It's a good, healthy margin and it could produce good bottomline profits for the company.","Stephen East","Okay, thanks and then just a follow-up question on the West. Big order gains. I guess could you give us some clarity on what was really driving that? And I heard some of the commentary about the Asian buyer, et cetera, but a significant difference in the West on your performance versus earlier and just maybe any color you can give and how you think about the sustainability of that?","Jon Jaffe","Yes, Steve, it's Jon Jaffe. We saw a healthy sales pace in the fourth quarter, above the company average. Inland Empire, which you know, there are some questions about -- we saw a pace of about four sales per community per month. I think we have some very well located communities due to our land position that we acquired earlier. We have got some very strongly performing master-planned communities. In the Bay Area, we are very well-positioned. We saw good activity through the Central Valley. So we really didn't see much movement in incentives to drive that sales pace a little bit, but I think because of the product and the locations of our communities, performance is remaining strong.","Stuart Miller","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. The first question I just had, if possible, I think there was a reference to some of the expected cadence of the gross margin throughout 2015, maybe starting a little bit lower and then increasing throughout the year as typically occurs but maybe not to a wide variance of range. Coming off of the 4Q results, I was just wondering if it is possible to give a little bit better granularity in terms of, you know you are coming off of a 25.6% and I guess, excluding the gain from Chinese drywall it's closer to 25.3%, would you be looking at something around the 24% range that you are looking for the full year? Or would it be, I guess, a little bit below that? And then I just have a follow-up.","Bruce Gross","For the guidance, Mike, this is Bruce, was around 24% as the average for the whole year. The first quarter tends to be lower because we have less volume and we have more field costs, which runs through gross margins. So that brings the number down. So it affects the first quarter to be below the 24% average for the year and then for the rest of the year the number should be closer to the average and maybe a little bit higher at the end of the year.","Michael Rehaut","Okay and I guess just the second question. You had mentioned that you had incorporated some caution or change in the Houston market into your full-year guidance. I was wondering if you could be a little more granular there as well? Do you expect some -- maybe how much of margin contraction do you expect in Houston? And maybe you can give us a sense of Houston in terms of the revenue impact and if it's operating right now at above or below average corporate margins?","Bruce Gross","Mike, I think it's always been our objective to call them like we see them, to be straight and to give the best estimate of what we are seeing out ahead of ourselves. And so as it relates to Houston, it's not an exact science. The market has not yet quite revealed itself. But there are other crosscurrents that are defining lot of questions that exists in the marketplace. And of course, we have injected appropriate conservatism in our thinking. So to get down and to get too granular, I think that we are making educated guesses in each of our markets about where the market is potentially trending. We can think across a broad landscape. We think about the California markets and some of the foreign purchasing that has come in those markets as potentially something that has to be considered and factored into our equation.","Likewise in South Florida, we have a pretty robust foreign investment group and those markets all have more questions than answers right now and the estimates are somewhat imperfect. What we have done with each of our divisions as we have gone through and had done at a very local level, think about the impacts of not just the day-to-day traffic coming in, but the potential impacts of macroeconomic factors that, as I noted in my opening, are choppy and sometimes confusing in evaluating the market.","So I am not sure that we can get particularly granular. It really is a market-by-market and community-by-community assessment that is kind of rolled up. But what we have tried to do is inject appropriate conservatism in thinking about 2015 and the competitive pressures that exists in the marketplace as we put together our planning for the year ahead.","Michael Rehaut","And just, if I could squeeze in one last one on the incentives and then I will get back in queue. It seems like it is broad-based. I just was curious in terms of the increase in incentives. If that was broad-based or more concentrated in certain markets and maybe how much of the monthly 100 bips of margin decline, gross margin declined for the company is incentives, being a cause of that 100 bips?","Bruce Gross","Incentives is always an interesting question. It really is just a part of purchase price. And as we have noted, it's part of a community-by-community evaluation, very micro level. Incentives in some markets are running a lot higher. In other markets, they are very low. Even within markets, there are some communities that have much higher incentives associated with them or purchase price alterations associated with them. We are very focused on looking at a community level, figuring out where the sales pace has slowed to a point where we are no longer properly leveraging overheads, think about where we add incentives to bring that sales pace up so that we maximize profitability out of the community.","So is it concentrated in an area? No. It's a broad-based assessment that you really can't put your finger on and delineate for the market. But it rolls up to what you are seeing here.","Michael Rehaut","Great. Thank you.","Bruce Gross","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Eli Hackel","Thanks. Good morning. Stuart, you seem excited or at least positively inclined about some of the mortgage market changes that have been announced. I was just wondering your level of confidence that these changes will actually impact the market. Some of the previously announced changes really don't seem to have done much. So just curios to hear your thoughts around that.","Stuart Miller","Well, some of them have been articulated and not quite implemented. I wouldn't overemphasize my enthusiasm for the specific changes. I think it's the beginning of a process. And I think that the fact that we are hearing this articulation at this point is suggestive of the fact that people are starting to understand that perhaps we have overcorrected and perhaps it's detrimental to the overall economy and to the landscape of the population and that we have got to start getting and reverting to normal. I think the reversion to normal will unlock a lot of pent-up demand. It's going to take some time and it's why I say on the horizon, I see the best times for the homebuilding operation.","But do I see a correction that takes place that alters the landscape in the next quarter, I think no. It's more part of the process. But I am fairly optimistic that politically, as a country, we are going to get to understand that capital is going to define or access to capital is going to define what builds the middle class and some of that revolves around housing and I think that people are going to be recommitted to building a for-sale housing market. That's going to work very well for us and other builders.","Eli Hackel","Thanks and then I was just wondering, you talked a little bit about it, but maybe go into a little bit more detail about the ongoing cost of the soft pivot capital allocation. Do you expect to be cash flow positive this year? And if so, sort of what are you thinking about doing with that cash?","Stuart Miller","We have been talking about this for about the last year-and-a-half and it's been very much part of management's focus. We have been gently pivoting away from a land-heavy strategy towards a land-lighter strategy and it is with the focus of becoming cash flow positive. We do think as we get the end of this year, we do start to turn to cash flow positive with a healthier turn, even more in 2016. We are very focused on our return on invested capital. We think that the first move with our additional cash flow will be in the form of debt reduction and focusing on our balance sheet, but ultimately we will be considering where access cash flow comes from. Remember that it's not just the homebuilding business that should be cash flow generative, ultimately our ancillary businesses also start to contribute and we think we are going to have some important decisions to make as we get into future years.","Eli Hackel","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman. Your line is open.","Alan Ratner","Hi, good morning. First, just a housekeeping question. The Hunters Point delivery, is that going to flow through the JV or consolidated blend?","Stuart Miller","The Hunters Point deliveries will flow through the joint venture line.","Alan Ratner","Okay. So when you gave the guidance for breakeven, I think, in the back-half of the year, on JVs, I thought you mentioned, first of the deliveries coming through there. So that's kind of incorporated in that guidance?","Stuart Miller","It is and we are doing very well with sales at Hunters Point. But just remember, we had a lot of front-end development costs that are also running through that line in addition to the closings of the first deliveries at Hunters Point, so will see more contribution as we get into 2016.","Alan Ratner","Got it. Thanks and just on the slow pivot ROIC focus. How should we think about longer-term how Lennar looks under that type of model because investors clearly have gotten used to you guys certainly outperforming on the gross margin line and probably the volume growth line as well as you benefited from that long land pipeline you had? So should we ultimately expect margins to revert more to that lower 20% range, which I think is indicative of a asset light shorter land model or should we stop short of going all the way there because you are going to settle out somewhere in between? And I guess, just kind of the cadence to get there, are we talking about this multiyear process or is this something that by 2016, 2017, you are pretty much where you ultimately envision the company being?","Stuart Miller","Look, I think that we still have an advantage in land in that would have land positions that carry-forward. That's enabled us to kind of fish in a different pond and use our land expertise to continue to build price advantaged land positions that's held us in good stead. We think, as historically, we will continue to outperform relative to gross margin there. Gross margins were down to moderate at some point and it shouldn't catch anyone off-guard that they will and should be some moderation in gross margin as we become more of a retail purchaser of land. But I think a normalized operating program of buying land and becoming more of a manufacturing model as markets mature as there is less distressed opportunity out there is exactly what Lennar is focused on, making sure that we are carefully balancing buying good land positions in the right locations, operating an excellent manufacturing model on the homebuilding side and really focusing on our balance sheet in the generation of cash and return on invested capital.","Jon Jaffe","I might add one thing on this. Part of the pivot is managing the length of the deal and how long we are in individual communities. And as we have bought various communities over the past, in the downturn some of these communities were very sizable that had multi-multi-year runs in order for us to build through them. So as we are managing the cycle and this pivot, it's a changing focus on the length of how long we want to be in some of these communities, given the fact that the market might change and we want to have a shorter-term of exposure.","Stuart Miller","Next question.","Operator","We have a question from Megan McGath with MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Megan McGath","Good morning. Thanks. This is a little bit of a follow-up to that last question and the last commentary there, I think is partially an answer. But I guess looking at Texas now, but this could be really any market where you are starting to perhaps see signs of slowdown or you see some writing on the wall. Can you talk a little bit about levers at your disposal? And maybe lessons learned versus the last downturn? Are there things that you would likely do quicker? Let's say, you start to see things slowdown, perhaps try to pickup pace quicker? Or related to last comment, is your inventory different than it was, let's say, nine or ten years ago that would just perhaps limit the over building that we could potentially see in some of these markets as you see sort of a fast slowdown in employment?","Stuart Miller","Look, as I noted in my opening comments, I think that the downside, even in a market like Houston, the downside is kind of defined by a change in the employment structure of the market where you start to see the oil complex really shed some jobs and that affects confidence and home sales, but I think that there are some countercurrent kind of considerations. While the oil complex moves down, gas prices come down and Houston is a more diversified platform than it has been in prior oil downturns. So we are not looking, we are not expecting a very sizable downturn, but I think that the way that we have configured our company and we have focused on purchasing assets, the locations that we have focused on as we have gone through, even in a downturn scenario, are the locations that hold up the best, that continue to perform the best in the market and we think that any downturn ends up being fairly shallow and we move forward.","So from a lessons learned perspective, we have clearly not gone out to the B-, C locations. We have not gotten out over our skis, We have already been tapering back on the land supply, the tail of land supply. And I think that we are really well-positioned to be able to just kind of, in an orderly fashion, work through inventories even in a fairly aggressive downturn scenario and be positioned with strong cash.","Rick Beckwitt","And I guess, just one comment on the Texas market since it's been brought up a number of time. The overall economy in Texas is very strong. You know, if you look at as, just going back to Stuart's opening remarks, job growth across the state has been incredibly strong, inventories are in the neighborhood of maybe one to two months of finished home supply. On the new side, resale inventory is extremely well as well and you have just outside of Houston, just very strong economies, with excellent job growth. Houston, in particular, as Stuart said, we haven't really been too much of change in Houston yet. But we were smart enough to know that if oil prices continue to be depressed, that there will be some negative reaction in the market. It generally happens that it is price point focused and one of the things that we have been focused on is making sure that we are a participant in all of the price points in Houston market in order to insulate ourselves to as much as possible with the changes in the market demands. And we are well-positioned that we are smart enough to know that as oil moves down, there maybe some job loss, primarily more on higher end and it could impact pricing and that's why we have given guidance to a little bit lower margin in Houston.","Megan McGath","Great. That's helpful. And then just to follow-up around the commentary on some of the government initiatives, clearly too early to have seen anything on the FHA but it's been a month or so since the announcements around the FHFA, 3% down mortgages and any kind of early indications that that's taking hold?","Stuart Miller","Not really. And I think that you have got to look at the landscape as relative to many of the articulations as multidimensional. One lever is probably not going to move the needle. I think that we have to properly regard the fact that the regulatory landscape has really discouraged mortgage lending. There is more than just underwriting criteria and downpayments at stake here. We have got to get people back in the game of making mortgages to people that really need the money as opposed to making mortgages to the people who are so far qualified that we never have to, but the only mortgage that we are to make is to Warren Buffett, we are certainly not going to have any defaults, but we are not going to make a lot of mortgages. We would better be able to bring the risk profile back to a normalized setting.","And it is in large part, the regulatory environment that is defining some of that. I think that the discourse, the commentary that's been coming out of HUD and FHFA is positive and constructive. People recognizing that perhaps we have put too strong of a lid on this mortgage business and if you listen to the commentary coming out of the banks, there still isn't a lot of appetite for land. So we haven't seen a lot of movement yet in the fields from these articulation, but they are promising in terms of important people starting to understand how the landscape has to migrate in order to really bring the buyer back to the market.","Megan McGath","Great. That's helpful. Thanks.","Stuart Miller","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Dahl","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess the comments on and the discussion around ROIC, it sounds like the implication would be that land spend would be down again in 2015? And if that is the case, then community count growth probably moderates further in 2016. Is that a fair way to think about how you are viewing the landscape today?","Stuart Miller","Well, land spend will move around a little bit as we go through the next couple of years. It's a little bit hard to peg down. What I am articulating is a focus of the management team to shorten the tail on some of the lands that we are purchasing and really looking at the risk profile as we go forward. That doesn't necessarily need a curtailment of community count expansion. It might be a moderation of the rate of growth that you see in community count. I think we have articulated about an 8% growth year-over-year as we look ahead. But I think you kind of look at that kind of pace as we go forward as well.","But it's more of the tail, the duration of land that we are purchasing rather than the number of communities. So we expect to continue to grow at a healthy pace as we go forward. And over time, where did I think of things for this management team is when we focus we succeed. The articulation internally for our group is , hey, let's bring the tail down, let's bring the risk profile down, let's continue to grow our business, but let's not get out over our skis as the market matures, as land pricing matures and let's continue to grow the business as the market permits.","Michael Dahl","Great and then as a follow-up, I guess you know, you have clearly articulated a number of different things happening across specific markets. As you think about those relative to your investments, where you looking to grow the most as you look out to the deals that you are instructing your field reps to go after this year?","Stuart Miller","Okay. So, a piece of your question cut out on us, but I think your question is where are we looking to grow the most? And the answer to that question is, almost a quarter-by-quarter evaluation on a market-by-market basis. And it's what we probably do the best. It's all about allocating capital to where that capital is performing the best, based on the reading that we are getting from the field from the traffic that's coming in. The market that is healing and that is moving forward well is going to get more capital allocated to it. The market where we see patterns of pullbacks, patterns of change in the markets in the negative, we are going to be investing less capital.","So right now we are kind of, if you think about the things that we have already talked about, we are kind of in a wait-and-see mode relative to Houston. We want to see a little bit more evidence of well, how the market is going to present itself and so we are probably investing less capital there. We have excellent positioned to build on in the meantime.","There are other markets like the Bay Area that we continue to have a strong view about and we are probably investing more capital there. But it is a regular assessment that we put in place through our top management team communicating with the divisions based on the patterns that we are seeing in the field.","Michael Dahl","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question from Michael Roxland with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Peter Gallo","Hi, guys. It's actually Peter Gallo on for Mike. Good morning or afternoon at this point. Just a couple of housekeeping questions for Rialto on the advance accrued interest. Is that a one time thing for this quarter? Or is that something we should think about as a recurring cash flow going forward? What's the best way to look at that?","Bruce Gross","So, for this quarter, it represented the last two-and-a-half years worth of taxable income calculation. So it will be recurring but at a significantly lower amount as you look at next year. It's going to continue through next year as well.","Peter Gallo","Okay and then just second, I know in your comments, Stuart, I think you called out some statistics on Next Gen in terms of order growth. Do you have anything similar, any sort of commentary around your Everything's Included?","Stuart Miller","Everything's Included has continued to be a Lennar marketing avenue that is a differentiator. Well, we haven't gotten an Everything's Included question in a long time. But we still think that sets us apart from the market in a positive and constructive way. I always think that plagiarism is the best form of flattery and when we see other builders jumping on that kind of program, which is what we have started to see. We know that it's something that attracts a lot of attention and sets us apart in a very positive way.","Our Everything's Included program is something that we focus on a lot. We think that we can be a lot more efficient and effective in harvesting cost reductions as we deliver greater quality and a broader product offering. There certainly is segment of the market that wants to customize. We are not the builder for that segment of the market, but we do offer an extraordinary value with our Everything's Included program and that value is what has driven our sales as well it has.","Even with that said, our Everything's Included program as we have grown it over time, does enable some personalization, so we broaden our offering to a solid range of the market and certainly enables us to capture more than our share of the business.","Peter Gallo","Great. Thanks.","Stuart Miller","Okay and let's make the next the last question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Jade Rahmani with KBW. Your line is open.","Jade Rahmani","Hi. Thanks for taking the question.","Stuart Miller","Sure.","Jade Rahmani","Just wanted to ask on Rialto. If you could comment on your view of the risk retention rules and whether you see this is a benefit to Rialto, given the five-year holding period and the 5% risk retention requirement?","Stuart Miller","So happy that we have on there. Jeff can really chime in. Go ahead, Jeff.","Jeff Krasnoff","Yes. Actually, from our perspective, we look at it as a big positive. In terms of the competitive setup there, it's going to be difficult for a lot of folks to do that, given some of the hedge funds that have come in, because of the five-year retention. So we think that that's, number one, is very good. And then number two is the 5% rule. We have a multi-disciplinary sort of fund raising capability with our investors that look for returns that go form one end of the spectrum to the other.","So I think that we are going to see pretty uniquely qualified to be a buyer there. And we also expect that before the rules go into effect, which is now a little bit less than two years that there will be a rush to securitize that we think we can increase supply. So I think we are, as far as all three of those points, we are well-positioned for it.","I think that the risk retention rules really speak directly to our core competencies. It kind of ushers things directly into the arena that we have historically operated and operated best. So the answer is yes, we think that it's a best for Rialto.","Jade Rahmani","Thanks and then just secondly regarding the cash flow that you expect to get back from Rialto? How do you see redeploying that capital? Would it be redeployed into Rialto? Or into Lennar's other businesses?","Stuart Miller","Look, Rialto has really taken on a mature positioned within the company. Rialto is the ultimate asset light model today. We have not been investing primary capital in deals in any significant way through Rialto. We have invested and will continue to invest in the funds that we create and participate as a limited partner in those fund even as we act as the general partner as well. But those private capital funds are the primary source of investment for Rialto and really mark the future for the company. So the Rialto strategy has more in the direction that we wanted it to over the past years and Rialto is positioned to carry forward with very limited need for capital. So we expect that that capital will be returned to the parent company and will be part of the cash flow that we have talked about earlier.","Jade Rahmani","Thanks for taking the questions.","Stuart Miller","You bet. So thank you everyone for joining us. We look forward to moving forward and reporting on our progress through 2015. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Operator","I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.","Stuart Miller","Great. Good morning and thank you. Thank you, David. This morning, I'm here with Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, Chief Operating Officer; Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dianne Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; David Collins, who you just heard from; Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto and others as well.","As always, I\u2019m going to start with a brief overview. Bruce will deliver further detail. And then we\u2019ll go to our Q&A portion where we ask your indulgence that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible in the hour that we\u2019ve allotted.","So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are very pleased to announce very healthy earnings for our third quarter, in spite of the active hurricane season that\u2019s affected our business at the end of the third quarter and carried into the fourth. And in fact let me begin today with an acknowledgment of the many across our platform who have been affected by adversity.","First, in our Texas markets, Hurricane Harvey affected all of our markets and especially of course Houston. And I want to thank the Lennar associates who responded and continued to respond so selflessly to care and assist with their time, with their wallets and with company funds to make a difference in the aftermath. Right now, it seems like this storm took place almost years ago but it was really only just last month and the continuing efforts are very much appreciated.","Next, Hurricane Irma came barreling through Florida through Georgia and up the eastern seaboard and affected millions of people in those areas. Again, Lennar associates responded and are still responding with their hearts, their care, their wallets, as is the company and this is greatly appreciated.","Additionally with Hurricane Maria, our hearts go out to the people of Puerto Rico and our company through the Lennar foundation is meaningfully contributing there as well. And then of course just yesterday, we all woke up to the tragedy that has gripped Las Vegas, another significant Lennar market. The ripple effect of the Las Vegas shootings affects us all but most impacts those closest to it.","And again, Lennar associates are activated and have already organized a blood drive internally and are contributing money to support grief counseling for those in need. Difficult circumstances call on great companies to properly balance excellent business practices with the human element and I am particularly proud to say that I believe that we have done exactly that at Lennar and I\u2019m very proud to be able to represent our efforts.","Against that backdrop, let me say that through the end of the third quarter and into the fourth, we\u2019ve been able to execute on our business plan and strategy of growing and refining our business while focusing on our balance sheet after paying all cash for our WCI acquisition at the beginning of the year.","Overall, we\u2019ve continued to see strength in the housing market through the third quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be in line with or above our expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs are being created across the country and wages are generally moving higher.","The often discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into wage growth. And while much of the data collected by the government doesn\u2019t seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our Welcome Home Centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment and an ability to afford today\u2019s more expensive homes.","Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the same sense that we have as business operators that the economic environment is generally strong and stable and improving. There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that the government\u2019s pro business stance will result at least in job security and possibly some tax release as well.","The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery is at least continuing to churn slowly while at sometimes even seems to be giving way to a more definitive accelerated recovery and reversion to normal. We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years have been and continue to drive some pricing power as we moved through the selling season and that is somewhat offset by land and construction cost increases.","Additionally, the economic realities of a constraint supply of housing options and the economic realities of higher rental rates are beginning to have and have had a rational impact on decision making for first-time homebuyers as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market. Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market. And as we look ahead to the final quarter of 2017 and into '18, we are expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve.","Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. To begin, our for-sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017 in spite of the storm activity described before. Deliveries for the third quarter increased 12% and our gross margin and net margins improved 20 basis points and 40 basis points year-over-year.","In the third quarter, new order increases of 8% in volume and 12% in revenues was driven by year-over-year community count growth of 9%, while our new order pace remained constant at 3.4 homes per community per month. Our strongest markets were Southeast Florida, the Bay area, Inland Empire and Portland, all with sales pace of over five homes per community per month followed by Orlando, Tampa, California Coastal, Fresno and Seattle, all with over four homes per community per month.","We continue to see success with our digital marketing focus, driving better quality traffic to our communities. In our third quarter, our social media outreach generated over 115,000 leads, a 15% year-over-year increase. This allows us to operate at a very efficient level where our total advertising spend is now down to only 40 basis points of our revenue.","Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We continued to see the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during the third quarter as we reduced our completed unsold inventory by 9% year-over-year and 21% sequentially without sacrificing margins.","Additionally and directly related, we have also seen our incentives per home delivered decrease to 5.5% across the platform which is our lowest sales incentives since 2006. As you\u2019ve heard from us in prior quarters, we are using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model. Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency driving our SG&A to historic lows of 9.2% for the third quarter which is the lowest in history. As I\u2019ve said before, we are simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time.","As I\u2019m sure you will recall we closed on the WCI transaction in the first quarter of this year. The integration of this acquisition has been executed seamlessly by Lennar\u2019s operating teams in the field and by our corporate support groups as well. With any combination, the hard work begins at closing. After all the fanfare, the real congratulations are due as results are achieved.","The WCI combination and integration is now complete and the results are coming in exactly as expected, as Lennar\u2019s margins, SG&A and bottom line are performing as promised. We simply have an excellent management team with tremendous bandwidth to execute and I\u2019d like to take a brief pause to express my appreciation for that hard work and focus as well and for the opportunity to represent their work and accomplishment to our investor community.","In addition, as I noted earlier, we came to the end of the third quarter Hurricane Harvey came through in Texas and that was followed by Irma at the beginning of the fourth quarter. For homebuilders and homebuilding divisions on the business side, these storms present many cumbersome challenges, whether the storm is a direct hit or a near miss. Preparation for these storms requires a shutdown of the business operations with extensive preparation to batten down the hatches, so to speak.","Associates need to care for their work environments and for their personal residence and families at the same time. After the storm, caring for our associates who might have been affected while surveying damage, attending to our customers and restarting business operations is equally difficult.","As we noted in our recent press release, we have come through these two hurricanes quite well. We have attended to our associates. We have accessed the damage to our communities. We have attended to our customers and have restarted business operations.","As we have said, our communities sustained only minor damage and due to the business disruption, we expect approximately 950 closings will be pushed from 2017 into 2018. Additionally, given the volume push into 2018, the positive trajectory of our margins will be temporarily impacted as well and Bruce will give some additional detail.","With that said, the Lennar team has done an excellent job of managing through difficult times as these hurricanes affected geographies representing some 50% of our volume by closings. Considering both the all-cash acquisition of WCI and the affect of the two hurricanes, we are pleased to report that we have continued to focus on cash flow and on our balance sheet.","We have maintained our 7% to 10% growth target and have focused on driving our operating costs down in order to drive bottom line and cash flow. These strategies have brought our balance sheet back to the position of the year ago with our debt to total cap at 39.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year. While the impact of the hurricanes will delay some of this progress over the next quarter, our strategy continues to be to drive strong cash flow and position our company for opportunity in the future.","Now let me briefly turn to our Financial Services segment. As you\u2019ve seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the third quarter as it contributed operating earnings of over $49 million. While profits and projections are down slightly from last year, the decrease is primarily due to storm impacts and the slowdown in the refi business.","Our core Financial Services business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and is innovating with new products like our recently announced creative student loan program. As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services continues to focus on product innovations as well as its non-Lennar retail business to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes.","LMC, Lennar\u2019s Multifamily Communities, our apartment segment has also continued to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $9.1 million of earnings in the third quarter driven by the sale of two of our merchant build apartment communities. While we have continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we\u2019ve also significantly grown LMV, our build-to-core program, which is cash flow focused on building an apartment portfolio.","In the third quarter, we started 836 apartment homes in three communities with the total development cost of $371 million. As of August 31st, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 75 communities, totaling approximately 23,700 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.3 billion. These include 36 merchant build communities totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.2 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion. Our multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations.","Turning to Rialto, Rialto contributed $3.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus $5.9 million a year ago, as our direct investments continued to be a drag on overall performance. These direct investments should be winding down over the next two quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses. This will enable us to efficiently lever our existing infrastructure and overhead and focus on our investment management business and RMF business segment.","The investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base. As we have said before, our first two flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers, which has helped Rialto attract both existing and new investors to newer vehicles. Our third opportunity fund, which is approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments, has already invested or has under contract 43 transactions involving the investment of over $850 million of that equity.","On the Rialto Mortgage Finance, RMF, side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 41st through 43rd securitization transactions during the quarter with net margins averaging 5.1% selling over $236 million of RMF originated loans.","Finally, just to mention FivePoint because I always have, as you all know, it\u2019s now an independent public company. Accordingly, the FivePoint management team will speak regularly for its asset base including the very positive news recently on progress at Newhall Ranch. As I\u2019ve said before from Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol FPH will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet as the value embedded in these extraordinary California assets is unlocked.","In conclusion, across our platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our third quarter and we\u2019re feeling very optimistic about our future. Given production deficits that persist, existing housing supply constraints, a pro-growth stance in government, generally solid employment fundamentals, we believe that the macro environment reads very positively for the next years and there is still a long runway in this recovery.","We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market for the future. In spite of the short-term speed bumps that will temporarily slow progress in the fourth quarter, each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform and strengthen. People, assets and operations are all aligned as we begin to prepare for 2018.","With that, let me turn over to Bruce.","Bruce Gross","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the third quarter were 249.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share. This compared to third quarter 2016 net earnings of 235.8 million or $1.01 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.03 per diluted share impact due to a lower 31.1% tax rate as a result of energy credits available in the prior year.","Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the third quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 4% increase in average selling price to 375,000. As Stuart highlighted, our homebuilding team has focused on the dynamic pricing tool to price and deliver more efficiently and it is reflected in our results.","Our delivery machine achieved a backlog conversion ratio of 74.5% while our completed unsold inventory dropped by 233 homes or 21% sequentially to the lowest level per community since 2012. Our pricing efficiency is also noted as our sales incentives dropped 40 basis points year-over-year to 5.5% which is an 11-year in a row and drove our gross margin outperformance.","Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.8% versus 22.6% in the prior year. Gross margin percentage were once again its highest in our Homebuilding East segment. The gross margin percentage was benefitted by 30 basis points this quarter due to insurance recoveries. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $56 per square foot driven by an approximate 5% increase in labor and 3% in material costs.","Our SG&A percentage continues to drive lower as Q3 was 9.2% compared to 9.3% in the prior year. Included in our SG&A in the third quarter were transaction-related expenses related to the WCI acquisition which had a 20 basis point impact but were offset by insurance recoveries. Our operating margin improved by 40 basis points for the quarter to 13.6%.","Other income net was 2.8 million compared to 30 million in the prior period. In the prior period, other income net included the sale of a clubhouse and management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures. ","Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was 9.7 million which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur G&A while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 108 new communities during the quarter and closed 86 to end the quarter with 758 net active communities.","New home orders increased 8% and new order dollar value increased 14% for the quarter. And as we disclosed a few weeks ago, there were approximately 120 new home orders that were impacted due to Hurricane Harvey. Our sales pace was 3.4 sales per community per month which was the same as the prior year.","During the quarter, we purchased 12,700 home sites totaling 498 million. We continue with our soft pivot strategy, however, this quarter also included the strategic purchase of 5,800 home sites in Maryland. Our home sites owned and controlled now total 176,000 home sites, of which 141,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled.","Our Financial Services business segment had operating earnings of 49.1 million compared to 53.2 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income decreased to 32.5 million from 38.3 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were 2.4 billion compared to 2.6 billion last year.","Refinanced volume was down 62% compared to the prior year leading to a more competitive origination environment. Refinances now make up only 7% of our total originations. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% for the quarter compared to 82% in the prior year.","Our title companies profit increased slightly to 15.6 million during the quarter from 15 million in the prior year, and that was driven by a 6% increase in revenue and operating leverage from the higher revenues. Our Florida realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated 1.3 million in profit during the quarter.","Stuart provided the multifamily detail, so now I\u2019ll turn to Rialto. The Rialto segment produced operating earnings of 3.2 million compared to 5.9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interest. The investment management business contributed 37 million of earnings which [Audio Gap] earnings from real estate funds and 32.3 million of management fees and other which includes 11.4 million of carried interest distributions.","At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate funds one and two now totals 108 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed 236 million of commercial loans into three securitizations resulting in earnings of 12.5 million compared with 491 million and 27.2 million in the prior year, respectively, and that\u2019s before their G&A expenses.","The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower volume. Our direct investments had a loss of 9.4 million as we continue to make good progress on monetizing the remaining assets from the FDIC and early portfolio purchases.","Rialto G&A and other expenses were 30.6 million for the quarter and interest expense including the warehouse lines was 6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with 155 million of cash.","Our tax rate for the third quarter was 33.4%. The rate is higher than the prior year's third quarter of 31.1% due to the additional energy credits recognized in the prior year. These credits expired on December 31, 2016 and were only available to us for part of this year. Therefore, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the fourth quarter.","Our balance sheet remains strong with the net debt to total capital of 39.6%, a decline of 30 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with 565 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our 1.6 billion revolving credit facility.","During the quarter, we redeemed early the 250 million of 6.875% senior notes that were acquired with the WCI transaction. We continue to significantly reduce our cost to capital as we improve our leverage ratio. S&P upgraded our corporate credit rating during the quarter to BB+. Stockholder\u2019s equity increased to 7.6 billion and now our book value per share grew to $32.11 per share.","Now I\u2019d like to update our goals for closing out 2017, starting with deliveries. We were right on track to achieve a 90% backlog conversion ratio for the fourth quarter before the storms hit. Using the same backlog conversion ratio and adjusting for the 950 homes that we talked about being pushed into 2018, now calculates to between 8,200 and 8,300 deliveries which is what we are now projecting for the fourth quarter.","Based on the projected closings in our backlog, we are increasing our average sales price guidance to between 380,000 and 385,000 for the year. We expect our fourth quarter gross margin percentage to be between 22% and 22.25%. This should bring our full year gross margin percentage to 22%.","The fourth quarter gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points as a result of 950 deliveries being pushed into 2018 and therefore a higher field expense per remaining delivery.","Additionally, these deliveries were primarily in Florida which has the highest gross margin percentages in the company. We continue to see improvement in the SG&A line and we should see another record low SG&A percentage in the fourth quarter as we are projecting between 8.5% and 8.6%.","Turning to Financial Services, as a result of the significant decline in refinances, lack of resale inventory and the storm impact, our fourth quarter is now projected to be in a range of $35 million to $40 million.","Rialto is now expected to generate profits for the fourth quarter of 2 million to 5 million which will bring it to about 25 million for the year. Multifamily is expected to be approximately 35 million to 37 million which will bring it to approximately 70 million for the full year.","The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, in this category we\u2019ve been highlighting all year that the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits. The fourth quarter is expected to generate approximately 90 million to 95 million which will bring the full year at the lower end of the previously range that we gave of 70 million to 80 million of profit.","Corporate G&A is expected to be 2.1% of total company revenues for the fourth quarter and our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities. We expect our balance sheet to again end the year with strong liquidity positioning us well as we enter 2018.","Let me now turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin our question-and-answer session for today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, please.","Robert Wetenhall","Good morning and congratulations on delivering some very strong results in a very challenging quarter and thanks for all the terrific detail. Stuart, I was hoping you could spend a minute and talk about ASP growth and the dynamic pricing initiative. It seems like you have a lot of pricing momentum, incentives are all-time lows and that\u2019s a real big tailwind. At the other side you\u2019re going to have some labor constraints and issues with the hurricane rebuild activity. I wanted to understand how Lennar is going to balance those going into the fourth quarter and 2018?","Stuart Miller","Well, let me start and I\u2019m sure that Jon who\u2019s really been spearheading the dynamic pricing and Rick would also want to join in. But dynamic pricing \u2013 our dynamic pricing model helps us in a number of ways and really it helps us focus in order to drive margin and even ASP growth. It starts with a proper alignment of our production machine and our sales machine recognizing that as we near completion, it\u2019s time to sell. That has really enabled us to bring down our incentives generally. And as I noted, our incentive levels have come down to the lowest level since 2006 at 5.5%. And I feel that that\u2019s very directly tied to the initiatives in and around our dynamic pricing. Now another part of that is the driving of our inventory levels. We\u2019ve seen a number of our divisions benefit in both generating pricing power and driving down incentives by being able to reduce standing inventory. Standing inventory homes are generally the ones that come with the greatest discounts or the greatest incentives. And getting people tuned in to properly aligning pricing and delivery and clearing inventory earlier has helped that. So, Jon, do you want to add to that?","Jon Jaffe","Sure. The efficient delivery of the homes that Stuart is describing is really enabled by providing our division the data so that they can pull the right levers at the right time to match sales pace with construction pace and as Stuart mentioned the low inventory levels. Last quarter we were down to 1.25 homes per community on average of completed homes that were unsold. I don\u2019t have the data as to whether that\u2019s a record low but I don\u2019t personally remember ever being that low. And by orderly selling the homes through the construction process, having a buyer who\u2019s mortgage approved, ready to close as the home is completed really enables us to reduce the incentives both helping ASP and margins. I\u2019d also want to note that we\u2019ve talked for several years about the impact of our next gen platform and there our sales are up 41% year-over-year and now represents just about 6% of our company\u2019s total sales. That\u2019s also a high mark for next gen sales. And the ASP of next gen is almost 490,000 compared to the company averaging 375,000. So it\u2019s a number of initiatives that I think cumulatively are giving us the results that we speak to.","Rick Beckwitt","So that\u2019s all the good stuff. They left me with the cost side of the equation. And on the cost side of the equation we\u2019re doing our best to hold our trades accountable for the type of cost pricing that we\u2019re looking for. Clearly in this environment where you have people chasing the storm aftermath, there\u2019s some trades and some areas of the business that are tight and where people are going after the easy insurance money. Those are typically in the roofing, the drywall, the siding and depending on the market. That said, we constantly are adjusting sales pace with sales price and the real tricky thing for us at this point is whether we want to really push the trade and pay them more than what the job should really justify in order to accelerate the home or do we take a little bit longer to deliver that home. All of this will work itself out in the next three to six months.","Jon Jaffe","Bottom line, pace and price are really connected and we\u2019re using technologies to refine our processes and it\u2019s impacting in a number of efficiencies; on the cost side, on the incentive side, on the ASP side dropping down the gross margin and a few basis points at a time, we\u2019re making some real progress.","Robert Wetenhall","Yes, those are big strides. My follow-up question was Stuart or maybe the team, could you please give us an operational update where you are in Houston and how you are in Florida and whether WCI\u2019s integration is still on track? And maybe Bruce if you could just flush out a little bit more some of your comments about the pace and cadence of gross margin given the mix shift between communities and the deferral of deliveries into next year? Thanks and good luck. Congratulations on very strong execution.","Rick Beckwitt","Well, you really stack a bunch of questions into one. With regard to Houston and to Florida, let me just address that right now starting with Houston. The Houston market is slowly recovering. All of our communities are open and doing business today. From a trade standpoint, it\u2019s consistent with what I said. Trades are tight in the roofing area, the drywall area as you\u2019d expect because there was a lot of damage associated with the interior of the homes. Folks are \u2013 those trades are really chasing that insurance business and it\u2019s slowly getting better. From a power standpoint, we\u2019re really not having any power connection issues in the Texas markets. So that\u2019s a good thing. On the sales side of the market, we\u2019re having good traffic, good solid traffic where people want to buy. The issue is a lot of those folks need to sell a home that\u2019s damaged and they haven\u2019t received the insurance proceeds yet. And as a result it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time for them to get those homes repaired in order for them to buy something and people want to move into areas and communities that haven\u2019t been impacted by this type of weather damage.","Stuart Miller","Not just buy something. Some of them are under contract and were moving towards a closing and the storm now means they\u2019ve got to fix something or get their home ready so that they can sell it and ultimately close on their home. And of course we\u2019re cutting them some slack in this area.","Rick Beckwitt","Right. Of course we are. So that really covers Houston. Florida is sort of a mixture between north and south. In southern Florida, we still do not have the ability to get power connections. And as a result of that, that\u2019s slowing down the business. That will catch its way up. We have not had the ability to press the power companies because quite frankly they need to address other concerns before they do the new home market. We are doing some things that I think are unique. We\u2019re running some conduit between curb and the home in order to accelerate the connection. So when the power companies come out there to do the connects, we should bring things on pretty fast.","Stuart Miller","Let me just interrupt there and say what might be a little counterintuitive to the investor group is the power companies; it would seem that after the power is back on, everything normalizes. But the power companies actually have a pretty comprehensive intercompany agreement to go to where the problems are. So even a problem like the power in Puerto Rico brings some of the manpower from the power companies locally to other areas and impairs their ability to get back up running here in south Florida. So you\u2019re going to continue to see some disruption until many of these storm affected areas are really up running and stabilized.","Jon Jaffe","But one more point of clarity on that. As they fix power to existing areas, much of that is done on a temporary basis to get power up immediately. And so the next course of action for the power company is to come back and permanently fix that. So if there\u2019s a temporary pole put in, they have to come back and put a permanent. All of that takes priority over new home processes.","Rick Beckwitt","Then as you move up to central Florida, we\u2019re seeing that recovering faster. Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville are way ahead of where southeast and southwest Florida are. And then you asked about the pace and cadence in gross margin I believe going into next year, which we have [indiscernible].","Stuart Miller","Yes, which we haven\u2019t commented on that yet but we will with our year-end conference call we\u2019ll give detailed 2018 guidance. Next?","Robert Wetenhall","Thank you very much.","Stuart Miller","See you later. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Go ahead, please.","Ivy Zelman","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations and a special appreciation to all the Lennar family of getting through for the challenging times. Stuart, I have a question that I get every day from investors and the question is focused around Lennar\u2019s stock performance relative to Horton and Healthy Homes [ph] and they don\u2019t understand why the stock is lagging. I think the best thing that we could talk about I guess to understand it is our focus on returns by both companies and talking about asset light and shifting more to an NVR model. But we obviously saw a decline in your ROE which was related to WCI and obviously you expect that to resume acceleration. But can you talk a little bit about targets around ROE and maybe talk to your expectations and whether or not you\u2019ll do things to improve that level of ROE beyond call it 15% boggy that would actually help stock perform at a better level?","Stuart Miller","Look, first of all, Ivy, in the immediate past I think that we\u2019ve had an unusually large overhang on our stock as it relates to pending storm activity. And I think that\u2019s been the case now for some time. I can\u2019t even tell you how long. But aside from that if you look at our strategy and you look at the way that our company is performing, we\u2019ve been very focused on a growth strategy that targets 7% to 10% rate. But with WCI that\u2019s been trending a little bit higher. We are very focused on cash flow and using cash flow to both pay down debt and ultimately look at stock buyback. But stock buyback comes in a number of different forms. Remember that we had initially targeted WCI to be a 50-50 stock in cash transaction. It ended up being an all cash transaction which was in effect a large stock buyback. It\u2019s fully integrated. It\u2019s well executed. And we\u2019re becoming a real cash flow program and machine which affords us the ability to target transactions to use cash in a variety of ways. And we\u2019re fully confident that as we move forward, our strategies are going to reflect on our returns on equity and on capital perhaps more importantly in very positive and constructive ways. We\u2019ve mapped out our strategy for the Street to consider. The execution has been flowing in course. And I think that over time remembering that we are less focused on quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month stock performance and more concerned and focused on adherence to a strategy that is designed to maximize return on equity, return on capital over a longer period of time, we\u2019re fully confident that our stock performance will continue to be excellent over the long term.","Ivy Zelman","That\u2019s helpful. I think what I want to \u2013 and I agree. I think you\u2019re the best right now stock in at least Zelman\u2019s top pick. And what I think is important is people appreciate that you are focused on back to being a pure homebuilder which you said on previous conference calls. And maybe talking about some of the ancillary businesses, obviously the FivePoint expense was a success. So just thinking if you can give us any perspectives on your strategic initiatives getting back to being a pure homebuilder?","Stuart Miller","Yes, so both \u2013 as you mentioned, FivePoint we\u2019re there. With regard to multifamily and Rialto we still have I believe a couple of years of maturity and execution to really prepare them for a spin. And I for one simply don\u2019t want to sell cheap. I\u2019m about maximizing shareholder value over longer periods of time. And I think both of these engines, both of these machines have the ability to be best-in-class executions and will afford our shareholders strong values as they mature. LMC is progressing exactly \u2013 not exactly, even better than we ever anticipated. If you look at the composition of our apartment communities, the distribution between the merchant build and the build-to-core programs that we have in place, we just have an excellent program of execution ahead over the next couple of years that will define an extraordinary value for that compendium of assets. As it relates to Rialto, we\u2019ve had some bumps in the road which we\u2019ve articulated over time. We still need another couple of quarters to clear those bumps and to start striving forward and we have every confidence that we\u2019ll be able to do that also. But if you look at Rialto as a private equity asset manager and investment manager, if you look at Rialto\u2019s RMF execution, those two isolated go-forward programs are best-in-class. They are blue chip and they will ultimately drive shareholder value. So I think we\u2019re right on course and I think that we have the management patience to execute well over a longer time horizon. The stock market might fluctuate a little bit more on a short-term basis and we\u2019re going to continue to execute our plan. I think the most important thing to focus on is the bandwidth that we have in this company to migrate turbulent waters, to execute our business strategy and to execute across a rather broad platform and I think we\u2019re right on course.","Ivy Zelman","Can I sneak one more in quickly just on the cash flow? Do you envision more M&A and are you looking for opportunities to complement your existing footprint? And thanks for taking my questions guys.","Stuart Miller","We never comment on M&A but we leave all options open. And we think that the cash flow program that we have in place really enables us a broad range of opportunities to be able to access \u2013 to be able to execute and to be able to perform and I think that you\u2019ll continue to see us balance between all kinds of possibilities and execute on opportunities. So we\u2019ll leave it at that. And next question?","Ivy Zelman","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim of Evercore. Go ahead, please.","Stuart Miller","Good morning.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys and good job in the quarter. In particular, it\u2019s helpful that you have taken a stab at trying to quantify the impact of the hurricanes and that\u2019s really where I wanted to spend my first question. And there are a couple of things here so bear with me. You mentioned 50 basis point impact. It wasn\u2019t clear to me whether that was a fourth quarter comment or an annual comment. And then you also mentioned that you were seeing some of your customers in Houston needing to repair their homes. And that sort of brings to mind this question of what the fade of the margin impact you think ultimately may be? And I know you\u2019re not going to get specific until later, but I\u2019m interested in sort of what things you are likely to put into that bucket on hurricane affected margin? For instance, when you have people who may have lost more equity than they anticipated in their home because it was flooded in Houston and then he dropped out if there\u2019s any cancellations that\u2019s been out of that, would that be something that would show up? If you have to pay extra for labor, are you going to try to quantify the amount you\u2019re paying extra for labor or is it simply going to be we think maybe we lost some sales total and what impact we think that has on our overhead at the project level? If you can just help us think about how you\u2019re thinking about quantifying the hurricane-related affects on your margin?","Stuart Miller","Bruce is going to jump in and talk a little bit more about the margin effect, but before he gets to that let me just jump in on this notion of fade. I think it\u2019s going to take some time to actually ferret some of this out. But overall long term, given the loss of residences in a generally constrained market to begin with, you\u2019re more likely to see a supply shortage that as homes get repaired, there\u2019s really very little fade in terms of value and pricing. As homes get repaired, the value comes back and I think that you\u2019re going to see a shorter term negative turn into a longer term positive and that\u2019s traditionally what we\u2019ve seen in storm affected areas through many decades of having dealt with it. It takes a little bit of time for things to get back on their feet. And as we talked about the loss of or the postponement push of some closings from fourth quarter into 2018 and some directly related to homes to sell that have to repaired and ultimately brought on line, those homes will get repaired. They will be sold probably at the price that was expected with very little re-trade and I don\u2019t think that that will be the impact to margin, if anything. It will probably come around and lift the ability to raise prices maybe with some offset from cost on the labor and material front. But, Bruce, go ahead.","Bruce Gross","In your first question, the 50 basis points that I highlighted, that\u2019s purely the impact related to the fourth quarter by pushing out 950 deliveries and the impact with less volume that field expense is going to be higher per remaining unit. So that\u2019s just the impact for Q4.","Stephen Kim","Okay, got it. And so I guess by implication and that means that you\u2019re probably going to be at the lower end of your margin expected range for the year, excluding the hurricanes, I guess would be the implication from that. I guess \u2013 the question that I had \u2013 my second question really relates to the technology and the role of technology on your results in your gross margin and SG&A. Obviously, it\u2019s been really impressive. It\u2019s been \u2013 and I know that you\u2019ve been out in front and have been very active and continue to be active in ways that your competitors are not. And I guess my question relates to what you think \u2013 what inning do you think we are in, in terms of not necessarily digital marketing and dynamic pricing per se, but the ability of the technology initiatives that you see on the table right now being able to benefit the margin structure of your business over the next few years, like what inning do you think we are in? And what do you think the first-mover advantages are in these technology-related investments? Like how much can you keep do you think relative to your competition?","Stuart Miller","So if you\u2019ve ever been to a baseball game, you\u2019re begging a baseball metaphor here. Have you ever noticed that people warm up before the game actually starts? That\u2019s the inning that I think we\u2019re in.","Rick Beckwitt","In a minor league game.","Stuart Miller","I think this is just getting started and there\u2019s a big, big range of opportunity in the technology field to refine the homebuilding business that has only started \u2013 we\u2019ve only started to prick the surface of some of these areas and we are really invigorated by it both myself, Jon, Rick and our whole management team are really focused on this. And I would encourage you at some point to \u2013 when you\u2019re down here, Steve, to come visit and make sure that you see our innovation center which we\u2019ve done on our third floor here. We are fully focused on thinking about how technologies can create efficiencies through our system in every part of our business and we think that there\u2019s a long way to go. Your question of course is how much room is there to enhance SG&A or to bring SG&A down? And I can\u2019t quantify that right now. But I think we\u2019ve just started to figure out how to really build that better mousetrap that I keep talking about. Now your next question is to what extent is there a first-mover advantage? I\u2019m not going to say a first-mover advantage because I believe that others can learn and jump on board. But it\u2019s not about first-mover advantage. It\u2019s about incorporating these technologies is hard, hard work. It\u2019s hard work to learn and understand how they work and then to transport that knowledge out to multiple divisions in multiple geographies is a very complex management engagement and it\u2019s something that we work on every day. So as you\u2019ve watched the improvement of migrating from conventional to digital marketing, that seems like a kind of binary, oh, let\u2019s just make a movement but it has come with a learning curve, a testing curve, a proven curve and then an implementation curve that is really difficult to overcome. So it\u2019s not a first-mover advantage in a traditional sense. It\u2019s the sooner you start, the more time you\u2019ve put behind you in doing the hard work and the heavy lifting that it takes to actually implement these programs. So our work is not to run to get ahead of others, it\u2019s to move hard, work hard every single day to implement and to garner that 1, 2 or 10 basis points per week, per month, per quarter of improvement that we\u2019ve been articulating as we\u2019ve gone through the past years.","Jon Jaffe","I do think though that as each initiative goes through that process that Stuart described of testing and ultimately into implementation which is as rigorous as he described, it gets easier and easier as time goes on, as people understand the benefits of these technologies, the change in management aspect of that is easier to address and to incorporate the 2.0 version and 3.0 version. So I think that whether it\u2019s first mover or not, it\u2019s sooner you get started the sooner you\u2019re going to get to better and better execution of new technologies.","Stuart Miller","But I don\u2019t think somebody can come along and just pick up and copy what we\u2019ve done and say, okay, now we\u2019ve got the answer so we can get the answers right on the test. The implementation is the hard part.","Stephen Kim","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful and very thorough. I appreciate it. And if anybody\u2019s going to get it done, it will be you guys, so that\u2019s great. Thanks, guys.","Stuart Miller","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning or now I guess it\u2019s afternoon. Nice results and congrats on getting through all the challenges weather-related obviously. It was huge undertaking I\u2019m sure. First question, Stuart, I wanted to circle back to the comments you had in your press release actually and I believe you had this even on your initial prior release around estimations of impact. And you said in the release again today was that you expect an increased demand in homes in the storm-related areas which will result in a broader range of opportunities as we look towards 2018. So I just wanted to see if you could give a little more detail around that statement. From our perspective when you think about the impact of the storms and I think you\u2019ve alluded to this in previous questions, it seems like it\u2019s more around fixing existing homes, getting insurance recoveries, power related, et cetera. Certainly there might be some incremental demand for new homes in terms of maybe people wanting to move out of a damaged home. But just wanted to get a sense for \u2013 you said you\u2019ve been through this before. What specifically \u2013 is there any expectation in terms of maybe incremental new home demand going up 5%, 10%, 15% in the respective states or is it more of a broader statement? And when you say a broader range of opportunities, if there are certain specific types of initiatives or certain types of communities or pivoting or maybe for multifamily, what exactly do you mean by that?","Rick Beckwitt","It\u2019s Rick. Why don\u2019t I take a stab at it and then Stuart and Jon can chime in. There\u2019s several aspects of this that are just different pieces. One is just the overall new capital investment as you\u2019re rebuilding various markets. There\u2019s going to be tremendous capital invested in infrastructure that\u2019s going to create new jobs, that\u2019s going to create wage growth, that\u2019s going to allow people to just have more spend as they\u2019re looking at buying homes just in general. The second aspect of it is as you look at where the storms hit, particularly in Houston \u2013 let\u2019s just focus on Houston right now. There\u2019s going to be parts of the market where FEMA will shut down and will not allow homes to be built in those areas. As a result of that for folks like us to have a lot of land in other parts of the market, more the upland areas, that\u2019s going to create over time just long-term fundamental demand. The other aspect of it and I put this sort of in both markets, the Florida markets and the Houston markets, as you look at what happened with regard to the storms, the newer homes, the newer production, the newer construction faired so much better than the used home market, the existing market. As a result of that you\u2019re seeing a continued shift of people saying, I\u2019d rather live in something that\u2019s going to weather the storm than be impacted by the storm again and again. So those are just a few aspects of the opportunities that exist out there that creates that longer term fundamental demand in the aftermath of these storms.","Jon Jaffe","And that\u2019s the pattern we\u2019ve seen in prior storms on your question about experiences. It\u2019s sort of fundamentally a reallocation of capital from insurance companies to local economies that drive those local economies trading, as Rick said wage growth, job growth and demand for housing. That combined with a shortage from homes temporarily taken out of the market generally bode well for a mid-term housing market recovery.","Stuart Miller","The infusion of capital into these markets, even those that don\u2019t seem to have been affected that much is a sharpening arm to people who are thinking about buying, moving up, trading and it just stimulates the economy in the long run.","Michael Rehaut","That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate all the color there. Second question on the gross margin guidance. I guess you\u2019ve identified that of the 22 to 22.25, 50 bips of an impact from deliveries. And then you also mentioned a negative gross margin mix from the delayed Florida deliveries. A couple of questions here on this I guess just to understand. Was the negative gross margin mix in addition to that 50 bip impact from the delayed closings which sounded like a little bit more of negative fixed cost absorption? And if so or if it\u2019s not, it seems like the prior guidance was pointing to a 4Q gross margin in the high 23s. So just was curious what changed outside of the 50 bip hit, because also obviously your 3Q gross margin came in above expectations. So just curious if there was other shifts going around or what really fully impacted on top of the hurricane hit, the gross margin outlook?","Stuart Miller","I\u2019ll explain the 50 basis points again. The reason for the 50 basis points was both for the 950 deliveries being pushed which took into account the fact that they were higher margin Florida deliveries that were being pushed. So the remaining deliveries on an average basis would have a lower gross margin percentage as well as the impact to losing some leverage in field expense. So that\u2019s already embedded in the 50 basis points that I described.","Bruce Gross","The mix of that\u2019s about half and half between the margin mix and the additional cost that we don\u2019t have, the ability to leverage that over more closings.","Michael Rehaut","So what would then by the difference in terms of the prior guidance in the high 23s?","Stuart Miller","We did have a range for the year, Mike. So we still are ending up with the range that we had for the year, the lower end of that range of the guidance that we gave previously.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. And then just one clarification. The 300 to 385 ASP; that was not for the fourth quarter, that was for the full year?","Stuart Miller","No, that was for the fourth quarter.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. Thanks very much.","Stuart Miller","Let\u2019s take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Go ahead, please.","Paul Przybylski","This is Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. Going back to the gross margin question again, do you feel like that mid-22% range is normalized? And then should we expect a swing of the 50 basis points to show up in the first quarter of '18?","Bruce Gross","It\u2019s so tough to make a prediction on where normalized margins are right now in the context of where the trade basis out there are like at the moment. And I think we\u2019re going to have to see what happens with regard to them rebuilding themselves, where they\u2019re focused on, what activities are out there and how the power side of the equation comes back to the market. It\u2019s a little bit too soon to be commenting on that.","Stuart Miller","I think that we don\u2019t want to give kneejerk guidance. And the bottom line is in the middle of turmoil, it would be easy to try to give something and then not be able to live up to it. I think we\u2019re going to have to let these markets settle a little bit. ASP is going to be affected. Incentives are going to be affected. Construction costs on labor are going to be affected. And we\u2019re going to let the market settle a little bit before we give more guidance into 2018. But we feel pretty good about the business overall.","Paul Przybylski","Okay. Then what kind of impact you expect from the storms on development? Do you think that might delay some community openings that could maybe cause your top line to come in towards the lower end of expectations?","Stuart Miller","When you have a lot of water and wind come through a certain area, you got delays. There\u2019s no question about that. And what we\u2019re trying to do is manage our business as efficiently and effectively as we can. Jon and I tell the guys all the time, we don\u2019t want a weather report; we\u2019re looking for execution. So I\u2019m not here to give you a weather report at this point in time, but there\u2019s no question we will encounter some delays. That\u2019s going to be with regard to getting some materials. Pipe is pretty tight right now. In addition to that there\u2019s just been a slowdown on the overall inspections as both the municipalities are focused on other infrastructure things that are more compelling to get up and running.","Paul Przybylski","Thank you.","Stuart Miller","Okay. With that, thanks everyone for joining us and we look forward to updating you with our fourth quarter conference call. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart A. Miller","Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2013 update. We're pleased to share our results this morning. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto, are here with us here as well. Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, is available by phone for the Q&A session. We also have with us Eric Feder, who has been a bridge for deals within the company, and today is his birthday, so we asked him to join us for the conference call today. So happy birthday, Eric.","I'd like to begin this morning with some remarks on the overall state of the housing market recovery and then briefly overview our operation. Bruce is then going to provide some detail on our Financial Services segment as well as some additional color on our overall numbers. And as always, we'll open it up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","So to begin, let me make 4 macro points about the housing market recovery. First, housing is recovering, and the recovery is consistent, healthy and growing stronger. We saw from yesterday's housing starts and permits numbers that the recovery in housing is continuing to progress in both multifamily and single-family products. This data confirms what we've seen in the field for some time.","There has been an underproduction of housing during the downturn, as we produced as few as 550,000 homes per year during the downturn of both multi- and for-sale product. This is very close to the rate at which homes become obsolete. So for some of those years, we had essentially no net production against the normalized household formation rate of some 1.25 million annually. This shortfall will have to be made up, and the market is beginning to move in that direction.","Second point, national numbers continue to be tricky to interpret. On Monday, the U.S. homebuilder confidence number showed a decline, which suggested that the recovery might be stalling or might not be as robust as expected. Against that backdrop, yesterday's numbers confirmed continued recovery.","In our view, the conflict in the information rests in the fact that the homebuilder confidence survey is primarily a polling of smaller private builders. Their lowered confidence reflects their limited access to capital and, in turn, a limited access to land. The larger builders have had access to capital and land while the market was depressed. And since then, land prices have moved significantly. Late participants in the land market are having difficulty participating in the market recovery and are not able to solve to acceptable margins in their underwriting.","The lack of builder confidence against the backdrop of increased starts and permits supports our thesis that larger builders will increase market share while also participating in the broader market recovery. Land positions owned in the context of housing recovery is driving homebuilder confidence. I suspect that a builder confidence survey of the larger, well-capitalized builders would reveal substantially higher confidence.","Third point, the recovery is based on strong market fundamentals. Low interest rates and relatively low home prices continue to produce low monthly payment rates, which compare favorably with local rental rates. Not only is for-sale housing extremely affordable, but it is a preferred and more stable alternative to rentals, which reprice every 12 months. Inventories are low for both new and existing homes as demand increases, there are fewer homes to purchase and prices are being driven higher.","Distressed homes are being absorbed by the investor community and repurposed as rentals. While these homes are primarily in secondary and outer fringe locations, they would not compete with new product anyway, and they're being taken out of the for-sale pool as the market rebuilds. In the short term, these rental homes are helping to fill the void of the short supply of rentals for a growing demand. In the longer term, as these homes are put back on the market, they will likely be purchased by the renters that are in them as they find that they can qualify for homeownership. We do not view this as a looming inventory problem.","Finally, resurgent demand for homes is constrained by the mortgage market currently, which has constrained demand with an overly restrictive underwriting criteria. Slowly, however, the landscape is improving as banks are beginning to reconsider their credit underwriting overlays and open the doors to more approvals. While this process has been and continues to be slow to mature, we've come a long way since last year at this time, and we expect to see further definition of the regulatory environment leading to a further extension of credit to the market.","While there have been and still are economic and political uncertainties ahead, we feel that this housing recovery is fundamentally based and driven by a long-term demographic need for housing. We believe we are still in the beginning stages of a recovery that will be sustained for several more years.","Now turning to Lennar. Lennar has been and continues to be very well positioned for the current recovery in housing. This is reflected in our first quarter 2013 results and in our positioning for the future. In our first quarter, new orders were up 34% over last year, and our dollar value of backlog is up over 100% to the highest levels it's been in 5 years.","Gross margins improved year-over-year to an industry-leading 22.1%, a 120-point -- basis point increase over last year. And operating margins increased 410 basis points to 10.1%, reflecting the operating leverage in our absorption growth. For the full year 2012, we expect our average gross margin to be between 23% and 24%.","Margins continue to benefit from our proactive land acquisition strategy as well as higher home prices, lower incentives and operating leverage from greater absorption community of 3 per month, which is a 20% improvement over last year, and then, of course, from more sales overall. Our average selling price for the fourth quarter was $269,000, a 9% increase over last year, which covered the increases in labor and material costs, which increased approximately 4%. Our homebuilding operations have been improving due to a strong operating strategy complemented by excellent management execution.","Additionally, we opened 80 new communities and closed out 55 communities during the quarter to end at 484 active communities, a 14% year-over-year increase. We continue to expect our year-end community count to be approximately 550 communities as our land acquisition strategy drives our growth.","Today, we are fortunate to have the land in hand to meet our projected deliveries through 2014. As a result, we are primarily pursuing land opportunities for 2015 and beyond. This is an enviable position in today's market, a position that was earned through a very strategic land acquisition program that began in 2009. This program has put us several steps ahead of the competition and allows us to fish in a different pond.","We're using our balance sheet to tie up land opportunities that will produce strong margins for years to come. Many of those assets are large-scale multiyear flagship development deals. Rialto has continued to play a very big part in our land program, and I want to thank the team for their hard work and dedication.","Complementing our homebuilding operations, our Financial Services segment had another strong quarter with operating earnings of $16.1 million compared to $8.3 million last year. Our mortgage company captured some 79% of Lennar homebuyers within the markets in which it operates. Mortgage operations have also benefited from a robust financing market. Lennar home mortgages should continue to grow alongside our expanding Homebuilding business as well as serve non-Lennar purchasers in selected markets.","While our Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our 3 additional operating divisions are all maturing to be excellent longer-term value creation platforms for the company. Rialto continues to grow as a blue-chip private capital investment management company.","While current earnings have slowed as we have shifted from balance sheet investment to a fund investment model, the prospects for future consistent earnings continue to improve. We've now invested or committed almost $1 billion of equity in Fund 1. Performance for the fund is already well ahead of original projections, and subsequent to year end, we started distributing capital back to investors. In addition, if we continue on this performance path, we expect to well exceed the return hurdles set for our investors, which means carried interest with an oar to Rialto as the manager of the fund. None of that potential value is reflected in our current earnings picture.","Finally, in December, Fund #2 had its first closing of commitments of approximately $260 million, including $100 million from us, and we've already started investing that capital. Lennar multi-family, our apartment division, commenced construction on an additional 2 communities in the quarter and now has 4 communities under construction nationwide with a growing pipeline. And FivePoint Communities is quickly moving to bring developed land in premium locations to the market to fill the growing demand for well-located approved and developed homesites.","In conclusion, as I reflect on the current positioning of Lennar and the state of the current housing recovery, I could not be more optimistic about our future. The housing market is healing and recovery is accelerating as we produce shelter that is needed for a growing population and a return to normal levels of household formation. As the housing market continues its overall trajectory back to normal, it will provide stimulus to the overall economy through job creation and building long-term consumer wealth, which for generations has been a benefit of homeownership.","Our homebuilding machine is extremely well positioned and continues to gain market share. We have excellent land position in a constrained land market, and we have an excellent management team that will continue to be our primary driver of current earnings. Homebuilding is supported and enhanced by Financial Services, which will grow in step with the homebuilder and continue to develop its third-party operations to enhance its bottom line.","Rialto continues to expand its franchise and invest in high-yielding alternative assets while supporting the homebuilder with access to off-market homesites. Our growing multi-family platform provides an additional long-term and complementary growth opportunity for the company. And finally, FivePoint, with its large long-term California land assets, simply couldn't be better positioned to reap the benefits of an appreciating land-constrained housing market.","Although there will be political and economic headline risk, the drivers of our business are fundamentally sound. I am confident of Lennar's position in today's marketplace and rest assured that our future growth is supported by a strong balance sheet with an exceptional group of leaders who will be able to navigate through the challenges and towards the opportunities of 2013.","And with that, let me turn over to Bruce.","Bruce E. Gross","Thank you, Stuart, and good morning. I'll provide additional colors to the numbers, starting with the homebuilding segment. Revenues from home sales increased 40% in the first quarter, which was driven by a 28% increase in deliveries and a 9% increase year-over-year in average sales price to $269,000. The increase in deliveries resulted in a 79% backlog conversion ratio, which exceeded the 75% expectation given on our fourth quarter conference call.","The average sales price by region is as follows: The East region was $251,000, up 13%. The Southeast Florida region was $271,000, up 2%. The Central region was $258,000, up 17%. Houston was up 12% to $258,000. The West region was $294,000. This was down 7%, but that was due to product mix. And then the other region was $339,000, down 6%.","Our gross margin on home sales was 22.1%, and that compared with 20.9% in the prior year, an improvement of 120 basis points. The gross margins from our new communities purchased since 2008 continue to outperform the company average gross margin during the quarter, and they represented 57% of the company's deliveries in the first quarter. Sales incentives were $23,300 per home, and that was 8% as a percentage of home sales revenue. The sales incentives improved by 420 basis points or $10,900 for home delivered versus the prior year.","The gross margin percentage for the quarter was highest in the East and Southeast Florida regions. However, this quarter's results had an increased product mix coming from the Central and other regions, where the gross margin percentage is lower than the company average.","As we highlighted on our fourth quarter conference call, there is seasonality in our gross margins, and it tends to be lower in the first quarter and then typically increases throughout the year. This is due to lower closings in the first quarter, as well as higher field cost due to preparing to open more communities as well as winter-related costs in our communities.","Our SG&A percent increased -- improved by 290 basis points to 12% this quarter. This is the incremental operating leverage that we have been discussing for some time as our volume and particularly our absorption per community increases. Through the downturn, we transformed the entire company to be on our Everything's Included platform, and we eliminated our design studio divisions remaining from the U.S. home acquisition. This move allowed us to eliminate multiple divisions in the same markets. And as a result, the number of homebuilding divisions has been reduced from 124 divisions at the peak in 2006 to 29 today. This is resulting in significant operating leverage on our G&A line. Additionally, we have focused heavily on using social media to attract our homebuyers, which has significantly reduced our advertising costs.","With the improvement in both gross margin and SG&A, our operating margins, as Stuart mentioned, improved by 410 basis points to 10.1%. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 9,400 homesites, totaling $472 million, and we invested $120 million in land development. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 135,000 homesites.","Turning to Financial Services. Mortgage pretax income increased to $16.4 million from $8.9 million in the prior year. The first quarter improvement was again helped by the strong refinance environment leading to higher volumes and higher profit per transaction. This quarter's mortgage originations increased by 60% to $1.2 billion, and originations with non-Lennar homebuyers were 58% of total originations this quarter. Again, that was primarily driven by a robust refinance market. Our title company had a $300,000 profit in the quarter compared with a $100,000 loss in the prior year.","Turning to our Rialto business segment. They generated operating earnings of $1.7 million during the quarter compared to $9.4 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest.","The composition of Rialto's $1.7 million of operating earnings by type of investment is as follows: The first Rialto real estate fund contributed $6.4 million of earnings. The FDIC and wholly-owned bank portfolios contributed a net of $300,000 of earnings. And these amounts were reduced by approximately $5 million of G&A and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $6.3 million.","At quarter end, the FDIC debt, net of cash available in the defeasance account and in Rialto's cash account, was only $99 million. We expect this debt to be paid off this year, and then there will be significant cash flow generation back to the parent.","This quarter, we reversed approximately $25 million of the remaining deferred tax asset reserve, all of which pertains to state taxes. We expect reversing another $30 million to $40 million this year if our earnings trend continues.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity remained strong during the quarter, with $1.1 billion of cash on hand and no outstanding borrowings under our $525 million credit facility. We continued our balance sheet strategy of pushing out debt maturities while driving down cost of capital as we raised $275 million of 4.125% 6-year senior notes and $175 million of 4.750% 10-year senior notes during the first quarter. We received a ratings upgrade from S&P to BB- during the quarter, and our net debt to total capital improved by 30 basis points year-over-year to 49.3%.","To recap what was said on this call and highlight a few additional items for future quarters in 2013, I'm going to list a few areas, starting with active community count. Stuart mentioned that we are on track to be at 550 for the end of 2013. I wanted to remind people that there's a heavier concentration opening in the second half of the year. We expect our backlog conversion ratio to be between 85% and 90% for the second and third quarters and then should increase to between 90% and 100% in the fourth quarter. We expect to continue to see a positive gross margin trend during the year, increasing from last year's average of 22.7% for the whole year to between 23% and 24% as an average for 2013, with the typical seasonality throughout the year. We expect to see about 100 basis points year-over-year improvement in SG&A percentage in each of the next 3 quarters remaining in 2013.","Financial Services. We do expect that the number of refinanced transactions will slow as we progress through the year, and the profit per transaction, which is at very high levels right now, will moderate as we go through the remainder of the year.","As highlighted on the call, Rialto is in a transitional period as the PPIP investment was successfully completed last year and the second real estate fund will be ramping up throughout the year, so Rialto's profitability is expected to be backloaded in 2013.","Excluding the impact from additional deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversals, we expect to have an effective tax rate going forward of approximately 39%. We're very well positioned, as we start our second quarter, with the strong backlog dollar value that Stuart mentioned and the favorable industry dynamics as well.","So with that, let me turn it over to the operator, and we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Stephen East, ISI Group.","Paul Przybylski - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Actually, this is Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. I was wondering if you could go over your philosophy on order pace versus price and what you're focusing on now as we move through the year.","Richard Beckwitt","It's Rick Beckwitt. It's a delicate balance in the field. We are reviewing pricing weekly in every community across the country. We have been increasing prices probably every couple of weeks in some communities, at least once a month in all communities. And we balanced the pace-price split really on a local basis. Our preference is to increase price over pace, particularly in communities where we have a long position, a lot of homesites to close out ahead of us. And to the extent that we're on the back end of the community, we may move through that community without too much price increase because of the incremental overhead associated with the fewer deliveries.","Paul Przybylski - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you spent $500 million on land. What's your target for this year?","Bruce E. Gross","I think that you could probably count on about $500 million a quarter.","Operator","The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan Chase.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I appreciate your comments at the beginning, Stuart, where you mentioned, in terms of some macro comments, that you believe the housing recovery is actually growing stronger and that credit also is slowly improving. I was wondering if you could give -- certainly, your own trends are improving quarter-to-quarter, particularly in terms of price, and the comments that Rick gave are very helpful. Are there any areas of specificity or granularity, particularly as it relates to the market growing stronger? It kind of almost points to acceleration, and I think that kind of belies some of the optimism, particularly around pricing, that you shared with us when we met with the last month.","Stuart A. Miller","Well, I think, Mike, that -- I think that when we look backwards, what we have generally seen is that the trends that start to reveal themselves in the national numbers and come through performance reports are things that we start to see and feel in the field early. It's tough to be granular about these things. It's more about traffic, quality of traffic and the conversations at the field level that you're having with customers. I've noted that this recovery is starting to feel fundamentally driven and fundamentally sound, and it's primarily because the communications in the field are about people thinking about their monthly payment as it compares to rental rates, their monthly payment as it compares to stability and disposable income. And this is a real shift from people just kind of saying, \"Hey, I want to own a home.\" It's about nickels, dollars and dimes and making sure that they're managing their life as well as possible. We are seeing that demand is growing. It is somewhat constrained by the smaller funnel of mortgage approvals. And so we're seeing not as much demand come through the numbers as demand is out there. And the constraint of the mortgage approval process is really keeping the recovery more sedate than it feels like it wants to be. And again, this is somewhat of a feeling from the field. Now looking at the mortgage approval process, it feels like it's fairly static when we think about it in kind of real-time sense. But if we go back a year or we go back 2 years, the mortgage approval process has really liberalized itself quite a bit. It was just a couple of years ago that it was virtually impossible to make your way through the maze of the paperwork and verifications that were required to get a mortgage. And though those might not be hard credit statistics, those impediments were just as severe as a 780 FICO score. People didn't want to go through the morass of trying to get a mortgage. Today, it is a more streamlined process. The buyer is educated as to what their down payment, their FICO scores, their credit status have to be in order to get approved, and they're coming in more prepared. Mortgage money is becoming marginally more available, and I think that trend will continue as we start to get legislative and regulatory certainty injected into the banking system; the overlays will start to dissipate a little bit.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great, I appreciate that. I guess, the second question, on the Rialto business. I believe you said that -- in the release that there was a $7 million impairment. Just wanted to get a sense of what that share was for Lennar's consolidated in terms of your pro rata share, how that affected profitability. And the real estate fund, $6.4 million contribution as well, is that something that we can assume will kind of continue in that rate? Or is it going to be kind of lumpy or maybe grow modestly? How should we think about that?","Bruce E. Gross","Okay. Let me start, Mike, with your first question, the impairment of $7 million that was noted in the release. 40% of that is ours. That's our share in the FDIC transaction. And that's really based on, as we look at our cash flows, it's more of a timing issue. As we pushed out the timing of some of the resolution of the assets, that resulted in a little bit of an impairment. So in our numbers, it's 40% of that $7 million. On the real estate fund question, each quarter, we go through a fair value analysis. The real estate Fund #1 is doing exceedingly well. And as Stuart talked about there being a significant carried interest that will mirror back to Rialto, that's a significant amount of profitability that will come in at the tail end of the fund as opposed to on a regular basis. So there's significant value creation there, but that tends to be backloaded. The quarterly amounts for the real estate fund will be based on the fair value of the assets each quarter.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So quarter-to-quarter, it could differ? It's not as much of a stream?","Bruce E. Gross","Sorry. One more time, Mike?","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I said, so you're saying you've kind of a fair value analysis? So quarter-to-quarter, it might differ, as opposed to kind of like more of a consistent stream?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Mike, it's Jeff Krasnoff. There is a consistent stream from regular operating earnings as well. So the answer is it could vary quarter-by-quarter, but it is an ongoing stream.","Operator","The next question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","I guess I wanted to ask you, Stuart, given the success you've had in the quarter and, arguably, with the early signs of recovery, many clients asked me the question, \"What can derail the housing recovery?\" And the question is always posed, and as we see the Federal Reserve now with zero fund -- fed fund rates, QE3 likely to end potentially second half or first half of '14, how do we think about those risks and the potential negative impacts on the housing fundamentals and your just overall view on QE3 and the fed funds, et cetera?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, look, as I noted, Ivy, there are political and economic questions that could impact. And clearly, the government is contending with questions of how to deal with the debt issues. And a radical mistake, which I don't think we're prone to make as a country, a radical mistake could derail everything. So I don't want to minimize the possibility that something very severe comes our way in terms of political risk. It just seems unlikely to me. The strength of this recovery, as I see it and as we see it in the field, it really is driven by monthly payment and people desiring to find a stable way to identify their cost of living, monthly cost of living, in a static wage environment and maybe even a growing wage environment. Because of those fundamentals, I think that we are pretty secure in terms of moving forward and continuing to recover. Now in terms of QE3 and the elimination of QE and all those questions, we're really talking about interest rates. And I think that we're -- as we look at our business, we think that there's room for interest rates to go up without derailing the current trajectory. If you really do the math and look at the impact of interest rate, of an increase of 100 or 200 basis points in today's limited shelter alternatives environment, we're likely to see rental rates get pushed up if demand shifts back over to rentals. And therefore, the comparison, even at those higher interest rates, is going to be favorable, and people have to have a place to live. So I think there's pent-up demand. I think there's a shortfall in supply that derives from the downturn. I think that the cost, the monthly cost of living is where people are focused right now, and we're likely to see a continued recovery. That's my best guess.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC","No, that's very helpful. I guess my question will be more specific to the strategy, Rick, you alluded to that you prefer to take price over pace, but you have a balancing act to maximize. And what many of our clients are struggling with is trying to differentiate builders and the positioning they have, whether they were, like you, aggressive in the downturn, utilizing your capital structure and positioning yourself. Is it fair to say that even operators that are not as well positioned, as long as home prices are going up, that we should see, generally for the industry and probably Lennar, we'll outperform on margin improvement. Because many think we're hitting a wall because of labor constraints or raw material inflation, land inflation is getting too ahead of us. So just your general comments. I don't know, Rick, if you want to answer that.","Richard Beckwitt","Sure, Ivy. Clearly, if prices continue to increase, the industry will benefit from additional potential margin as long as the builders are careful and controlling the cost and the input cost into the homes. We're working it every day. We're not accepting all price increases that come through, although we are taking some on the chin. And we'll continue to work the inputs into the home. And we have to value engineer to keep costs down, that's what we'll do. I think some companies, and probably the publics, are better at dealing with these type of issues than the privates are. And we're optimistic that margins will continue to increase. We've given that guidance throughout the year, and we'll see where it goes, Ivy.","Stuart A. Miller","Let me just add to that and just say that, look, the increasing costs come from land, labor, materials. Our land component is really well identified over the next couple of years, and the land that we're purchasing is for 2015 and beyond, so we have a pretty good lockdown on the land cost relative to the homes that we'll be delivering over the next couple of years. And that's a big component of what is, in some instances, a cost increase component. From a labor and materials perspective, we think that home price appreciation is likely, as we go forward, to continue to outpace the increases in those 2 areas. We've seen that. I think that we noted in our opening comments that sales price had increased some 9%. Costs were somewhere around 4%. Whether that's a relationship, whether it tightened a little bit, we still see sales price outpacing cost increases as we go forward. One last thing I'll say is as it relates to land, we are buying and have been buying a lot of land, but a lot of that land is in our pipeline already: land deals that have been contracted for, that are in diligence or in some form of entitlement process, that are waiting to be closed. So these land deals, even as we close them from today going forward, many of them were negotiated at a different point in time and help us lock down that cost component.","Operator","The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","John Coyle - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's John filling in for Stephen today. Since you touched on cost, could you maybe run through the various cost components and what specific materials you're seeing the biggest increase in price? And for those that you are seeing pretty dramatic increases in price, is there any ability to hedge that away? Maybe if you could give some color on that.","Stuart A. Miller","Jon, why don't you take that?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Sure. The materials where we see the biggest increases, in order of that, is lumber being the largest, then drywall and then concrete. On the labor side, associated with that, framing labor has seen the biggest stress and, therefore, the biggest increase; drywall labor as well; and then plumbing and paint labor. Still seeing a lot of the metrics for pressure, upward pressure on those material costs as we look forward, and we expect we'll continue to see that. And the way that we manage -- we don't go out and buy hedges but we, through our national purchasing process, lock in extended contracts. And those vary in length depending on what the materials are. So for example, lumber, which has been volatile, we're typically locking in 3 or 4 months of pricing at a time. Other products and materials, we might be locking in a year at a time. Labor tends to go on a community-specific basis in terms of time period that, that's locked in.","John Coyle - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. That's really helpful. Then just wanted to get an update on the schedule for the big FivePoint Communities that you have out West. I believe the first one to really come on is going to be El Toro. But do you have any update as far as timing for those various communities?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","This is Jon again. At El Toro, we'll see our first transaction, where we'll be selling homesites to builders, closing sometime in our second -- sometime in this quarter, and for builders to be having a grand opening of their products sometime later this year. At Newhall, we continue to move through the Valencia assets that are on the east side of the freeway. And Newhall Ranch, which is on the west side, is still in its processing of its maps for that process, so that's still probably about 18 months or so in front of us. In San Francisco, Hunters Point, we'll see the first vertical product coming out of the ground by sometime in the late second quarter or early third quarter of this year.","Operator","The next question is coming from Dan Oppenheim, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Was wondering if you could talk about the trend in the West. Looking at the order growth, it was a little bit lower. So what we've seen is a lot of communities where they're temporarily sold out in terms of having lots for the future but sort of metering the pace of sales now. Can you talk about how much you're doing that in some of these communities and what we should think about in terms of order growth and pricing and such?","Stuart A. Miller","Jon, go ahead.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Sure. In the West, it will be a very community-specific review of that sales pace. So since there hasn't been much in the way of finished lots being produced by the industry over the last several years, there are many communities which we do meter the rate of sales and suppress it below what the market would demand. So in that case, we are seeing more significant price increases. In some markets where there are finished homesites in front of us, we're able to achieve a much higher sales pace. So for example, in Northern California, in the Sacramento area, where we have a healthy supply of homesites in front of us, or the Inland Empire, we were able to be achieving a higher absorption level because we're able to pick up our production levels.","Richard Beckwitt","And this is Rick. The other thing I'd add is, if you look back over the last several quarters, probably going back through the last 2 or 3, 4, the West has been a large percentage of our new land acquisition. So you'll continue to see some growth stemming from those recently acquired deals in the next year or so.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then next, the follow-up, you talked about the market broadening in terms of the recovery overall. We've heard some talk about how traffic isn't improving so much but so that it's very high quality in terms of conversion. Can you comment at all in terms of what you're seeing with the broadening? Are you seeing traffic increasing as well, or how is that, Rick?","Richard Beckwitt","This is Rick. Traffic has been very strong. Quality of traffic is even stronger. Year-to-date, our traffic is up significantly pretty much across the board, and conversion rates are strong. So we're encouraged with what we're seeing out there. It gets back to some of the fundamentals that Stuart mentioned in his opening comments with regard to limited supply, people being -- understanding the qualification process. It's a decent market today.","Operator","The next question is coming from Adam Rudiger, Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Stuart, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the 2015 land purchase -- lands you're buying for 2015 and beyond in terms of what the competition is for those kind of lots relative to newer delivery-type lots, what the assumptions you used for those are and kind of what the state of that land is that you're buying or looking at?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, listen, I'll let Rick take the bulk of that. But I think that a lot of the land parcels that we're looking at for 2015 or that we're purchasing for 2015 are really already identified and in our pipeline. We've been working on those deals. Either they're in negotiation and -- or under contract. The assumptions for many of our deals are without a pricing increase model, though, in some instances, we do find that we're injecting some inflation into our underwriting. So Rick, why don't you...","Richard Beckwitt","Yes, I think pretty much across the board, the stuff that we're looking for '15, and '16 for that matter, is things that are not yet developed. They're either raw or need some entitlement work. So we will work jointly with the landowner today, put some seed money into the deal or maybe carry the -- cover the entitlement cost with an opportunity and a lock on the purchase of the land once things happen. And as a result of that, land owners today don't have a lot of capital to invest in the underground -- the underlying property. So it's a win-win deal for us and for them. They move the property along, and we contract it at a wholesale price. So when things pass go and we get everything in line, the approvals, the entitlements, the -- everything the way we want it, the density, we'll close on the land 2 years from now. So it works well for us. With regard to the competition in that piece of the pie, what we found is that most of the other folks right now are looking for current delivery things. There are some that have a land-light model and don't want to invest in underground -- underlying property and develop. So the competition is much more limited.","Stuart A. Miller","I think that one of the advantages, if I could just add, that we're finding, there are 2 groups of potential competitors that are kind of hamstrung right now, the land developers -- the banks are just not lending on land. The old acquisition development loan for land deals is not getting back on track right now. So it really is the well-capitalized public company that has the ability to access the capital to invest in land assets and to drive the entitlement and development process forward. The other group that's really sidelined are the smaller builders. The smaller builders have also had that same access to capital issue where, coming out of the downturn, the banks have just not recast their confidence relative to that group that did not perform particularly well in the downturn, and so they're not competitors. So while the large capitalized -- large well-capitalized homebuilders are out there and competing for some of the same properties, our ability to really cast our sole attention to those later land deals enables us to negotiate well and to position ourselves well and focus just on that group of assets.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. The second question, Bruce, I wanted to ask about gross margins, I know you made a pretty intentional -- it sounded like some potential commentary on some other puts and takes, but I just wanted to ask the question again anyway. If I look at the gross margin this quarter relative to, say, the second quarter of last year when you actually had -- you did greater revenues, Homebuilding revenues this quarter, which would suggest volume maybe didn't -- wasn't a negative impact for you. I was just surprised. I would have thought the gross margins would have been up more, given how strong the reduction in incentives there. So can you just talk about that a little bit more and maybe what I'm missing?","Bruce E. Gross","Sure. There is really 2 items that I'd say are different there. Number one, we did have an increased product mix coming from our Central and other regions, where the gross margin percentage tends to be lower than the company's average. And then additionally, our field costs tend to be higher in the first quarter. And what we did is we looked at our states that have colder weather: Minnesota, New Jersey, Colorado, some of the mid-Atlantic and even Pacific Northwest. And there's a number of costs that are involved when you're looking at those winter states that happen in the first quarter. And we went back over the last decade or so, and it's a typical trend that your first quarter falls off as you go sequentially from Q4 to Q1. And even if you looked at similar revenues, you just tend to have more of those winter costs, which, Rick, you might want to highlight a couple of those.","Richard Beckwitt","Yes, it's not in all the markets but clearly, Minnesota, Chicago, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey, Boston and, to a lesser degree, the Carolinas, depending on the market. They're just incremental direct costs. Excavation is more important, more expensive depending how deep the frost line is, and you've got to over-excavate. You can't use the fill. You got to bring sand in because you can't compact the cold dirt. You got to mix the concrete hot with CO2 and with chloride and water -- hot water. You've got incremental field expenses associated with trenching for the utility lines. Cost of heating the homes is higher. There's just a lot of costs associated with building in the winter. For some markets like Minnesota, it could be $10,000 to $12,000 to $13,000 more per home during that time period of the year. So it happens every year. Depending on the amount of snow and how cold it is, it's worse or better.","Operator","The next question is coming from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wanted to follow up on Adam's question about the land purchases. You mentioned you're focusing on land purchases for 2015 and beyond. I wanted to understand, in terms of your land buying activity, how absolute a statement that is. In other words, does that imply that if you see a finished lot deal or your land guys, who are obviously going to be super busy right now, they see a finished lot deal come up, they don't even bother going through the brain damage of submitting a proposal for it just on the presumption that the pricing is not going to be attractive? Maybe if there's some numbers you could give us the kind of help us understand, like 70% of land or lots that you're buying is for 2015 and beyond, some of them may be for a nearer term. Just some color around that, please.","Richard Beckwitt","This is Rick. Clearly, if we find a finished home site deal that's available at good margins with a developer that we're working with today, good relationships, we're going to gobble that thing down. What Stuart and I have been saying is that, given the fact that we have in place today a pipeline of land to meet deliveries through 2014, it gives us the flexibility to focus more on the long, dated type of things that will come online in the later years. We've very focused on leveraging our overhead structure, investing cash, maximizing returns and driving profitability for our shareholders. So to that extent, if we see something that can be added for this year or next year, we're going to focus on that. It just gives us the flexibility to look a little bit longer in the land curve.","Stuart A. Miller","Yes. Just adding to that, we have always been driven by opportunity. And I think that, that is what is unique about our company is our ability to hunt, I think, is better than it's ever been. It's Eric's birthday. He's sitting here in the room. But Eric, I've mentioned before, has been a bridge between Rialto and Lennar, enabling us to find opportunities when we're looking for one thing that really services another part of our company, keeping that open mind to opportunities where and when they might exist that might be off the beaten path. To the extent that we see opportunities to get off-market deals that are not subject to the same competition, the same pricing pressures, where we can make a company-normalized margin, we're all over that. And those kinds of opportunities are still out there for us, and we're still looking for them, it's just not our primary everyday focus. Our primary everyday focus is recognizing that as we go forward, we're going to have a -- we're already stable for 2013 and '14 in terms of what we expect to deliver. And '15 and beyond is where our primary focus is right now.","Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And second question I wanted to ask about was spec homes under construction. I was just wondering if you can give us an update on those numbers. And in particular, what I wanted to understand was we're heading into the -- or I'm sorry, we're in the spring selling season, obviously, with a greater degree of confidence than we've had in years and years. And so how has that affected your rate of spec build and just generally what you're seeing out there from your other competitors as well?","Stuart A. Miller","Okay. In terms of the spec building, the number of homes under construction that are unsold are 3,667 this quarter, and that's about -- that's 52% of what's under construction during the quarter. And if you look at total starts for the quarter, we had 4,898, and that compares to 2,954 in the first quarter of last year.","Bruce E. Gross","And I guess the other stat we look at is number of completed homes that we have across the universe of our communities that are unsold, and it's less than 2. So we think that we have a very fresh inventory today. We're starting on a very fast clip. We want to get our inventory moving. And if you look at it today versus at the end of the year, we had about 1,600 or 1,700 more homes than where we ended up at the end of the year.","Operator","The next question is coming from Will Randow of Citigroup.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Stuart, Rick, I wanted to revisit the color you provided on land spend a few times. I was hoping to get a feel for the breakdown in 3 ways; specifically, what is the breakdown between develop spend -- or development spend, rather, spend on undeveloped dirt and spend on developed lots.","Richard Beckwitt","Will, I don't have the breakdown right now, but we could get it to you later on what was finished versus developed. So I'll have to get back on you -- back to you on that.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, could you provide color directionally on how you think -- how you go through that thought process for when you're acquiring today? Is it more on development dollars?","Richard Beckwitt","There are some markets where there's a pretty active development business. Those would be in some of the Texas markets where there's developers that are churning land today. So in those type of markets, we're buying finished homesites on a takedown. I would tell you that across the board, we have been acquiring properties that require some development activity. We've got development skill set in-house, and we're leveraging that expertise. My guess is if I had to pick a number out, it's probably 60%, 70% development-oriented deals, and the balance is either finished or semifinished, take them down on a plot and just doing on-site versus the off-site.","Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, Bruce, as a follow-up, I may have missed it, but did you mention where demand is tracking second quarter to date? And could you provide any color on what gross margin is for that demand?","Bruce E. Gross","No, to answer your question, Will, we did not give any additional color going into the second quarter on demand, and we didn't talk specifically about the gross margin trend going into the second quarter. But we did reiterate that we're still comfortable that our gross margins for the year will be 23% to 24% for the full year and that the sequential trend will continue where it's lower at the beginning of the year and tends to grow each quarter throughout the year.","Operator","The next question is coming from David Goldberg, UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's actually Sue for David. Bruce, in your comments, you mentioned that you guys have closed out of your design studios in Houston. And as this recovery is coming together, are you finding that your Everything's Included is sort of ramping up with that in that you're having to make fewer sort of one-off or specific changes to what's in the packages? And as part of that, given that this recovery is more concentrated among the move-up buyers, have you made any fundamental changes to it in order to be more attractive to the buyer that you're seeing out there today?","Richard Beckwitt","This is Rick. In Houston, we do operate under the brand Village Builders, which has a component of a design center, but we still are a very much EI-oriented builder. What we have done on the EI platform is incorporate, just to simplify, the good, better, best type of specification level for our homes. You can't choose the individual items out of the package. It comes with the package, so it's Everything's Included in that package. That's allowed us to move up through the different stages of what someone wants to spend on the homes.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","This is Jon. I'd also add that our EI platform makes it easier for us to ramp up our production because we know what we're going build, we don't have to wait for the customer's order, as well as, in markets where we're able to benefit from greater appreciation by wading into the construction cycle, since we know what's going to go into the home before we sell the home. So our EI platform is both very efficient, as well as it allows us to maximize the margin, having our cost locked in when we start the home, before we sell it.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then along those lines, as demand ramps up and as we get further into this cycle, are you seeing any changes in your cycle times? And now do you think those will compare as demand improves relative to past cycles?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","This is Jon again. We're clearly seeing a small increase in cycle time, as there is stress on the labor market as not only we but the whole industry is increasing the production flow that's out there. It's still below where it was at the peak of the last cycle, and we feel like we're much better able to control it with our more focused product strategy and fewer divisions. So we have more consistency of product. But clearly, as you would naturally expect, as the cycle picks up its volume, we are seeing a little bit of movement in cycle time.","Stuart A. Miller","Okay, let's take one last question.","Operator","And the last question is coming from Ken Zener, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could give us -- given your joint ventures are getting more active, clearly, in places like Valencia or El Toro [ph] as they're coming online, can you give us, one, a description of how much income you expect within a range from your JVs this year versus, let's say, last year? And then taking a step back, are you more inclined to be the seller of the land? Or should we think that the buyer of the land is actually getting a better deal, however you want to cut a balance? Because I would think the seller of the land would be in a better position than the builder. If you could just kind of give us a sense how you balance that in terms of the price you set to the other side, the buyers?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, first of all, we're generally not giving an overall guidance as to what the joint ventures will produce. Those earnings will come as they come, and they will tend to be a little bit lumpy from time to time. In terms of the pricing of the property, the land, right now, those ventures, the FivePoint deal, the deals that fall under the FivePoint umbrella, are really uniquely positioned in just some of the most desirable markets that are extremely land constrained. And any time, as an owner of land and a developer, you find yourself in that position, pricing really does come down to what the seller's selling for. So it really gives us some pricing power and opportunity to drive earnings as the market continues to improve, and we just think that FivePoint is very well positioned. I think Bruce talked earlier about some of the timing relative to some of our positions coming on -- or Jon did. But that's about as much guidance as we give.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Understood. It seems like as a seller of land, you're in the better position. Maybe Bruce or whoever, I think people, investors, have in their mind, given the deflationary environment we faced or are coming out of, that, in fact, specs are lower margin, which in the last 4, 5 years has been the case. But it seems to me, given pricing moving upwards more often than not, can you talk about specs and how you see the spec spread coming in? Because it's seems if you -- especially with an Everything's Included house, if you start building in January and fix the price, you can actually be, in fact, making more money on specs as you move through the cycle if, in fact, the home is worth more in May when you're setting the price as opposed to have locked it in, in January. So can you talk about the impact of spec margins impacting you and if my thesis is correct?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, this is Rick, and I'll start out. And if Jon's got something, he can add to it. We definitely have crossed the line where a spec is not something that's discounted. We are waiting to lock the price of that as late in the process as we can. Our inventory is working for us today as opposed to several years back where someone wanted a discount if there was something that was standing tall in a community that was unsold. So we're letting the appreciation in the market work towards our benefit. And what we are doing also is on presales, we're not discounting those as well. To the extent someone wants a premium homesite in a community, we're loading it with what that homesite premium should be. And for them to choose a homesite and a community and a particular home, we're loading that up at the front-end, given the fact that it probably takes us 2 to 3 months to build it. Jon, do you have...","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Yes, this is Jon. I would just add to that, that, as Rick said earlier, we manage this weekly in each of our communities, what the pace is and pricing. We're clearly able to drive more to our bottom line margin by having our construction cost locked in with a started home versus a presale situation and benefit from an appreciating market by selling later in the cycle. So we should see incrementally more margin, to specifically answer your question, on a spec home versus a presale.","Stuart A. Miller","All right. That concludes our conference call.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart Miller","Great, thank you. Good morning everybody. This morning I am here with Rick Beckwitt our Chief Executive Officer; Diane Bessette our Chief Financial Officer; and of course David Collins, our Controller; Jon Jaffe, our President is joining by phone. I'm going to start with a brief overview. Rick and Jon will give a brief operational overview, and Diane will deliver further detail on our first quarter results as well as some additional guidance for 2019.","As always when we get to Q&A, I'd like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible. So let me go ahead and begin and say that, well, the housing market continued to be choppy throughout our first quarter, we are pleased to report very solid results. Although, we had slightly lower than expected deliveries and revenues, we achieved somewhat better than expected sales and margin as we did see strengthening as the quarter progressed.","Generally speaking, it seems as though the market paused in the back half of '19, corrected in the first quarter and is now on solid footing, as we begin the 2019 spring selling season. Looking backward, the housing market continued to slow through the fourth quarter 2018 as higher home prices and rapid interest rate increases combined to create a mismatch between prices and buyer expectations. Through the first quarter, interest rates moderated and home price appreciation stalled and even pulled back.","We clearly saw traffic and sales accelerate through the first quarter as strong employment, wage growth, higher participation rate, consumer confidence and economic growth drove the consumer to return to a more affordable housing market. Given this progression, we continue to believe as we said last quarter that the market took a natural pause, it has now adjusted and recalibrated, and we are optimistic that demand driven by fundamental economic strength will continue to accelerate through the spring selling season.","We've noted consistently that the housing market is primarily driven by the deficit in housing production that has persisted for over a decade. This production deficit continues to define an overall shortage of housing in the country and has acted as a stabilizer as affordability has been tested. Supply of dwellings both for sale and for rent, continue to be short and underlying demand driven by the need for a place to live remain strong.","Against that backdrop, Lennar performed well in choppy conditions while deliveries missed the low end of guidance by 2%. This small miss was simply a shift in timing attributable to well-documented unusual weather conditions around the country. New orders on the other hand exceeded the upper end of our guidance by 5%, driven by improving demand progressively through the month of the quarter.","We achieved net earnings of almost $240 million this quarter and our strong cash position enables us to opportunistically repurchase another 1 million shares of stock and end up with a debt to total cap ratio of 38.5%, which is a 580 basis point improvement over last year. We expect to generate strong cash flow for the remainder of 2019 and expect to continue to use excess cash growth to both pay down debt while opportunistically repurchasing stock.","Additionally, our significant technology initiatives around the Company continue to be a significant reservoir of opportunity as we enhance our customer interface, create efficiencies in internal operation, reduce our SG&A and reduce our cost structure as well. We continue to be laser focused on progress on our technology adoption and change management as this is being incrementally reflected in bottom line improvement. We're still at the very beginning of the opportunities that we envision as we build a better mousetrap.","On a final note, we continue to focus on reverting to our core homebuilding platform by repositioning or opportunistically monetizing non-core assets and business lines in order to drive efficiencies and enhance cash flow. In the first quarter, we completed the sale of our real estate brokerage business as well as the sale of the majority of our retail title business and underwriter and our retail mortgage business.","Additionally, we contracted to sell our hospital in the Midwest a remnant asset from Rialto and that asset is expected to close in the second quarter. Before I turn over to Rick, Jon and Diane, let me just say that even with what has been a choppy housing market, we are very excited about our position and our business strategy and we're encouraged by recent market signals about the remainder of the year. Of course, we benefit from the size and scale we have amassed in each of our strategic markets and that's reflected in our consistent improvement in SG&A.","Through 2019, we'll be generating strong cash flow and bottom line profit, and we're continuing to use cash to reduce debt. Our balance sheet is strengthening while we use the weakness of markets to opportunistically repurchase shares. We are shedding non-core assets to generate additional cash and to partner with tech companies who can help enhance our customers experience while reducing overhead.","As the homebuilding market continues to stabilize and redefine itself in the wake of the recent pause, we are optimistic about the remainder of 2019. While Diane will give further Q2 guidance and some additional general direction on our full year expectations, based on our existing land position, our operating strategy and our dynamic pricing model, we will reiterate that we fully expect to deliver between 50,000 and 51,000 homes in 2019 with increased efficiency, improving margins through the year and with strong bottom line profitability and cash flow.","And with that, let me turn over to Rick.","Richard Beckwitt","Thanks, Stuart. In spite of somewhat softer market conditions, we achieved strong top and bottom-line growth in the first quarter. Revenues for the first quarter totaled 3.9 billion, representing a 31% increase from 2018. This was largely driven by a 30% increase in deliveries to 8,802 homes and a 4.1% increase in average sales price.","Deliveries for the quarter fell short of our Q4 guidance and were negatively affected by development and construction delays, driven by adverse weather conditions across the country. These deliveries will shift into our second quarter and some of our scheduled second quarter deliveries will shift into our third quarter.","We expect to return to a more even flow production schedule with non-weather affected build times by the end of Q2. However, notwithstanding construction weather delay, the accelerated starts in Q1 and successfully got on track with our internal start projections cumulatively through the end of Q1. Our gross margin totaled 2.1, 20.1% in the first quarter. While this was on the lower side of our prior guidance it was consistent with our Q4 announced strategy to price our inventory to market and to keep our production machine going.","We continue to believe that this is the right strategy and that higher operating margins and IRRs will increase shareholder value. Our SG&A in the quarter was 9.5%, this marks an all-time first quarter low and highlights the power of our increased local market scale and operating leverage. Homebuilding operating earnings on the sale of homes totaled 383 million in the quarter, up 48% from the prior year.","Our operating margin increased 80 basis points year-over-year we're particularly proud of the fact that our core homebuilding earnings are growing at a much faster rate than revenues once again demonstrating our increased operating efficiency. Net earnings for the quarter totaled 240 million up 76% from 2018. New orders for the quarter totaled 10,463 homes exceeding the high-end of our Q4 guidance by 5%.","Orders in the quarter were up 24% from the prior year with the dollar value of approximately 4.2 billion, representing a 23% increase. On a pro forma basis, new orders were down 4% from 2018 tied directly to a 4% decline in active communities from the prior year. The harsh weather in the quarter delayed many community openings, so we should be on track by the beginning of the third quarter with community count.","As I mentioned last quarter, the combination of higher sales prices and mortgage rates moderated demand in our fourth quarter, leading to reduced traffic, lower absorptions and increased sales incentives. During our first quarter, we saw a reversal of these trends driven by significantly lower mortgage rates and lower sales prices and\/or moderating sales price increases. These market changes spurred an increase in traffic on both our website and at our welcome home centers.","We saw this activity come first through our digital marketing programs and on-site community traffic picked up quickly thereafter. The combined impact of this increased traffic led to sequential increases in new orders in each month of our first quarter, with improved year-over-year performance in each month. Most importantly, we experienced this sequential order growth in every one of our 37 homebuilding divisions.","While some of this activity is clearly seasonal, we have seen a noticeable shift in homebuyer sentiment. In addition, while we did increase sales incentives in the first quarter by 20 basis points from the fourth quarter, we are optimistic that we've reached an inflection point and that incentives will start to decline as we enter the heart of the spring selling season.","In any case, we continue to price to market and use our dynamic pricing model to maximize price with the strategic focus on volume and higher operating margins over gross margins by themselves. We ended the first quarter with a sales backlog of 17,259 homes with a dollar value of $7.1 billion. This backlog combined with our current housing inventory puts us in a great position to achieve strong operating results in 2019.","I'd like to briefly discuss the recent changes by FHA designed to tighten the underwriting standards on FHA originated loans. FHA now requires lenders to manually underwrite loans that have both debt-to-income ratios above 43% and FICO scores below 620 rather than rely on the automated underwriting system. This is a reversion to a policy that was in place from 2013 to 2016.","While the loans can still be approved, the manual process takes slightly longer as it requires additional verifications, calculations and qualifying hurdles. The net impact of these changes to Lennar is insignificant. Based on our analysis of the loans that our Eagle Mortgage Company has made over the last five quarters we believe that less than 1% of our total loans would have been impacted by these changes.","Before I turn it over to Jon, let me give you a brief update on our land initiatives. The three strategic initiatives we discussed last quarter are up and running. Each vehicle is actively pursuing and underwriting new opportunities and moving forward with the entitlement and development of their previously existing portfolios.","In addition, we have expanded the geographic territory of two of these existing structures to include markets outside of Florida. This expanded footprint will increase our asset light land strategy in many more of our homebuilding operations. Lastly, we are continuing to use these existing structures and are in advanced discussions with several regional developers and other markets to expand this program.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jon.","Jonathan Jaffe","Thanks Rick. Today, I'm going to give an update on synergies, direct construction costs along with our production first operating platform and our SG&A leverage. First, we remain on track to achieve our prior guidance for 2019 of $380 million for merger synergies with 265 million of this from direct construction cost savings and 115 million from corporate and SG&A savings.","Next, I want to give some perspective on what we are accomplishing with our production first focus, what many of you refer to as pace over price. We've discussed for several quarters our goal of becoming the builder of choice for the construction trades. We articulated a program where we would utilize our significant size and scale in each market to forge new working relationships with our trade partners.","We've made the effort to work hand in hand with our trade partners to better understand how together we can maximize efficiencies that improve the bottom line profitability for our trade partners while lowering our construction costs and improving cycle time. Simply put, we've been on a mission to be the low cost preferred builder for the trades so they can in turn share these benefits back with us.","We're beginning to see the anticipated results from these efforts sequentially for the first quarter over the fourth quarter. We had a very small increase of just 0.6% in our average construction cost per square foot. This is meaningful as the industry still faces a headwind of the ongoing labor crisis, which puts pressure on labor costs along with material cost pressures that comes from tariffs, factory labor shortages, stricter energy codes and all without the benefit of the lower lumber cost which will materialize later in the year.","As we highlighted last quarter, we are focused on our production machine, delivering to the trades even slow starts and delivery throughout the year. We presented this plans to trades in all of our divisions and delivered on the plan on Q1 by guarding the homes we committed to. As Rick noted, we have to deal with some extreme wet weather conditions that interfered with the goal of evenly, spreading our production, but we still delivered on the commitments to start the homes we set to work.","Many of our trade partners that we stood out and maintaining our start during fourth and first quarter while many of our peers pulled back on and start to sales slowed during this time. The combination of working with trade to strategic partners, our commitment to even slow production and simplicity of everything included, all work to create an environment with more and more trades are concluding at Lennar their builder of choice.","With our combined size and scale we\u2019re able to leverage our SG&A turn offline, first quarter low 9.5%. A big contributor to this improvement is our continued focus on the sales process which has reduced our average realtor commission down to 2.27% in Q1, an improvement of 26 basis points year-over-year and 12 basis points sequentially from Q4. This reduction in cost is a result of our efforts to reach our customers early in the process to our digital general marketing campaigns.","We had over 190,000 total internet leads in Q1 a year-over-year increase of 32%. In internet leads someone who specifically requests the information from us. These leads are extended to immediately buy one of our internet sales consultants who are based in each one of our divisions. Their responsibility is to help the customers decide which community is right for them and then set an appointment for the customer to visit that community and follow up with the customer to remind there another appointment or to reschedule as needed.","This produces a high quantity of high quality leads for our community-based new home consultants and on a scheduled appointment basis. I will conclude by noting the plan will improve our net operating margin, free cash flow and return on capital is proving now. Its execution is built on four pillars, one our builder choice production first operational platform which drives cost down.","Two, our just in time selling platform driven by our dynamic pricing model which allows us to, obviously, price to current market conditions; three, a technology driven efficiently levered overhead structure; and four, our everything included platform that simplifies the homebuilding process while providing great value to the home buyer.","I would now like to turn it over to Diane.","Diane Bessette","Thank you, John and good morning to everyone. So let me summarize and reemphasize a few two points from our first quarter and so starting with homebuilding. As you've heard looking at deliveries, our actual Q1 2019 deliveries increased 30% from the prior year Q1 2018 deliveries and decreased 12% from pro forma Q1 2018 deliveries. These pro forma deliveries included CalAtlantic December 2017 deliveries which was the last month of its fiscal year and does not truly comparable.","Our first quarter gross margins on home sales was 20.1%, the prior year gross margin was 19.5% or 21.6% excluding CalAtlantic purchase accounting write-up of backlog and construction in progress. Our Q1 2019 gross margins were impacted by an increase in sales incentive consistent with our focus on pace and then increase in construction cost due to the high point of lumber prices in 2018 slowing through Q1 delivery.","As you've heard us say, our first quarter SG&A was 9.5% compared to 9.7% in the prior year. The decrease was due to improved operating leverage as a result of increased size and scale as well as our continued focus on obtaining benefits from our technology initiatives as John detailed.","And then turning to new orders, new orders increased 24% and new order dollar increases 22% for the first quarter primarily results of the CalAtlantic acquisition. Our Q1 2019, new order decreased 4% from pro forma Q1 2018, new orders, and committed accounts decreased at the same rate and that\u2019s the drops in full flat year-over-year pro forma near at 2.7. Our Q1 cancelation rate was about 17%.","And finally, the Q1 2019, homebuilding joint venture, land sales and other categories, we had a combine loss of $13.2 million compared to our $154.5 million earnings in the prior year. But remember that last year, included a gain of approximately $165 million related to the sale of an 80% interest in one of our homebuilding joint venture. And then turning to financial services, again as you've heard us say, consistent with our reversion to pure play homebuilder.","During the first quarter, our financial services segment sold the majority of its retail title agency business and title insurer underwriter -- insurance underwriter, its retail mortgage business and its real estate brokerage business, but these transactions resulted in a net gain of approximately of $1.6 million. As a result of these strategic transactions, financial services headcount has been reduced from approximately 3,200 at year end to approximately 1,700 after the completion of these transactions.","And then just to add a little more color on the largest transaction, which was a sale of our retail title agency business and title insurance underwriter. So, we sold the majority of these operations to States Title as we previously announced. In connections with this transaction, we provided seller financing and received substantial minority equity ownership State in States Title. Combination of both the equity and debt components of their transaction did not meet the accounting requirement of sales treatment and therefore, as you look at our number you'll see that we will require to consolidate States Title results at this time.","So then looking at the components of financial services operating earnings net of, not at net of non-control measures related to States Title combined with $21.8 million compared to $25.9 million in the prior year and the detail of the component are as follows. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $40.9 million from $14.5 million in the prior year. Total originations were relatively flat at $1.9 billion for both Q1 2019 and Q1 2018.","Originations in Q1 2019 included increased volume related to a full quarter of CalAtlantic offset by a decline in volumes due to the sale of the retail business. Title operating earnings increase to $5.9 million from $5.4 million in the prior year. Even though, there was a decrease in the number of Title transactions due to the business is sold, operating earnings increased as a result of additional transactions related a full quarter of CalAtlantic and a focus of cost reductions to right size the business.","And then, one point to note regarding financial services, in connection with Rialto investment and asset management platform sale in the fourth quarter of 2018. Rialto mortgage finance or RMF has moved into our financial services segment, and as such, our prior period information has been adjusted to confirm with the current presentation. And so looking at our RMF, for the first quarter of 2019, their operating earnings were about break even compared to 6.5 million in the prior year. This decrease was due to lower securitization volume and margins during the quarter, as compared to the prior year.","And then looking at Multifamily, in the first quarter our Multifamily segment had operating earnings of 6.8 million compared to an operating loss of 1.2 million in the prior year. In this first quarter, we recorded 15.5 million related to sales during the quarter and 1.8 million of promote revenue related to the stabilization of properties in our LMV fund. As we've noted for a while, we have been moving from a build-to-sell to a build-to-hold platform, earnings fees and promote by creating value within our fund.","And then finally, other just a small note, you'll see that new category on our balance sheet and P&L. So, as a reminder, we've combined with the remaining Rialto assets, which are primarily the fund investments and our strategic technology investments into this category effective December 1st, earnings of 3 million in Q1, 2019 compared to 4 million in the prior year.","Turning to the balance sheet, at February 28, we ended the quarter with 853 million of cash. We had borrowings on our revolving credit facility of 725 million, moving about 1.5 billion of the available capacity. At quarter end, our homebuilding debt to total cap was 38.5%. And during the quarter as Stuart mentioned, we repurchased 1 million shares for a total of approximately 47 million.","At the end of the quarter, our home sites owned and controlled were 278,000 of which 210,000 are owned and 68,000 are controlled. And stockholders' equity increased to 14.8 billion and our book value per share, grew to 45.75 per share. So now turning to guidance, I'd like to provide some guidance for the second quarter. Starting with homebuilding, we expect new orders between 14,000 and 14,300. We expect to deliver between 11,700 and 12,000 homes.","We expect our Q2 average sales price to be between 400,000 and 405,000. We expect our Q2 gross margins to be in the range of 20% to 20.5%, and our SG&A to be in the range of 8.5% to 8.6%. And for the combined category of homebuilding joint ventures, land sales and other we expect a Q2 loss of approximately 10 million to 15 million.","And then turning to our ancillary businesses, we believe our financial services earnings will be between 45 million and 47 million. We believe our Multifamily earnings will be about a $5 million loss. And for the other category related to the Rialto legacy assets and our strategic investments, we expect a Q2 loss of approximately 10 million.","We expect our Q2 corporate G&A to be about 1.6 of total revenue and our tax rate to be about 25.5%. Our share count should be about 321 million shares. This guidance should produce an EPS range of dollars $1.7 to $1.20 for the quarter. And then turning to fiscal 2019, given that we believe the market is a bit less uncertain and on more solid ground, we thought it would be helpful to provide a few additional data points for the full year 2019. This guidance is still preliminary and we will adjust as the year progresses.","So starting with delivery, we expect as Stuart mentioned to deliver between 50,000 and 51,000 homes. We believe our average sales price will remain relatively flat from current level, so approximately 400,000 to 405,000. Our gross margin is expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%, and our SG&A in the range of 8.3% to 8.5%. And then finally, a couple of comments regarding our ancillary businesses, financial services earnings should be in the range of 185 million to 190 million, and then our Multifamily earnings should be in the range of 5 million to 10 million.","This reflects our migration from a build-to-sell to a delta of full platform. Strategic change means that instead of having GAAP earnings as we sell assets, we will have additional accumulation of profit that will be recognized in the future as assets are completed and stabilized. The estimate of our shares accumulated changes in fair value is approximately a 150 million on 21completed and stabilized assets in our LNV Fund I, as we compare the market value of our investment to our basis, as additional assets complete and stabilize, this amount should increase.","So in summary, we believe we are well positioned to have strong profitability and cash flow generation in 2019, and we look forward to reporting our progress in future quarters.","And so with that, I would like to turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Buck Horne","Just could you start with walking us through the map and just characterize what you're seeing in terms of demand trend and absorption phases geographically? And maybe by price point and just any other factors with certain markets for example foreign buyers in California as an example? Any color there would be helpful.","Jonathan Jaffe","And particularly in California, we saw in the first quarter the same pattern Rick described nationally, which was each month sequentially we've saw an improvement in traffic and the quality of that traffic and in sales. And we saw, what we expected which should be a recovery for us in the more affordable California markets of the Central Valley and Sacramento, and a slightly slower recovery in the more expensive coastal market Bay Area, Orange County and San Diego.","Richard Beckwitt","Yes, this is Rick. As I said in my comments, we saw sequential increases each month, each quarter by in every division that we have. From that an overall standpoint, we started in the December month with a negative comparison year-over-year, and got finally to in February a positive variance that netted to our 4% down for the quarter. You saw increases in absorption pace months-to-months in months throughout the quarter, and that was pretty much across every market that we saw.","Jonathan Jaffe","So, it sounds like the trends in the margins or the margins in the backlog are stabilizing and\/or improving. I'm just wondering, is that a function of any changes in the product mix you're making? Or is that the expectation of reduced incentives going forward that would affect the rest of 2019? And are there other tailwinds in the margins that whether it\u2019s lumber, labor or production synergies you could quantify.","Richard Beckwitt","So, I will start out with the backlog and Diane\u2019s guidance with regard to Q2. The sales that we generated in the first quarter and some of the sales that we generated in the fourth quarter that will close in our second quarter are affected by some of the incentives that we use to move our inventory. As we said, we are focused on our production model and really geared towards net operating margins, but some of those sales will have a higher incentive in them and as a result have a lower gross margin. As we look through the year, we\u2019re optimistic that will be able to get to a point where we have to offer less incentives to keep that production pace up. We\u2019re just beginning the heart of sales season now and we will have to see how the year goes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Stephen Kim","Good job in a tough environment. Wanted to ask you, Stuart, about your overall comment about the industry taking a natural pause last year, I mean I just want to make sure that when we get your perspective clearly, now that last year sort of in the record books and we sort of gotten back to a little bit of a normalized environment, because obviously rates are continuing to be little bit jumpy. So, when we look at the decline in demand that occurred last year in the back half really beginning in the middle of the year, I think you\u2019re characterizing it now than the industry taking a natural pause. But you didn't specifically call out the mortgage rates sort of moving north to 4.5%, but I think a lot of people sort of keyed in on that because 4.5% mortgage rate was a little lower than I think most people's thought would be the threshold above which demand would take a pause. And so, as we go forward here with last year in the record books, do you believe that 4.5% represents an important threshold or do you believe that because we now have another year of economic growth that maybe a threshold that might be in line which should be like a 5% mortgage rate. Just want to get your sense of the interplay the mortgage rates in your generalized outlook for what happened last year -- I\u2019m sorry your reflection on what\u2019s happened last year and what you think will happen as we go forward over the next couple of years.","Stuart Miller","So, let me go back to my comments, Steve, and highlight that both last quarter and this quarter, I have talked about this natural pause in terms of two components. An accelerated rate of increase in ASP which we have seen for a number of quarters together with a very rapid increase in interest rates, and the reason I articulated it last quarter and even in the third quarter, as the beginning to the natural pause at that time is the rate at which sales prices had been moving up was outside of a normal rate. And when you layered on top of that a very quick sticker shock approach to interest rates moving up, it just created a miss match between buyers need and buyers expectation, and I felt that it was a natural sticker shock that came from the rapidity with which rates and ASP were moving.","So when I think about things today, we've seen moderation on both fronts as articulated, both on the price depreciation, we have seen price depreciation, certainly slow down. I said I used the word stall and even pull back in my comments. And we have seen that in various markets we have seen, price depreciation really pull back quite a bit in response to demand subsiding. But additionally layering on top of that we've seen a serious reduction in interest rates. And the combination of the two has really brought the market back kind of into what I think of as equilibrium. The economy has continued to be fairly strong. Unemployment has been low. We've seen wages increasing. We've seen participation rate increasing and that reflects itself in more dual income families.","And so these are the things that we\u2019re seeing at our welcome home centers, as people come to visit with us, that interest rates together with average sales price, together with general economy moving in the right direction has really set a stage of stability right now in terms of the market moving forward. Now against that back drop, remember that home production, the production deficit that I keep referencing, we still haven't seen home production yet to what most people still think is a normalized 1.5 million homes per year. We have been decidedly well below that number for a very long period of time. And so, we still have a housing shortage, people need a place to live, affordability has been tested, that affordability test has been pulled back. And so, we kind of look forward and think that the market looks pretty good. ","As to your question about 4.5% rate is that some kind of an inflection point, I think it has more to do with the rapidity at which rate, interest rate moves together with average sales price alongside of an improving economy. And I think that what we saw in the third quarter and fourth quarter was it just happened too quickly and created sticker shock.","Richard Beckwitt","And Steve, just one another point on that, as we said in Q4, we didn't see a qualification issue with regard to people when they locked in at the home they could afford. And it was just really a mismatch between buyer expectation and what products they could buy. And now, that has been reset and so I'd like rebooting a computer. And that's why, Stuart, gotten to the point where we got positive were back in action here.","Stephen Kim","Talking about the rapidity with which ASPs are increasing. Obviously, you've got to make shift that's been going on as you can target anymore affordable price points and all that, which has been absolutely the right move. But one other thing to be part is that the ASP at the entry level is in many cases has been over the last couple of years growing at two to even three times the rate of the market overall. And so that sort of hidden there and that sort of ASP mix blended mix. And so, I was curious as to when you talk about ASP the thing that you are envisioning in an environment where ASP growth is going to be a little bit more moderate, little bit more sustained -- at a sustainable level. Did you -- when you\u2019re talking about, are you talking about slowdown in the pace of ASP growth at the entry level as well? And then as a back half of that question -- you talked about the FHA. My question on the FHA is, were you surprised at the timing of the move -- were you surprised that they made that move the way they did when they did or did you expect that? ","Stuart Miller","Well, let me start with the ASP question and by the way we're noting that you squeezed two questions into one. So as it relates to ASP, ASP's have been moving up in part because of short supply and in part because the cost structures have been moving up as we've seen that even more at the lower end. It's very difficult to produce affordable housing at lower prices, given land costs and production costs. But there has been a pause in ASP at all price points that was generated by both interest rates and an accelerated increase in price. And I think this is exactly why you've seen us shift and focus so dramatically to size and scale in local market, using size and scale to recalibrate both our building partner program, our Builder of Choice program to moderate the acceleration of construction costs and as well our laser focus on technology and recalibrating our SG&A because we recognize that affordability is going to be tested if prices keep getting driven up by the cost structure and we've got to do some things to offset that. And we've working really hard at that. So I think you're seeing that prices are going to have some caps to them defined by affordability and the challenge for the building community is going to be the rationalized cost both at the SG&A level and the cost structure level to accommodate what is likely to be slower price increases. And you\u2019ve seen that yesterday in Case-Shiller the acceleration of price increases is lower and I think that that\u2019s a little bit behind the curve, we\u2019re still going to see that come down. I think that\u2019s going to be more the wave of the future. And as it relates to FHA, I\u2019m going to let Rick go ahead and hit that. ","Richard Beckwitt","We weren\u2019t particularly surprised with the timing or the announcement. This has been something that\u2019s been rumbling for a while. And -- but, as I said the net impact to us is de minimis. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. ","Michael Eisen","Actually, Mike Eisen on for Mike Dahl. Just wanted to follow up on some those comments that you guys have made a few times now about pricing resets or more moderating pricing environment. And I was hoping you would talk to for Lennar products specifically. What you guys are doing from a strategy standpoint whether it be taking down base prices, whether it be smaller square footage and how you guys are addressing this and then how -- where specific regions you are seeing the most success with this strategy? ","Richard Beckwitt","Jon you want to start off?","Jonathan Jaffe","Sure. For the most part we -- this was the very market-by-market approach that Lennar takes with this product. So we will have some markets where we have taken square footage down San Antonio, Texas, as an example, and we will have other markets where the land basis really doesn\u2019t allow for that to happen on the other end of the extreme in Orange County, California, where square footage hasn\u2019t reduced and price points remain at a higher overall level. Our big focus, as you've heard from all three of us, has been on how do we really moderate our cost structure, so that at whatever price we're trying to target whether it\u2019s entry level first time move up, second time move up buyer, we can be price affordably in the marketplace against the competition, against the resale market as a value to that consumer. So laser focused on efficient production program to really keep the price points down recognizing that affordability at each price point is an issue and we got to be very responsive to that.","Richard Beckwitt","Yes, so just to get to the second point -- portion of your question with regard to product adjustments, we are very laser focused on what features we should include in our Everything's Included product to capture the best value and provide the best -- best margin for us and provide the best value for our customers. So we look at footprints, we look at included features, we make adjustments, we have regional opportunities going on right now. So we're very focused on that. From a footprint basis in parts of Texas and some of the Carolinas you\u2019ll see that we're starting to deliver a little bit smaller home. And if you look at just general pricing, on our sales for the last quarter, we were flat year-over-year with regard to ASP, some of that is mix, but some of that is just lower prices on a year-over-year basis. Our backlog year-over-year is down about -- average price and backlog is down about 6%. So that gives you a true look at some of the pricing adjustments that we have made. But as Jon and Diane said, shouldn\u2019t really impact our margin going forward.","Jonathan Jaffe","Just to follow up on the point that Rick made, Everything's Included platform really allows us to deliver a better value to the customer because they're getting more included features without having to pay extra for it. A good example of that I was just chatting this morning with our folks in Indianapolis, through the regional president, and there they've gone from a complete CalAtlantic division and our presence there to converting their product to Everything's Included. And what they are finding is, with the offering -- the value offering of Everything\u2019s Included their sales pace is picking up in the same communities with the same product, so that product offered at lower price, more value features included and no options available to the customer. So that allows us also address the issue of affordability.","Michael Eisen","Got it, appreciate all the color there, very helpful. And then just following up taking some of those comments and applying them to the impact on gross margins down the road, it seems that there's a few different buckets between the synergies, cost savings, lower lumber that are working in your favor offset by lower pricing, and just the desire to be higher velocity. So can you help us think longer term as you guys are operating this higher volume business model? How we can think about margins moving back higher -- some of the higher levels we've seen over the last few years or if this 20.5% to 21% is a new normal for what the company can do? Thanks and good luck.","Richard Beckwitt","Well, maybe I'll take a crack at it. I think we\u2019re one of the only companies right now -- the only company that\u2019s given full year guidance. And we really do not like to get over our SKUs and get into years outside of the current fiscal year.","Stuart Miller ","So let me add to that and say, with that said, while we\u2019re taking a conservative look forward as we look at the rest of this year recognizing that we\u2019re coming out of the choppy market, we will wait and see exactly how this spring selling season shapes up. We haven\u2019t just taken pricing as it\u2019s come. Remember that we have spent a lot of time focusing on our cost structure using the tools that we've acquired through size and scale and through various technologies to really recalibrate our cost structure and to recalibrate our SG&A. And while the progress is incremental, and some times a little bit slower than we\u2019d like, it is always with regard to our focus on the net margin that we see -- we\u2019re driving all of our internal strategies. So when you listen to Jon talk about the cost structure and Builder of Choice initiatives and things like that these are all focused on generating a higher gross margin. When you hear me talk about our building a better mousetrap and generating lower SG&A and recalibrating our internal mechanisms and our customer interface, it\u2019s all about generating a lower or a higher net margin, lower SG&A. So while we recognize that the market might be choppy, might be a little up, might be a little bit down and as we think ahead, we know some of these initiatives will produce results that might be slower than expected, we can't predict them exactly but we're focused on both the cost side of the business as well as what the pricing might be. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman Associates. Your line is now open. ","Alan Ratner ","Nice quarter and thanks for all the color here, great to hear about the improvement in the market. First question on the 2Q guide, if I heard it correctly on the orders, I just wanted to dig in a little bit more. It seems like you expect orders to still be down a little bit year-over-year which given the momentum you saw through the quarter and slipping to positive in February would seem a little bit surprising. So can you just talk a little bit more about what\u2019s going into that, is that a function of the weather delays you experienced and kind of how do you see that playing out?","Richard Beckwitt","Jon, let me start off. Some of that is just a function of we\u2019ve got a bunch of communities closing out this quarter and we have communities that will get back on track, but it is really late in the quarter. So you\u2019re seeing a reflection of the number of sales opportunities we have for community count. And Jon, I\u2019ll further to you now. ","Jonathan Jaffe","Just that I would make the same point. As you look at, for us projected sales pace for Q2 of \u201819 is actually right on top of the sales pace that we had in Q2 of \u201818. So it\u2019s just community count that\u2019s driving the result that you\u2019re highlighting but we feel very good about our position given that we\u2019re projecting a sales pace that\u2019s equivalent with last year. ","Alan Ratner ","So then just to hit the year-end or the full year target then, it seem like a pretty healthy ramp in the back half of the year. Can you just talk a little bit about what your starts growth looks like to support that level of growth?","Jonathan Jaffe","We have a natural increase as we moved through the year. We\u2019re, as I mentioned and we all mentioned, trying to level that out throughout the year but we still haven't increased in starts as we move from first quarter to second, into third, so our second and third quarter are our largest for starts. Third and fourth will still be our largest for deliveries, but even this year that's beginning to moderate up compared to prior years.","Alan Ratner ","Got it, okay. And if I could just add a second one, a separate topic, the iBuyer your Opendoor investment, curious maybe Stuart if you can give us an update on how that's been progressing, in how many markets is that kind of being active in right now and what percentage of your orders is the buyer actually utilizing that on their resale? ","Stuart Miller","So first of all, we're really enthusiastic about our program with Opendoor, first of all Opendoor has just tremendous management team that has a very aggressive agenda in rolling out -- not only rolling out to new markets, but more importantly refining their business model, focusing on both their customer interface and their use in the economics. And this is a team that is just best in class. Jon Jaffe has the privilege of serving on the Board there. And what we have is -- and I'll let Jon talk a little bit more about it in a second, but what we have is a rollout program where as Opendoor enters each new market we have a side-by-side launch with them of an Opendoor program within our division. And what we have done is we've really mapped out a change management adoption program to include the Opendoor tool in our toolbox whereas we have customers who come to visit us and say, \u201cJeez, I love your offering but I have a home to sell.\u201d We can turn to them and say \u201cWe have a solution.\u201d And that mechanism for rethinking the way that we work with our customers in taking the friction out of the trade up and the move up programs that we have in our system is really working well. ","Opendoor on its own in, its own world is doing quite well but in coordination with Lennar we're finding greater and greater and accelerated adoption of the program as we go market-by-market. I have to admit I\u2019ve lost track of exactly how many markets they are in together with us right now but we are monitoring market-by-market month-by-month how many Opendoor enabled sales we are achieving and we're really enthusiastic about the program. Jon? ","Jonathan Jaffe","Just yesterday we opened our 18th market with Opendoor in Austin, Texas. And as Stuart noted, it's been a great learning process as we have jointly with Opendoor, presented to our operating division, to our sales team the Opendoor platform. Our divisions eagerly await the opening of that in their market and we're finding lessons learned in process towards each opening, execution is better and better than the prior one. We have some of our first division has reached a activity level of 20 transactions a month, that's in Phoenix, and we're seeing as I said just better and better execution. So we're very excited about that. We view it as incremental buyers. It reduces our cancellation rate as it\u2019s a solution to our buyers that have home to sell and it also helps lower our growth spend that buyer very often will reach earlier in the process and they don\u2019t have a broker yet, so they are not involved in the equation. So as Stuart said, we\u2019re extremely enthusiastic about the program. We got a great working relationship with the management team there. We are working hand-in-hand to learn from each other. We learn technology from them, they learn operations and real estate from us, and we\u2019re both improving from that. ","Stuart Miller ","Let me add one more point here since you've open the door on Opendoor, maybe the most important thing that we are learning, and this is where we are working around the clock is we are learning about change management, change management from the way things have worked and worked quite well to a progressively better way to interact with our customer and pull friction out of our program and migrate our associates to understand that there is a better way to transact. And that change management process has friction points of its own. We are learning as we are doing and we are evolving our ability to communicate internally and that something is perhaps one of the most exciting parts of the program. We're going to get better and better at this, not just with Opendoor but with Blend, with States Title and with others that we are engaged with, with Hippo. Our technology initiatives are -- we have a great deal of enthusiasm for them but our ability to integrate and work with them is getting better and better all the time. Last question?","Operator","Our last question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Michael Rehaut ","I have just one question in 27 parts, just kidding obviously. First question just on incentives. I was hoping to get a better sense, you talked about the market being choppy in -- throughout the quarter, but at the same time improving as mortgage rates perhaps and other -- the spring selling season progressed. I was wondering how that\u2019s related to incentives as they progressed throughout the quarter and in particular what you saw across parts of California?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, throughout the quarter as I said, we continue to incentivize in order to move our completed product. And this is something we're going to continue to do in each period as we priced our inventory to market using our dynamic pricing model. We believe that as we moved into Q2 and to Q3 the level of incentives is going to start to dissipate, and we\u2019ve started to see that through conversations that we've had with homeowners as we moved through the quarter. ","Jonathan Jaffe","And with respect to California, Michael, we definitely are consistent with what I said earlier in the more affordable market Central Valley, Sacramento, the incentives are proportionally lower than they are on the coastal markets, and then all those markets, particularly the central markets, we did see lessening incentives towards the end of the first quarter and the coastal markets, let\u2019s say, just as Rick was saying that we use those incentives to generate the sales pace improvement in those markets. ","Michael Rehaut ","Okay. Now thank you for that. I guess secondly, just shifting gears a little bit to return on equity. You've obviously highlighted some of the initiatives that you are doing in terms of returning to your core business, selling off some different businesses as you highlighted with different parts of the brokerage and title et cetera. How do you see over the next two or three years, where do you want to be in terms total assets sales or as it relates to kind of slimming down your balance sheet let's say, as well as share repurchase because when you look at ROE and that has had a pretty powerful relationship between that metric and valuation multiples. And with your ROE being below some of your larger cap peers, where do you want to see that metric go and what you are willing to do in terms of again additional asset sales or more aggressive share repurchase for instance to get there? ","Stuart Miller ","So, we are very focused on return on equity and Jon -- and I -- let me just say I think we\u2019re going to try to get one more question in the call. But I think that a combination of generating strong earnings and that strong earnings power coming from in part what we're doing relative to our SG&A is going to be a primary driver of stronger ROE. As we've an opportunity to continue to pare down ancillary businesses, as we've said, we're going to do that but we are not going to force the issue. We think that there are intrinsic values to the assets that we have, whether it\u2019s LMV multi-family program or whether it\u2019s FivePoint. So we're not going to force the issue as we haven\u2019t with Rialto. But we're going to migrate to a core business strategy, that\u2019s where are focus is going to be. And we are certainly going to be focused on using technology, those internal initiative and external to increase bottom line. Let's go to one more question. Operator? ","Operator","Yes, we do have a few questions in the queue.","Stuart Miller","Let's take one more.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. ","Stephen East","Thank you for squeezing me in there Stuart. First you got this big combined company. You all have talked now about the developer agreements and starting to get them off the ground some. Could you talk about maybe, first of all what geographies are you in if you are willing to talk about that yet? And then as you look at your ability to option more land at a faster pace maybe -- or can you all talk a little bit about where you are with that process and how fast you think you can accelerate your optioning of land asset? ","Richard Beckwitt","So it\u2019s Rick, Stephen. As I mentioned last quarter, the deals that we brought into place, the three deals catapulted us to about a 30% control position and we expect that over the next 18 months will be north of 40% based on the arrangements that we\u2019ve got in place. This is -- it\u2019s a program -- just sort of getting back to that last question, what\u2019s the biggest mover with regard to where we can enhance our return on equity, it\u2019s moving to an asset light program that Stuart really identified our pivot going back two or three years ago. So we are going to continue this on. You will see a higher concentration of deliveries coming from vehicles like this. And as I said last quarter given the type of arrangement that we have in our right to purchase from these things without a contract, you may not necessarily see them directly in our controlled owned count because of the way that they are structured. And as far as the markets, we\u2019ve expanded them to other parts of the Southeast. Let\u2019s just leave it there. ","Stephen East","Alright, fair enough. And then on your community growth, a more immediate question and a bigger picture question. When will you turn positive you think in your community growth this year? And then as you think about your business in a broader sense, how fast would you all be satisfied growing your communities and really your unit growth if you will, just a big picture question? ","Richard Beckwitt","Yes. So really by the time we get into Q3, first month of Q3 you'll start to see a flat year-over-year community count. We had a double whammy come in this last quarter. We had a bunch of communities closing out where just because we had a good programs going on with regard to sales activity and we had about 30 communities that were delayed because of the weather did get us going. So we will start to see a more normalized year-over-year comparison as we get into Q3. And as we said, we plan to grow community count as we move forward in the market.","Stephen East","So from a bigger picture, where would you be comfortable and how do you think about your unit growth over time?","Richard Beckwitt","As we\u2019ve said in the past, we think that we want to grow our business about a minimum of 3% to 5% to 7% with regard to unit activity. Some of that will be associated with a little bit higher absorption since the market recovers on a community-by-community basis but some of that is going to be tied to incremental community growth. But really our zip code is 5% to7% for the next year or a year or two. ","Stuart Miller ","Okay, we\u2019re going to wrap it up there. I want to say that I appreciate everybody joining and let me just circle back to where we started and that is we highlighted that we felt that the home building market had entered a pause in third and fourth quarter. We found evidence of stabilization in the first as we migrated to our first quarter. We look forward to checking back and giving an update on how we\u2019re going from here. But with that said, we are optimistic that the housing market has found a firm ground and is ready to move forward. Thank you for joining. We\u2019ll speak to you next quarter.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart A. Miller","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2012 update. We're very pleased to detail our results for you this morning, and we have a lot of ground to cover. As always, I'm joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; David Collins, our Controller. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of our Rialto segment are here to participate as well, and of course, you just heard from Allison Bober.","I'm going to begin this morning with some brief opening remarks about the state of the current housing market in general and about our second quarter results, and then Rick and Jon will comment on specific aspects of Lennar's Homebuilding operations. And Jeff will update performance on our Rialto segment. David Collins is going to also give a 5-minute primer on our deferred tax asset reversal. And finally, Bruce will provide detail on our first quarter numbers. After Bruce, of course, we'll open the phone lines to your questions. [Operator Instructions]","So as I sit here today, I couldn't be more pleased with the progress that our company has made and continues to make as we work through this historic downturn. The associates throughout our company have worked tirelessly to pull through the toughest of times to revamp our business from top to bottom and to move forward to stable profitability. The reversal of our deferred tax asset reserve this quarter is really a tacit recognition of a job well done, and it's symbolic of having accomplished a great deal to bring Lennar back to a strong go-forward position. And in that regard, I want to thank all of the associates of our company for their commitment and care, which are at the core of the culture of our company.","The reversal of our deferred tax asset reserve this quarter is, as I noted before, really symbolic rather than a significant financial event. It represents that the company has really achieved a stabilized financial condition, consistent profitability and even a modicum of visibility as well. It also represents that the macro housing market has stabilized, has most likely bottomed and perhaps is beginning the road to recovery.","I've noted over the last few quarters that we've been seeing consistent improvement in both traffic and demand activity in our communities. This has acted as confirmation that both the housing market and the overall economy are stabilizing and that a very real trend is beginning to take shape. The overall housing market is different now than it has been in the past several years. There are discernible, fundamental shifts that are driving the home market, and there are empirical data points that are, to date, confirming the market is really showing signs of stability.","With that said, and as we saw from yesterday's Case-Shiller information and last week's home sales data, the housing market is not yet in full recovery as the actual data is still slightly negative in some instances. In fact, the stabilization process after a full 7-year decline in housing is still somewhat rocky and erratic and is certainly not yet broad-based.","Our management team has just completed our quarterly operations review with all of our division presidents. Let me tell you what we're seeing in the field and how we're thinking about the market versus national numbers that are being reported. We're seeing that various important themes are primary drivers of today's housing market.","First, today's consumers looking at the home purchase differently than in past years. Today's buyers are looking for real value as defined by low purchase price, low interest rate and affordable and competitive monthly payments. The home purchase is not seen as a place to invest savings in order to ride the wave of price increases. Since home prices and volumes are low and interest rates are at historic lows, affordability is at extremely high levels. Today's consumers are realizing that housing represents an undeniable value proposition. They are finding real value in today's for-sale housing, and we're hearing this from them regularly in the field. Accordingly, for the past few quarters now, we've been experiencing more traffic in our Welcome Home Centers, and customers are actively discussing their desire to find a way to purchase and capitalize on current market conditions.","A second trend is that purchasers are beginning to feel pressure to make the home purchase so that they do not miss this moment in time. The feeling of missing the boat is becoming a common discussion and is being reinforced by discussion with family and friends. Buying a home -- buying and owning a home is not only no longer taboo at the dining room table, it is being viewed as a measure of financial stability again. This trend will continue to drive demand and sentiment as more data becomes positive as the press continues to highlight recovery and as inventory in the field continues to deplete.","Next, consumers are becoming acutely aware of the comparative value in monthly payments and a mortgage monthly payment versus a rental monthly payment. The fully loaded cost of ownership is simply lower in most desirable markets than comparable rental rates. As I've noted in past conference calls, we have and continue to carefully study this trend and continue to find that in local competitive markets, principal interest, taxes, insurance, community, association and lawn care are together lower than the competitive rental market. Today, for-sale housing represents an excellent value proposition on a pure monthly payment basis versus renting.","Rental prices are high, and they've been moving up as well. Today's consumer is looking for living cost stability, as well as a stable and safe place to raise the family. Accordingly, today's housing consumer is seeking to avoid the rental market and the annual repricing inherent in rental rates.","Fourth, consumers recognize that the mortgage approval process is extremely conservative and it is very difficult to get approved. Expectations are aligning with the new realities of the mortgage market, and consumers desirous of purchasing and getting approved are becoming more realistically in touch with their own credit credentials in order to be approved. Rather than fighting the process and leaving in frustration, consumers are working within today's parameters to provide the burdensome paperwork, accumulate the required money down and enhance their credit credentials to get to the finish line.","Fifth, inventories are declining. While there might be national statistics that suggest otherwise or suggest that foreclosure backlog and delinquencies are still a looming problem, we are finding that inventory overhang is diminishing in many markets and that available for-sale housing is becoming more scarce.","Additionally, with the government's recasting of HARP 2.0, that is the home refinance program for performing but underwater loan, there are far fewer strategic defaults as more owners are refinancing and appreciating a lower monthly payment.","Finally, improvement in employment and consumer confidence is finally translating into the end of negative household formation. The trend of children moving home and elderly parents moving in with children is at least slowing and starting to reverse. Over time, this trend will be an even more powerful driver of demand. I have always noted that it is generally 6 to 12 months after households double up that everyone realizes that this was just not a good idea. As the economy improves, doubled-up households can afford to unwind, and this is beginning to happen.","Overall, demand has been improving, and we've seen consistent sales pace at stabilized prices through our second quarter as a continuation of a trend from our prior quarters. Our steady traffic and sales rate indicate stronger demand trends than prior years, and we have seen an increase in our monthly sales per community as well. And these improved results are coming with prices and margins that are consistent or marginally better than our current deliveries, indicating that we are not and have not been reaching for volume.","With these trends identified, I do not want to overstate the case for housing. While the trend is discernibly positive, stabilization and recovery are uneven across the country and even within markets. The housing depression was a national phenomenon, while the recovery is decidedly very local. We're seeing pockets of activity develop across the country not by region or by state but on a very localized basis. And these pockets are recovering while the broader market outside of these pockets often remains weak. But at present, these pockets are growing.","Additionally, demand remains constrained by the mortgage qualification standards and processes and a difficult appraisal environment that define today's mortgage market that has been overcorrected by the severity of the downturn. But demand is growing, and more and more customers are pushing to fit within the boundaries of credit standards while the government has recognized that the pendulum has swung too far and is pushing for some loosening of credit standards as well.","Let me briefly turn to Lennar specifically as our management team will give additional color on our results. In our second quarter, we saw fundamental improvement in all of the building blocks that define our Homebuilding and Financial Services operations, while Rialto continued to build and augment its blue-chip operating platform. Each of our operating segments has remained profitable in the second quarter as our associates across the country are executing on all fronts.","On the homebuilding front, closings were up 20%. New orders increased 40%. Our backlog improved 61%, and gross margins of 22.5% translated into our healthy operating margin of 9.2% as SG&A declined to 13.2%. We're beginning to see the impact of the operating leverage that we expected as the market stabilizes. As we look ahead to future quarters, our strategy of focusing on high margins in well-positioned communities will continue to be the primary engine that drives SG&A operating leverage that will continue to produce strong and sustainable bottom line earnings. Lennar's Homebuilding operations are operating soundly and are defined by excellent hands-on management running the day-to-day activities, while excellent new communities are identified and added to each division.","Lennar Financial Services had another excellent quarter as well, leveraging the core Homebuilding business, providing excellent service to our customers and adding incremental volume by participating in the refinance market as well. In the second quarter, Rialto continued to be a central part of the improving Lennar story. While current earnings of $4.3 million fell short of our expectations, the contribution that our Rialto connections and relationships have made to our core Homebuilding business has exceeded every expectation we had when we began to grow this business. In this regard, I have to highlight the credible work of Eric Feder, who has been the bridge between Rialto and Lennar managers and has maximized the synergy. The Rialto franchise will continue to be a significant source of valuable homebuilding deals for some time to come, while the base Rialto business ramps its earnings. As we look ahead, Rialto should continue to be a solid earnings contributor for Lennar and will begin to return cash to corporate as it is now investing self-generated funds.","I would be remiss if I did not briefly address the recent press coverage on a financing deal with a Chinese bank on our Hunters Point and Treasure Island partnerships. While we do not comment on deals that are in negotiation or not closed, I will say that we have a great number of very exciting dealings around various strategic assets that will reveal themselves over time. Of course, we will make material announcements as appropriate.","All in all, our second quarter 2012 results mark an excellent stepping stone to our future performance. We're feeling more and more comfortable that the current trend is not an aberration but the beginning of a new cycle for housing. This sense derives from extensive feedback from our people in the field and from the nature of the shift in the consumers' mindset. As I look ahead to the remainder of this year and towards 2013, I am increasingly optimistic that we are seeing a real bottom in housing and that we will continue to see signs of recovery. National statistics and news will give us some mixed signals as we move through the year as they represent a compendium of all of the best and the worst markets around the country. But I feel that stabilization and recovery will emanate from the most desirable markets and spread outward over time.","Lennar is positioned with a strong balance sheet, is in the right markets with an exceptional management team and a well-constructed strategy to perform solidly as market conditions continue to improve. All of the segments of our company are performing well and are extremely well positioned, as you will now hear from our operating team. Rick?","Richard Beckwitt","Thanks, Stuart. We are really pleased with our operating results this quarter. These results were driven by both the well-executed land acquisition strategy and a fine-tuned homebuilding machine. I'm going to review our land activities and explain why Lennar is positioned to succeed in today's land market. Jon is then going to discuss our building activities and how we maximize our gross and operating margins.","During the first quarter, we continued to focus on acquiring or auctioning new homesites that would have a positive impact on our bottom line. This quarter, we purchased 4,561 homesites for $206 million, and we spent $81 million on land development. Combined, our land acquisition and land development spend was up about 74% over the prior-year period.","In addition, we signed option contracts to acquire 1,597 homesites. From a geographic standpoint, approximately 29% of our land purchases in the second quarter are located in the mid-Atlantic, 23% in the West, 22% in Texas, 14% in Florida, 7% in the Pacific Northwest, with the remaining 5% spread throughout our other markets. The lion's share of our new land deals were sourced outside of a competitive bid environment and were relationship-based deals. As in prior quarters, money was invested geographically in the markets where we saw the best opportunities.","In Q2, we continue to acquire great deals in Florida and Texas but invested more heavily in some extremely high-margin opportunities in California and the mid-Atlantic. You will continue to see quarter-to-quarter changes in the geographic mix of our land purchases as we capitalize on the best opportunities out there.","While the land market has heated up recently, our pipeline of land that we're actively negotiating is robust. More importantly, over the last several quarters, we put under contract or letter of intent over 24,000 homesites that have yet to close. And you should note that since these homesites are still in the diligence process, that they are not included in our homesite owned or controlled total that I will give you later. Consistent with our prior land purchases, these land deals have been underwritten to exceed a 20% gross margin and a 20% IRR with no inflation.","To date, we've been extremely pleased with the performance of our new communities. During the second quarter, approximately 48% of our deliveries came from communities purchased or put under contract during the last 3 years. Our gross margins on closings in these communities was approximately 200 basis points higher than the gross margin for the entire company in the second quarter. By this point, it should be clear that we've invested wisely. The numbers truly speak for themselves. And as the housing markets recover, we believe we will continue to outperform the industry given our expertise in land acquisition.","Let me explain why we will continue to be successful and how we are different from our competition. Number one is sourcing. We are fishing in a different pond. We have created many deep-rooted relationships with banks and other local sellers that provide us access to deals that are not on the open market.","Number two is speed. We move quickly to assess, analyze and respond to new opportunities. We digest information quickly, and we have a streamlined approach to tying up a deal. We respond immediately to contract issues and can get a deal signed faster than anyone else. We are business people and don't let our lawyers control the deal.","Expertise. Our key land associates have the knowledge and ability to negotiate complex deals. We do not shy away from complicated deal structures. We have the financial strength of a large company but the agility and expertise of sophisticated private investors. We are not a big bureaucratic organization where the deal needs to fit within a box.","Fourth is credibility. Our due diligence process is systematic, thorough and effective. We commit to understanding the issues while we're pursuing the deal. Thus, when we sign a contract, we very rarely have to renegotiate because we took time to understand the facts and nuances of the deal upfront. This no re-trade credibility has given us the reputation of a company that gets deals done. In turn, we have become a preferred buyer.","Fifth is persistence. When we identify a deal, we will pursue it until there's absolutely no chance that we will not get it. We do not accept the first \"no\" as an answer, and we will relentlessly pursue the deal, constantly reviewing whether there is an alternative deal structure that can turn the \"no\" into a \"maybe\" and ultimately a \"yes.\"","Sixth is performance. Our consistent operating performance gives us the ability to engage sellers at a different level. Our execution in opening communities and driving traffic, as well as our product selection and EI platform, differentiates us from other builders. This tends to give us a first look at deals and often makes us a perfect builder in a multi-builder community.","And seventh is Rialto. We buy more than just land. We have the expertise to buy assets that will turn into land such as CDD bonds and bank notes and mortgages. This provides us a constant stream of high-margin opportunities. No other homebuilder has this depth of experience.","Let me give you a few examples of how these factors have positioned us to succeed. Recently, another public builder signed a deal with a local developer for the first phase of homesites in a very large multi-phase community. Through our Rialto connection, we learned that a bank owned other homesites in the community, and we approached the developer to jointly purchase these homesites. As partners in a very small piece of the community and with 24\/7 access to the developer, we built a close relationship with the developer and secured a key opportunity in the balance of this multiphase deal. The critical elements here were the Rialto connection, the relentless pursuit and creative approach to finding a way into a deal that someone else controlled, the relationship we built with the developer and the strong performance of the initial partnership.","In another transaction, an out-of-state bank foreclosed on the last section of a very desirable community. They approached several buyers with a very complicated deal terms and a short diligence period. Many builders balked at the deal due to its complexity, while others, according to the bank, wasted a great deal of the bank's time trying to understand the issues. Our team was successful not because we paid top dollar, because we didn't. We got the deal done because we had the financial acumen and intellectual capacity to get it done quickly. As a result, we have positioned Lennar as the go-to company for deals in that market.","My last example has to do with CDD bonds. On previous conference calls, I've described that we've actively pursued bond purchases as a way to back into underlying real estate. Because of the relationships we've developed over the last 2 years with the holders of the bonds, we're often contacted by them when they want to sell their positions. These positions tend to trade very quickly, and the purchase requires a unique knowledge of bonds, foreclosures and entitlements. We have this expertise in Rialto and in our Homebuilding divisions, so we can immediately react to these first-look opportunities.","Before I turn it over to Jon, let me give you some final stats. On a year-over-year basis, our Q2 inventory increased about $557 million to approximately $4.4 billion. And this excludes consolidated inventory not owned. Sequentially, our inventory during Q2 increased about $145 million from Q1. At May 31, 2012, we owned and controlled 121,517 homesites and had 440 active communities. I'd like to turn it over to Jon.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Thank you, Rick, and good morning. As Stuart noted, we're very pleased with our second quarter results of a post impairment 22.5% gross margins and 9.2% operating margin. I will speak to how we continue to drive bottom line profitability through our management of pricing, product, direct costs and operating structure leverage.","Our operational focus of balancing sales, price and pace starts by, first, stabilizing pricing, community by community. Then we focus on increasing the pace of sales, creating positive momentum. It is this momentum that enabled us to lower incentives and\/or raise prices this quarter. This resulted in new orders of 4,481, improvement of 40% year-over-year and 48% sequentially over Q1. For the prior 4 quarters, sales were stabilized at 2.4 sales per community per month. This quarter, we increased our sales pace to 3.5 sales per month. Incentives were down to 10.7%, a year-over-year 140-basis-point improvement. This was primarily due to the improved rate of sales and a higher percentage of the homes sold prior to starting construction.","Our backlog grew to 3,970 homes, up 61% year-over-year and 46% sequentially. With this rapid increase in our backlog, sold homes now represent 48% of total homes under construction. That, combined with a material increase in the number of pre-sold homes, we expect that our backlog conversion ratio will dip below 100% in Q3.","Our newer communities with higher gross margins and absorption continue to capture a greater share of our deliveries and sales. However, one of the keys for our margin and absorption success this quarter was our focus on communities where the rate of sales was below the company average. We have a process in place where our divisions review detailed plans with senior management on strategies and tactics to improve the performance of these communities.","Our product strategy continues to focus on the execution of our Everything's Included platform. Having the right product with a simplified home purchase process gives us a competitive edge, especially against resales and rentals. Our Everything's Included research has led us introduce a new product line this year, Lennar's Next Gen, The Home Within a Home. We introduced this product in the West and are now rolling it out across the country. We expect to be offering Next Gen plans in about 25% of our community by year-end. This home appealed to many buyer segments but predominantly the baby boomer who needs to take care of aging parents or boomerang kids. This product is without competition from resales and is producing strong gross margins and incremental sales for Lennar.","This quarter, we continued to see urgency in customers making the buying decision, and raising prices helped create this urgency. Sales were very consistent throughout the quarter as only about 100 sales separated our biggest month from the smallest. We are seeing continued strength into June.","On the mortgage front, we continue to face the challenging underwriting environment. Offsetting this is our consistent and close working relationship with UAMC. We see this benefit in our prequalification process, which led to our low 16% cancellation rate.","Turning to the cost side of the equation. While there are some cost pressures materializing, we continue to believe that these increases will be offset by sales price improvements and our continued focus on managing direct costs. For 6 quarters running, our average direct costs remain in the range of $40 to $42 per square foot.","As I have discussed on prior calls, we have an intense focus on lowering our cost while improving our quality. Our focus on Everything's Included not only delivers great value for the homebuyer but allows us to simplify everything from how we order materials to the flow on job sites. EI makes it easier to unbundle, giving us more transparency into our cost. It allows us to reduce SKUs, so our supplier have less to stock. And in those structural options, value engineering is enhanced because we do not have the need for multiple engineering solutions on each home. All of this helps skilled labor, too, as there are fewer change orders and greater consistency in field installation.","We also continued our intense focus on managing extras in cost variances, working to eliminate these costs from the system. With our increased volume, we continued to leverage our operating structure. With deliveries up 20% year-over-year, our SG&A dropped to 13.2%, a 170-basis-point improvement. Once again, our approach is simplifying the homebuilding process centered around Everything's Included, enhances the overall leverage we're able to achieve. We continued to be extremely disciplined in controlling our indirect costs. We have in place a strong management team organized in a simple regional and divisional structure that allows for delivery growth with minimal additions to this structure.","Across our divisions, we are actively and intensely managing each of the components that make up our net operating margin. I want to add my thanks to all of our associates for their hard work and focus in achieving our second quarter results.","Thank you, and I'd now like to turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Rialto now has a focused team of over 200 professionals acquiring, resolving and adding value to distressed and advantageously priced real estate assets. We continue on the path to build a first-class investment and asset management company, which over the long haul, we expect will generate significant shareholder value.","This quarter's earnings of $4.3 million for the Rialto segment are still not where we'd like to see them. This is mainly due to the timing of recoveries and higher expenses resulting from a number of borrowers and guarantors in our earlier distressed debt portfolios, taking obstinate positions about repaying their loans and bucking historical norms. More recently, we have seen this turn into an increased effort by a number of investor and developer obligors to alter existing laws to frustrate the original contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements, specifically to limit our ability to collect what is due. While we continue to be successful with our approach, including the use of the judicial process when necessary, the related higher costs must be expensed upfront, while revenue recognition is being delayed until later in the process.","Nonetheless, operationally and from a cash flow perspective, we've made substantial progress on these portfolios, collecting over $650 million to date. And we've already repositioned almost $2 billion of loans into owned real estate. Of the original $627 million of FDIC seller financing, net of all cash on hand, it's now effectively down to approximately $240 million.","All of our distressed debt investments since early 2011 have been made through our fund business where we had already recalibrated our thinking about the timing and cost of resolution. And we continue to materially exceed our original expectations on timing and amount of cash resolution.","Our first $700 million real estate private equity vehicle, as well as our PPIP fund with AllianceBernstein, had another strong quarter contributing $12.2 million from our share of underlying earnings, plus fees and reimbursements. In addition, we have already started monetizing our investment in PPIP, selling almost $2 billion of face amount of securities since the last time we reported to you and repatriating over $22 million to the company of our $70 million investment.","Our real estate fund has been able to acquire and tie up almost 40 different transactions, and their pipeline of new investments continues to be strong. We've already invested the lion's share of our funds' original equity commitments to acquire about $1.8 billion of assets, based on unpaid principal balance, for less than $0.40 on the dollar. And through the end of the quarter, the fund has already collected over $225 million from interest, principal and asset resolutions at levels significantly higher and sooner than originally anticipated, as well as from a groundbreaking nonperforming loan securitization, which has received a great deal of industry attention.","Our fund and future investment vehicles should not only help to enhance the company's returns and add consistent cash flow and earnings but also will be important building blocks for us to create a strong investment management business. Along those lines, we're already earning fees from a number of sources, including the oversight of the fund in PPIP and from our loan workout and asset management activities. We also earn carried interest when we exceed targeted returns.","In addition, last week, we received over first rating as a CMBS special servicer. We have already established Rialto as a leader in today's mortgage-backed securities marketplace. And for those of you remember what we did with LNR, we expect these activities to open up new opportunities for us to add further to our existing book of business.","Perhaps the most significant and unexpected contribution that Rialto has added to the Lennar enterprise, though, is the invaluable access to borrowers and lenders that has contributed to the pipeline of deal flow that is driving our primary homebuilding business. As Rick and Stuart have indicated, direct access to distressed sellers has helped us source many advantageously priced land positions for the homebuilder. Together, we have worked to add over 10,000 new homesites across dozens of new Lennar communities in multiple markets and with a lot more in the pipeline.","These are a few of the reasons why we remain excited about the continued progress of our Rialto franchise. Our ability to add new sources of solid business on our already existing management base, our current position in the marketplace and the synergies with the rest of the Lennar operations, we expect, in due course, will be reflected in growing value for our shareholders. Thank you. And David?","David M. Collins","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Stuart mentioned, we reversed $403 million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2012. We came to this conclusion because the company determined that it was more likely than not that the majority of its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets would be utilized. The reversal of $403 million of our valuation allowance is presented as a benefit from income taxes in our income statement. The conclusion to reverse this amount was based on a detailed evaluation of all relevant evidence, both positive and negative, including such factors as our nonconsecutive quarters of earnings, the expectation of continued profitability, as well as the housing recovery we are experiencing in our markets.","I will take a few minutes to explain the process we undertook to reach our conclusion. Historically each quarter, we have evaluated the relevant evidence regarding the DTA. Our analysis each quarter included a review of the overall housing market conditions, local market conditions and the company's actual results and financial projections. As of May 31, we concluded that there was sufficient, objectively, verifiable, positive evidence that outweighed the negative evidence and deemed that it was more likely than not that we would utilize our DTA in future periods. And as such, we reversed $403 million of the allowance.","Among the factors we considered in our analysis were the following. We have had 9 consecutive quarters of profits with an expectation of continued profits. We were profitable across all of our businesses. Our operating leverage has improved significantly. Our year-to-date deliveries increased 24% year-over-year. Our year-to-date new orders increased 37% year-over-year. Our backlog increased 61% year-over-year. Housing starts have increased, and new home inventory is at an all-time low. We project to use our NOLs in the carryforward period, and we've had no history of NOLs expiring unused.","The process that we undertook to reach our reversal conclusion was extensive and was reviewed by our independent external auditors, Deloitte & Touche. The reversal of $403 million of the DTA valuation allowance leaves a $177 million valuation allowance remaining at May 31.","There are 2 components that make up the remaining valuation allowance of $177 million which, if the housing recovery continues, we expect most of the remaining allowance to reverse between Q3 2012 and Q4 2013.","The first component. The accounting rules require a valuation allowance as being reversed in an interim period, such as our second quarter, to be partly applied to the remaining periods in the year. Therefore, we expect to reverse portions of the $177 million valuation allowance in Q3 and Q4 of 2012. These amounts should offset the tax expense we would have recorded in Q3 and Q4. Thus, we expect our net tax expense for the remainder of the year to be close to 0.","The second component. We will also continue to provide a valuation allowance on a portion of our DTA relating to state NOLs. The reason for this is that the state tax laws for the most part do not allow for us to carry back NOLs. It's different for Federal tax purposes where we're able to carryback most of our Federal NOLs. We will evaluate the remaining amount relating to such state items each quarter. And if the housing recovery continues it is likely that most of the remaining allowance relating to our state NOLs will reverse between now and the end of fiscal 2013.","With the reversal of most of our DTA valuation allowance, our stockholders' equity is now over $3 billion. Our net homebuilding debt to total capital improved to 46.9%, and our book value per share is up to $16.79. From an accounting standpoint, this is a significant milestone for our company.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Bruce.","Bruce E. Gross","Thanks, David, and good morning. I'll provide a little more color to the results, starting with Homebuilding. Revenues from home sales increased 23% to $796 million, driven by a 20% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 2% increase in average sales price to $250,000.","The breakdown by region is as follows. The East region had an average sale price of $231,000, up 4%; Southeast Florida, $266,000, up 1%; Central Florida, $229,000, up 9%; Houston, $229,000, down 1%; the West region, $304,000, down 1%; and the other category, $321,000, down 17% due to product mix.","Jon already highlighted the drivers of our strong gross margin performance and significant operating leverage during the quarter. The gross margins were strong in all of our regions this quarter, but they were strongest in the East and Southeast Florida regions. During the quarter, we had asset sales that were recognized in both the equity and earnings from unconsolidated subsidiary and other income lines. Although the joint venture asset sales resulted in a loss, the asset sales on the other income line had a profit. And combined, these 2 line items totaled $3.4 million of income in Q2, and that compares to $11.9 million in the prior year.","Our Financial Services business segment generated operating earnings of $18 million versus $2.5 million last year. These are the strongest quarterly operating earnings for Financial Services since 2006. Mortgage pretax income increased to $17.2 million from $5.3 million in the prior year. This quarter's mortgage originations increased by 50% to $976 million. Our in-house mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 77% this quarter. Originations with non-Lennar homebuyers increased 89% this quarter primarily due to an increase in the number of refinanced transactions as interest rates were under 4% for the quarter.","Our title company had a $1.4 million profit in the quarter. And that compares with a loss of $2.2 million in the prior year as the volume of transactions increased by 39% this quarter.","Our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings of $4.3 million. This number is net of $3.2 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, and that compares to $9.8 million in the prior year. The composition of Rialto's $4.3 million of operating earnings by type of investment is as follows. The FDIC portfolios had a $3.2 million gain; non-FDIC portfolios had a $1.3 million gain; PPIP contributed $2.7 million; and the Rialto Real Estate Fund contributed $3 million of earnings. And that was all less by $5.9 million of G&A and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $6.6 million.","Our balance sheet liquidity improved in the second quarter with the completion of a $525 million 3-year unsecured revolving credit facility, of which $410 million was initially committed. As a result, our liquidity increased to $1.1 billion when adding our cash balance to the fully undrawn revolver.","As David mentioned, our stockholders' equity increased significantly this quarter, which reduced our homebuilding net debt to total capital by 270 basis points. And our book value per share increased 17%, again, to $16.79.","While it has not been customary for us to provide earnings guidance, I wanted to highlight a couple of items for the remainder of 2012. Our backlog conversion ratio, which has been running above 110% for the past few years, now with the large percentage of presales that Jon discussed and given the cycle time on these deliveries, a number of these homes will not close in the third quarter but rather in the fourth quarter. As a result, the backlog conversion ratio we expect for Q3 deliveries is between 85% and 90%. Additionally, we expect our gross margin percentage to range between 21% and 22.5% for the remainder of the year.","With that, let's open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Kim of Barclays.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to talk to you a little bit about your ability to raise prices as tempered by the appraisal process. We've been hearing ongoing concerns about appraisals, and yet, it does seem that just as buyers are able to get their financials in order in a better way than they were a year ago, builders are also finding ways to deal with a difficult appraisal process. I was wondering if you could share with us what you're seeing in the marketplace. Are you seeing any positive trends there? And what do you think it will take for the appraisals to take a significant step back in being a headwind for you?","Stuart A. Miller","Steve, we've discussed this topic, certainly, at our presidents' meeting. And look, here's the good news. The good news is that the appraisal process, appraisals in general, have really gotten in line with the market. And the pendulum has kind of swung closer to normal than it was 6 months ago. Six months ago, appraisals just at market prices were really driving prices lower. And I don't -- we don't get the sense that, that's as much the case out in the field today. Now with prices starting to move up, there's clearly some stickiness, and there's going to be a process of kind of finding equilibrium and the appraisers getting a sense. They'll probably lag the market and be a little bit more conservative in their approach, and we're hearing instances of this. But over time, we think it's going to find its way to a realistic setting. And I think on average, I'd say I feel pretty optimistic about the appraisal side of things, finding equilibrium maybe a little bit ahead of the mortgage side.","Richard Beckwitt","Yes. One thing I'd add to that, Steve, is that procedurally in the field, we raise it in small increments so it's easier to get the appraisal to get there. So it's tough to goose things by $5,000 or $10,000 in a month period. So you break it up into $1,000 to $2,500 increments. And we haven't seen a lot of resistance to that in the field.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, nor have I. And that's a great change of pace from where we were a year ago. Second question is, again, sort of a general question with respect to the issue of expectations. You all were fairly early in identifying a turn in the housing market at least in your communities. And we've seen increasingly people getting on board with that and echoing that. I was curious, though, if there were any pockets of the industry where you felt that expectations are perhaps getting a little ahead of where the market really is right now and where you think it is reasonable to expect it to be in the next 2 -- let's say, 1 to 2 quarters. So areas where people, you sense, may be being overly optimistic at this point maybe after having been a little bit slow to make that initial move, whether it be in the land side, in other areas of dealmaking, the mortgage side or anything that you're seeing in the marketplace.","Stuart A. Miller","Well, look, you highlight that we might have been a little bit earlier in reporting. I think that we're just, as a management group, very, very tightly connected with the field on a regular basis. And we're really just reporting very candidly the things that we're seeing, hearing and feeling as trends from the field. I think that it feels to us that right now, as I've said, it feels very much like we've hit a bottom and we're starting to come off of that bottom. I'm a little nervous about saying the word recovery. We'll see how things evolve over the next couple of quarters. And it will be easy for people to get a little bit ahead of the market. I don't think that there's reason for exuberance right now except for the fact that the beatings have stopped. But I think that we do have headwinds in the market, whether it's mortgage approvals, whether it's kind of remnant limitations from appraisals and prices moving up. I think that it would be easy for people to kind of get ahead of themselves in terms of the high point of home prices and where they can go quickly. I think that we're in for a steady recovery as one takes hold that is going to be slower than the V shape that people are used to. But at the same time, given the limitations on land, access to land and land availability, we are going to see, as the recovery does start to take hold, a move up in prices. So it's hard to say where people are getting ahead of themselves. I think it's a little bit too fresh. But I think that as in all recoveries, we are prone, as a group, to get a little ahead of ourselves. We're trying to keep things in check and stay very closely tied to the field.","Operator","Our next question is from Joshua Pollard of Goldman Sachs.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first question was actually for Jon. Can you walk through the progression of incentives per home, by month, over the course of the quarter and talk about where those incentive levels are in your backlog, ultimately trying to understand even if you guys can't push prices because of appraisal issues, how much further you guys have to cut on the incentive structure.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Josh, first, we don't break out our incentives and backlog to that level of detail. What we are seeing in the field is, I mean, this recovery is very localized. The downturn was very national, but as conditions improve in the field, it improves at different levels in different markets. So in some markets, we've been able to both reduce incentives fairly aggressively and even raise prices. In other markets, it's relatively flat and stabilized. But we are seeing that trend come down. Where a year ago we were about 12.5%. A year ago, we were at 12.5% in average sales price and incentives, and now we're down to 10.7%. We're seeing that steady decline, and I'd say that -- and it varies by area, but in the West, we'll probably see about 85% of our communities are able to achieve price or incentive improvement. And the Central is a little bit better than that, and on the East Coast, it's a little bit behind that.","Operator","The next question comes from David Goldberg of UBS.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question, Stuart, you talked about in the opening comments your feeling that there was someone in the government that kind of understood the issues around mortgage underwriting. And I'm wondering if you could just give us an idea of the political landscape in your mind now between the forces that are kind of pushing for tighter underwriting, especially for FHA\/VA loans and the forces that say we need to kind of find a way to stimulate housing more through -- at a minimum kind of -- at a minimum don't tighten any more but maybe even loosen a little bit and kind of how your thoughts on how that's playing out, especially as it relates to the QM standard and underwriting as we go forward.","Stuart A. Miller","Okay. David, I'm not going to name names, but I will say that certainly within the government there has been over the past year a recognition and awareness that housing, really, is a central issue and key to a recovery within the economy. And I think you see that really on both sides of the aisle. It doesn't mean that there aren't some people that feel that more and more tightening is required, and you hear some of those sentiments come out. But the more people have come to understand that housing is a very important key to driving employment and driving psychology improvements or sentiment improvements among the consumer, who, by and large, own homes, the feeling among many legislators is that the pendulum has swung too far and that the mortgage process has become overly cumbersome and been driven past the point of being safe and secure. And there is beginning to be some pushback. I think that if you were to speak to the people within Fannie, Freddie, FHA\/VA, there's kind of a balancing point, let's say, that kind of goes like, \"Hey, let's keep things conservative enough. Let's not get back to 0-down mortgages. Let's have a healthy downpayment. But let's also recognize that we've probably made the paperwork overly cumbersome.\" The credit scores were probably that requiring too high of a credit score for what's reasonable. And in order to get banks lending again, I think that there's a sentiment that we have to ease up a little bit. The last thing I want to say is, as I remember, last week it was that I saw an article that noted that the FHFA is starting to reconsider the putback requirements relative to some of the banks as it relates to Fannie and Freddie loans. And that is a really good indicator that political currents are kind of moving in the direction of saying, \"Hey, if we can resolve or create safe harbors relative to putback risk, then we're going to define the landscape for banks and enable them to make a more comfortable lending decision as they go forward.\" And I think that's as good of an indicator as I can point to that the political world is really starting to get an understanding that we've probably swung too far to the conservative side.","David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up. I think you guys did a great job on outlining what differentiates Lennar on the land front, the land acquisition front. And I was wondering if we could follow up and just think about the peer group that's also trying to pursue the same land opportunities. And if we kind of put Rialto to the side because clearly, that's a competitive advantage and very, very hard to replicate, I'm wondering about the other factors that you guys listed. How replicable are they and how much do you think you're going to see competitors trying to become, as an example, more nimble in the way that they're underwriting land to try to compete better with the likes of Lennar in the land market now? In other words, how high are the barriers to entry right now? How long will it take your competitors to try to do some of these things more efficiently?","Richard Beckwitt","Well, let's just be clear that it is a very competitive land environment. And as you highlight Rialto as a distinguishing factor, keep in mind that Rialto has taught a lot of our homebuilding divisions out here how to do these things in local markets. So it's really Rialto almost on steroids right now in the markets across the country. The things you need to think about is the DNA in Lennar has always been land oriented. And we look at things in a different way than many of the other builders. We're not averse to developing our own land or working with landowners to work on entitlements. And as a result, we don't have a need to just go in there and buy finished homesites because that's what our metrics are with regard to how we operate. So from a process standpoint, we are very nimble. We're fast. We don't have an enormous book-building process to get things reviewed at a local then a regional then a corporate level that takes 3 or 4 weeks or sometimes months. We can make those decisions relatively quickly. And with all of that in mind, I think that speed is a huge differentiator, as well as the ability to do things that are extraordinarily complex.","Stuart A. Miller","Let me add to that. There are 2 components of land acquisition. Number one is finding the things to negotiate on, and number two is the way that you go about negotiating. I think it's very hard to just hire someone and to replicate. I think that what you've seen in our management team, whether it's Jon and Rick on the Homebuilding side, whether it's Jeff and Jay Mantz on the Rialto side, or Eric Feder as the bridge, so much of what we're able to identify is being driven by relationships, relationships that have been put in place over these past couple of years through the toughest of times. And there's a certain thickness to those relationships that is sticky and is really positioning us well. But a lot of what Rick highlighted as well is beyond just access to the deals. It's the way that our group has reacted to those deals that augments the relationship and basically feeds back to it. It's the speed at which we operate. It's the completeness with which we deal with people. It's the integrity that we bring to the table and the decision to do the homework in advance and not end up retrading and walking away from a whole bunch of deals that is really holding us in good stead as people look for certainty of close. So my personal view is that it's not easily replicatable [ph], and we're in an awfully good position right now.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question on Rialto. I know it's been -- obviously, it's a segment that will not necessarily go in a straight line, but you did mention you're not necessarily where you want to be in terms of the earnings out of there. And I was just wondering if you can kind of walk through maybe where you're -- kind of reiterate -- maybe get a little bit more granular in terms of the different buckets that you break out, where you're maybe having the most challenges, what you might be doing if there's anything to do differently over the next couple of quarters to maybe get that back on track ultimately to where you think it should be at this point.","Stuart A. Miller","Yes. I think the way that I look at it, Mike, is, first of all, as we kind of segregate out or think through the component parts of Rialto, PPIP is performing very well. Our private equity or private investment fund is performing extremely well. The area where we probably had the most kind of letdown is in some of our earlier portfolios where I think Jeff highlighted well the fact that because -- really what you're seeing is moral hazard at work. What we're seeing -- and we have a long history of dealing with borrowers and distressed debt. What we've been seeing is that the borrowers have taken a more adamant, obstinate position in dealing with the workout team and have almost just blocked the doors without any legal basis in coming or not coming to the resolution table. In many instances, they've been hiding behind pending legislation from either friends or legislative friends who they've engaged to try to get legislation to bail them out of what might be a bad contractual relationship or a bad personal guarantee. And so the resolution process has been somewhat frustrated and stymied by a longer resolution period and some additional legal cost in getting to where we had expected to be in our initial diligence. So timing is proving to be somewhat elusive. At the end of the day, what we're finding is that the legislative attempts and the attempts of borrowers to subvert their notes and personal obligations is ultimately falling by the wayside. And over time, we think that we're going to end up in the place that we thought we would end up, but those initial deals are not performing timing-wise the way that we had hoped that they would.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just to take Rialto from the other side, because I believe you did mention that it is contributing to the core homebuilding operations in a competitive -- almost as a competitive -- as a competitive advantage, very much beneficial to the gross margin levels. So on the flipside, I was hoping perhaps over the -- this past quarter, the last couple of quarters, if you could give any insight in terms of, I think you've done this before, what proportion of the land deals that you've entered into recently are through those more, through the Rialto relationships where you have a less competitive or noncompetitive bidding process. And when you look at the gross margin expansion that you've had, it would appear that most of it is just from less -- lower incentive levels, but any insight around the contribution to the gross margins would also be helpful in understanding the other elements of Rialto.","Stuart A. Miller","Well, look, I think that as I've noted, we've had some mild disappointments on timing relative to some of our earlier deals. But Rialto has been a grand slam home run for this company in terms of what it has done, in terms of positioning us to be able to grow and enhance our primary Homebuilding business, not just from the standpoint of access to deals because frankly, that's gone both ways. The relationships on the Lennar side have sometimes found new business for Rialto and sometimes very much in the opposite direction. But the knowledge base that our Rialto team has enhanced our homebuilding operations with in terms of the breadth of kinds of deals that we can undertake to purchase in order to get to land, whether it's CDD bonds, as Rick points out, or purchasing notes on assets or just having relationships with borrowers or people in the real estate business, we have leveraged the Rialto franchise as a very, very strong driver of Lennar business. Now this disentangling and getting to percentages of deals that derive from the Rialto side, the Lennar side and what percentage has the Rialto relationship actually played, we just can't break it out that way because it's kind of too organic. It's intertwined. And I've highlighted the work of Eric, Eric Feder, as the bridge between the 2 operating divisions. I mean, we have a very smooth and compatible relationship between both sides that's kind of amplifying the performance on both sides. As it relates to the performance of Rialto going forward, we have absolutely put together a blue-chip team of loan workout professionals that will be a platform for our business going forward, but we will recalibrate and get those operations working more in line with the way we expected in the beginning.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Can I squeeze one more in? It looked like community count, given your sales pace community count was down roughly 5% year-over-year, can you give us a guidance of where you might end up for the year end or what you think about 2013?","Stuart A. Miller","Community count?","Richard Beckwitt","I think as we said in prior calls, from the beginning of the year we thought we'd be up about 5% to 10% from the community count we started in the year.","Stuart A. Miller","On a net basis.","Operator","Our next question is from Alan Ratner of Zelman & Associates.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","I was hoping to ask about your gross margin guidance. I believe the high end of your range, 22.5%, is equal to what you guys reported this quarter. And obviously, this quarter's results were much stronger than your prior guidance range. And it seems -- based on your commentary, I know you're having some success raising prices or reducing incentives. And from Jon's comments, you've been pretty successful in mitigating the cost inflation you're seeing on the materials side. So just curious why you wouldn't make, maybe, a range a little bit higher than where you're currently at today and whether there's any other issues I'm missing here, either mix or something along those lines, that would offset some of those price increases.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","This is Jon. As I said in my comments, we do feel that we've got cost control measures in place that will help offset what's happening in the field with pressure on labor and materials. We are very focused on incentives and sales prices. But as you look forward, those factors are going to -- those pressures in the field starts -- increase will continue to ramp up. And very hard to predict what the mix is, how that will affect what that gross margin is. And as we look to the different mix of deliveries from the markets changing in the 4 quarters, we feel pretty comfortable with the range that we gave.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Okay. Appreciate that. And then on the corporate line, it looks think there's a little bit of a sequential increase there to about $29 million, and that's a bit higher than you had been running at. Just curious if that's a function of the new markets you're entering or whether there were some one-timers in there and where can we think about a run rate going forward?","Bruce E. Gross","Sure. Alan, this is Bruce. As you look at last year, the number was below normal. I think we're averaging close to $24 million a quarter last year. This year is $29 million. It's primarily due to stock-based compensation expense, as the stock has gone up. And some of the variable compensation expense also added to the G&A this quarter.","Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","So that's something you expect to be recurring going forward or dependent somewhat on the performance?","Bruce E. Gross","We haven't given exact guidance, but I would expect as our profits go up, variable compensation expense will as well. And as the stock prices increase, the stock compensation expense will also. So I would expect that it's likely to be higher than what you've seen in the past year for those reasons.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen East of ISI Group.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Stuart, if we could go back to demand just for a minute. As we walk [ph] communities [indiscernible], will we see where it looks like a lot of the new home sales are being helped quite a bit by lack of competing inventory. And I'm just wondering, from your standpoint, whether you think that's true or not. And then also, if that is true, are you starting to see it slide into, call it, the B-, C+ locations or any particular segment demand out there?","Stuart A. Miller","Let me give that over to Rick and Jon. They're a little bit closer to it.","Richard Beckwitt","As far as the B, B-, I think with the improving market, all communities are starting to perform a little bit better. But clearly, the better-located A locations are capturing the lion's share of the activity. We're seeing increased demand out there. A lot of it has to do with the lack of availability of competing product, and that's given us the ability to raise prices and decrease incentives. And as Jon said earlier, our sales pace per community pretty much across the company has improved regionally and by each market.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Steve, this is Jon. I think as you're aware, Phoenix is a good example of the answer to your question where MLS listings dropped pretty dramatically. That, in turn, helped the pace of sales and pricing for the new home product. But as you get to the B- and C locations around Phoenix, those are not doing as well. So if you're down on Buckeye or Goodyear, they're not doing as well as Chandler and Scottsdale and the closer-in markets. I think we can pretty much see that kind of scenario playing out across the country and in the various markets.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then if we look at -- you gave breakout of land spend, et cetera, and talked about community growth. Are you demothballing the communities to any degree? And you've got a new revolver in place, so at what level are you comfortable with your cash balance? So in other words, how do you look at land spend, et cetera, moving forward?","Stuart A. Miller","It's interesting that in our division presidents' meeting we went through each of our divisions. Each division president gives the presentation, and we're very carefully monitoring the progress of mothballed communities. And the answer is, yes, there are some that are starting to come online. And we actually have some pretty good examples of some that are really starting to contribute to our gross margin and bottom line.","Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then one last quick question, are you seeing any shortages of labor in any of your markets or anything along those lines that are pushing out your delivery date?","Stuart A. Miller","Just a little bit, and it involves the trades either [ph]. But certainly, as is typical in market recoveries, sales go first, then starts, and then labor has to catch up to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","This is Desi filling in for Bob. So regarding gross margins, you guys discussed sales incentives as a percentage of revenues were lower for the quarter. The lowering of incentives -- is that something you're seeing competitors do as well in the markets that you operate?","Richard Beckwitt","Yes, the competition, they're doing all sorts of things. I think everybody in the industry is trying to raise prices and trying to reduce incentives. And the success of our peers out there, I think you'll have to ask them with regard to what they're doing and how effective they are.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then for Financial Services, obviously, there was a big jump there in operating income. And then in terms of the operating leverage in that segment, with the increase in spend, new orders and deliveries, is that something you would expect going forward how the operating income could increase that greatly.","Bruce E. Gross","Well, the operating leverage is there in Financial Services, just like we're seeing with Homebuilding. I think the one thing to note is that there was a significant increase in volume, a lot of that attributable to refinance activity. So the refinance activity will be certainly lumpy depending on what happens with interest rates.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jade Rahmani of KBW.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","In looking at your operating margins, I wanted to find out how your incremental margin performance compared with the 16% guidance you gave last quarter. We estimated roughly 30% because you had gross margin expansion, as well as the SG&A leverage. Is that accurate? And what do you think is achievable going forward in terms of incremental margins?","Bruce E. Gross","So again, just to go back to last quarter, what we said is in an existing community, when we go from 2 sales a month to 3 sales a month per community, the incremental operating margin is about 16%. And that was assuming the 21% gross margin and then the incremental SG&A expense of about 4.5% or so. So that type of incremental leverage was a little bit higher this quarter as the gross margin was a little higher than the 21%. So we still believe the incremental operating leverage in existing communities to be at about that level or possibly a little bit higher. In new communities, it's a little bit less because the SG&A expense is a little higher. You have to hire sales and construction people, bring on new models. And there, we typically say that the SG&A incrementally is 7% or 8%, so your incremental operating margin will be a little bit less. So we do expect that incremental operating leverage to continue.","Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So margins, as your volume increases, margins should still expand. Secondly, just on the backlog conversion guidance, the lower spec -- is the lower spec mix a function of the market or a change in your strategy? And then secondly, are you intentionally constraining delivery pace in order to both manage your margins, as well as control construction and labor costs?","Stuart A. Miller","No. First of all, I don't think that we're managing our deliveries. And I think that we've highlighted that we're very focused on generating strong margins, and so we've had a very measured approach to both sales and starts. I highlighted in my remarks that looking, watching our gross margins, you're seeing that we have a very carefully programmed approach to pricing our product, making sure that we're maintaining margins. So this has been something that's been consistent over the past years. In terms of what is affecting our backlog delivery ratio is the fact then we are -- we've seen a fairly aggressive strong move in sales. We are probably selling a higher percentage right now of unstarted homes, of homes that will take -- that will have more cycle time remaining in them. So as we face the third quarter deliveries, we recognize that we're simply not going to be able to deliver as high a percentage of the backlog, and this is just what we're seeing as we sit here today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Micenko of Susquehanna International Group.","John R. Benda - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","This is John Benda on for Jack. I just had a couple of quick questions for you. First is that with our regional bank coverage we're seeing increased mortgage repurchase reserving, I just wonder if you guys saw any of those trends in your Financial Services unit in the quarter?","Stuart A. Miller","No, we did not see any significant trend there, no.","John R. Benda - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So there are no new [indiscernible]. And then as a follow-up with the DTA reversal, I know you listed about 8 factors. Was Lennar's cumulative loss position a big consideration in the valuation allowance reversal? Or was that not looked at or just not given much weight?","Bruce E. Gross","The cumulative loss is something that is evaluated, but we're still in a cumulative loss position. So there has to be a significant positive [indiscernible] that comes into place, and it has to be significant while you're still in that cumulative loss position. So that was taken into account, but there was enough positive evidence that allowed us to reverse the DTA.","John R. Benda - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Great. And was there a PPIP mark in the quarter?","Bruce E. Gross","It was negligible. It was a couple [indiscernible] thousand dollars.","Stuart A. Miller","All right. Very good. We'll wrap it up here. I know that we took a little bit long with our opening remarks, but we wanted to cover a lot of ground. We certainly appreciate everybody joining us for our second quarter update and look forward to reporting our quarter -- on the third quarter.

And we request, as always, that in our Q&A period that everyone please limit to just one question and one follow-up so that we can be as fair as possible to everybody who'd like to ask. ","So 2 days ago on CNBC, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan highlighted that he believed that housing was at or nearing the bottom of this downturn, and I believe he's correct. I previewed in our third quarter conference call 3 months ago that we were beginning to see evidence of a genuine turn in residential and the residential housing market, and that this could be a harbinger of market stability. Last quarter, I was not ready to conclude that a real trend had been identified. This quarter, I'm feeling somewhat more confident that the market is, in fact, changing. ","As I noted earlier, we have just completed our 2-day review of all of operating divisions across the country. We've looked back at our 2011 results, and we've looked ahead to 2012 expectations. The consistent message is that the general environment is different this year than it has been in the past. There are discernible fundamental shifts appearing in the home market, and there are empirical compliments that are to date confirmatory that the market is showing signs of stability. ","Home prices and volumes have been falling for 7 years now. Prices are down some 20% to 50% depending on the market, and new home starts and sales are at post-depression lows. Concurrently, interest rates are at historic lows. According to HUD, homes are more affordable to purchase today than they've been since 1971 as a result of these falling home prices and low interest rates. Today's consumers are beginning to realize that housing represents an undeniable value proposition. And accordingly, demand is growing and we are seeing it in the field at most of our communities. ","Now demand is constrained by the mortgage qualification standards and processes that define today's mortgage market, and that has been overcorrected by the severity of the downturn. But the demand is growing and looking to find some loosening of those credit standards. Today's consumer is looking at the home purchase differently than in the past -- in past years. The home purchase is no longer the place to invest savings in order to ride a wave of price increases. Instead, today's buyers are looking for real value, and they're finding real value in for-sale housing. ","First, the fully loaded cost of ownership is lower in most desirable markets than comparable rental rates. While this might not show up in national statistics, in local competitive markets, principal, interest, taxes, insurance, community association costs and lawn care are together lower than the competitive rental market. Today, for-sale housing represents an excellent value proposition. ","Secondly, they are looking for an alternative to the rental market. Rental prices are high and they've been moving up, and they reprice every 12 months. Today's consumers are looking for a domicile that provides living cost stability, as well as stable and a safe place to raise a family. They are looking to reconsider the rental lifestyle where rental rates have been rising and are likely to continue to rise for the foreseeable future. ","In our fourth quarter, we've seen real evidence of these changes in the field. We are experiencing more traffic in our welcome home centers, and customers are actively discussing their desire to find a way to purchase and avoid the rental market and its repricing. Perhaps most importantly, we've seen consistent sales pace at stabilized prices throughout our fourth quarter and even through December, during the season that is generally the most difficult time of the year. Our steady traffic and sales rate indicate stronger demand trend than prior years when sales just dropped off at this time of the year. ","New orders are up 20% over last year, and our backlog is up 35% over last year. These improved results come with prices and margins that are consistent with or marginally better than our current deliveries, which indicates that we are not and have not been reaching for volume. It is likely that the national members will not reflect these results because they will incorporate in their data many tertiary markets that did not affect our competitive landscape. But the more desirable housing markets are experiencing a fundamental change as foreclosure inventories have been absorbed in these markets and the consumer recognizes the value proposition. This is the consistent message from our divisions, reflecting their interactions in the field. ","Now let me give you a few brief comments on our fourth quarter and year end. It's well documented that 2011 has been another difficult year for the housing market. Prices continued to decline across the country by another 4-plus percent, while the volume of new homes sold in the U.S. has remained at historically low levels. Against this backdrop, we've performed consistently on all fronts. All of our business segments, Homebuilding, Financial Services and Rialto, have remained profitable in the quarter and for the year, producing $0.16 for the quarter and $0.48 for the year. Most importantly, the basic metrics that define our business have been carefully managed through this difficult year. Margins have remained consistently high and we expect will remain in the 19.5% to 21.5% range in 2012. SG&A has been improving through the year and was at 13.8% for the quarter. Average sales price has been steady at about $243,000, while incentives have been declining. Alongside of our Homebuilding activities, our Financial Services group has also been holding steady and positioning for recovery while remaining profitable as well. ","Our Rialto segment has also produced consistent profit as it's grown through a turbulent year. While Rialto earnings have been clouded by mark-to-market adjustments relative to our PPIP securities program, with these adjustments stripped away, we are starting to see the real earnings power of the Rialto machine. Rialto completed its money raised for its first fund in Q4 and ended with a $700 million pool of capital to invest in strategic assets to drive its future. To date, about 70% of that fund is invested and the pipeline for new investments is strong. As we look ahead, Rialto should continue to be a solid earnings contributor for Lennar and will begin to return cash to corporate as it is now investing self-generated funds. ","All in all, 2011 has been an excellent year for Lennar as we have navigated the turbulent waters of the housing market and the U.S. economy, seeking a bottom and grasping for stability. Our strategy has been to refine and position our company for recovery and remain marginally profitable while we stay patient, and we've done exactly that. All of the segments of our company are extremely well positioned as you will now hear from our operating team. As I look ahead to 2012, I am cautiously optimistic that we are seeing a real bottom form and that we will begin to see signs of recovery. ","National statistics and news will give us mixed signals as we move through the year, as they represent a compendium of all of the best and the worst markets around the country. But I feel that stabilization and recovery will emanate from the most desirable markets and spread slowly outward over years. Lennar is positioned with a strong balance sheet in the right market, with an exceptional management team and a well-constructed strategy to perform solidly as market conditions begin to improve. ","With that, let me turn over to Rick Beckwitt.","Richard Beckwitt","Thanks, Stuart. During the fourth quarter, we continue to focus on acquiring or auctioning new homesites that would have a positive impact on our bottom line. Our primary focus was pursuing distressed opportunities, and we spent a lot of time in one-on-one negotiations with banks and other extremely motivated sellers. This quarter, we purchased approximately 3,800 homesites totaling approximately $162 million, and we spent approximately $56 million on land development. In addition, we auctioned almost 1,100 homesites. ","Our new acquisitions were located in markets where we saw the greatest market strength and value proposition. Our focus within these markets has been on highly desirable communities located in sub-markets where people really want to live and where foreclosed homes have already been absorbed. Whether the hook is schools, spectacular amenities, commute time, each one of these new deals has been hand selected with a very specific target buyer and product in mind. In short, we invested in A-plus assets and stayed away from the fringe or tertiary locations where price was the only driver and where foreclosure activity remains. We also have insisted that we have a cost-effective home design in hand before we buy any land, which has allowed us to streamline the time period between when we buy land and when we're open for sale. It's been a true cash-on-cash focus. ","From a geographic standpoint, during the fourth quarter approximately 33% of our new acquisitions were located in Florida, 19% in the Carolinas, 14% in Maryland and Virginia, 11% in California, 10% in Texas, with the remaining 13% spread throughout our other markets. As in prior quarters, the lion's share of our new land deals were sourced outside of a competitive bid environment. We've stayed away from the typical broker-to-bid type deals and rolled up our sleeves and directly sourced of the majority of our land transactions. ","In many of our acquisitions, with the help of our Rialto operation, we have purchased debt at a deep discount and subsequently foreclosed on real estate at an incredibly attractive land basis. We have also backed into land through the purchase of community development district farms, tax certificates, deed in lieus and short sale arrangements. In fact, some of the more complicated and unique transactions have created the most upside earnings potential. Regardless of how each deal was sourced, all of our new deals in the quarter were underwritten with extremely conservative assumptions. As in the past, they have assumed no price appreciation and in many cases, price declines and slower absorption basis. In all of these deals, we have required gross margins to exceed 20% and IRRs to exceed 20%. ","To date, we've been extremely pleased with the performance of our new land acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, approximately 41% of our deliveries came from communities purchased to put under contract during the last 3 years. Our gross margin on the closings in these communities was approximately 200 basis points higher than the gross margin for the entire company in the fourth quarter. ","Outside of our traditional land acquisition activities, in late December, we expanded our operations into the Pacific Northwest through the acquisition of a portfolio of communities from Seattle-based Premier Communities. Led by Ryan McGowan, Premier has been delivering homes and developing land in the Seattle area for several decades. We now own and control approximately 855 homesites in 23 communities. These communities are ideally situated in a very tight and constrained land market. We are extremely excited with the prospects of this new operation and welcome Ryan and his team to the Lennar family. ","Before I turn it over to Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, let me give you some final stats. On a year-over-year basis, our inventory increased about $300 million to approximately $4 billion and this excludes consolidated inventory not owned and an approximately $14 million investment in Seattle in the first quarter of 2012. Since the beginning of 2009 when we really started our land acquisition efforts, we've invested over $1.5 billion to purchase approximately 32,700 homesites. ","In addition, we have auctioned several thousand additional homesites during this period. As reflected in our industry-leading gross margins, which have increased significantly during this time period, there can be no question that we've invested wisely. At November 30, we owned and controlled 111,386 homesites and had 422 active committees. As we move through 2012, you should see a 5% to 10% increase in our community count and a continued positive contribution to our operating margins from our new investments. ","I'd like to thank our Lennar and Rialto associates for their hard work during 2011. I have no doubt that we have the most talented team in the business. ","I'd like Jon to now talk about the operations.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Thank you, Rick, and good morning. We are very proud of the pre-impairment 21.6% gross margin and 7.8% operating margin we delivered in our fourth quarter, respectively, 80 and 110 basis point improvements. This achievement did not come about without a lot of focus and attention by management on each of the component parts of our business. I would like to speak to our company strategy on maximizing sales and margins, our intense focus on managing direct costs and our overall focus on leveraging our operating structure to reduce overhead levels. Our sales focus remains a market by market, community by community understanding of today's home-buying consumers' wants and needs. ","Through the execution of our Everything's Included platform, we deliver value by targeting the right product and features in every community. Each Lennar division offers home designs, square footages and included features that present a great value to the homebuyer. Lennar's Everything's Included approach is especially effective as we compete against resales by highlighting the energy-efficient, technological and quality features that demonstrate there's nothing like new when it comes to buying a home. ","Much of our sales strength in the fourth quarter was driven by the performance of our new communities where we are achieving a higher sales pace as compared to our legacy communities. These new communities are well located, properly positioned and priced to appeal to today's homebuyers. As Rick noted, 41% of our deliveries were from new communities. New orders from these same new communities increased from 27% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 44% in the fourth quarter of 2011. ","Overall, as Stuart mentioned, we are seeing better traffic both in terms of quality and quantity, but more so from the quality perspective, representing the customer desire to make a buying decision now. While we are seeing these better patterns, we also continued to experience a very difficult mortgage approval environment, which is restricting the ability of a growing demand to become homebuyers. As the mortgage market eventually corrects itself, we expect more of this demand to be freed up. ","In the fourth quarter, we saw strong year-over-year sales growth in all of the Florida markets, Atlanta and North Carolina in the Southeast; Phoenix and Vegas in the Southwest; and in parts of California. There was a slight pickup in Houston but overall, Texas was relatively flat. While we don't give data on the current quarter activity, I can tell you that we saw improved year-over-year sales trends through December. And while the year-over-year improvement varies slightly by market from the fourth quarter, every one of our markets showed improvement in December from the prior year. ","Our management team is also very focused on the cost side of the margin equation. Our current average direct cost of homes remains around $40 per square foot. We maintained this cost level by value engineering at a more granular level than we have ever before. Our costs are broken down into detailed categories where we measure performance of these categories across all of our divisions. This, combined with detailed and effective management of the building process in the field, has allowed us to keep our costs down by over 30% from the 2006 peak. This has been accomplished this year despite various fluctuations of some materials and commodities. I want to recognize the hard work of our national and local purchasing teams along with our operating divisions for their drive in finding new solutions and implementing new processes that allow us to deliver better quality and value in the home. ","We have also maintained our focus on cycle time, which is down almost 30% from the peak. This represents an average build time of between 90 to 100 calendar days for single-family detached homes. We have accomplished this by working hard with our -- hard and hand in hand with our trade partners in designing and building more efficient value-engineered homes. This effort has allowed us to control our field costs and effectively manage the delivery of our inventory. ","We have also maintained our intense focus on management of our SG&A. Our SG&A for the fourth quarter was at 13.8%, which is the lowest level we have achieved in 5 years. This represents a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year and begins to show the opportunity to leverage our operating structure. This was accomplished despite the start-up costs associated with our new community growth, as well as the commissions associated with greater broker participation. There is an increasing trend of third-party brokers bringing their buyers to us, which we believe is evidence of the growing awareness of the ease and value of the new home purchase versus resale. ","Now I'll put our overhead focus into perspective. The fourth quarter spend of $112 million compares to $484 million in Q4 of 2006. As Stuart and Rick have mentioned, we have just completed our operations reviews with each of our Homebuilding divisions. Across-the-board, we have a team that is energized to execute on our strategy of maximizing sales revenue, reducing the cost of sales and delivering industry-leading operating margins. ","Thank you, and I'd now like to turn it over to Jeff Krasnoff.","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. As Stuart mentioned in his opening remarks, Rialto is beginning to hit its stride and demonstrate its earnings capacity. Before Bruce reviews the details behind Rialto's $8 million of operating earnings along with the results of the rest of the company, there are a few areas that might be helpful to touch on to give you a little bit more perspective on what's going on at Rialto. ","With the backdrop of uncertainty in Europe, we've nonetheless continued to see what amounts to positive dynamics for the new deal flow in the markets in which we operate. U.S. banks are still under pressure to sell real estate assets, and the prospected foreign banks will also be shedding assets since added further downward pressure on the pricing of many opportunities especially where we believe we continue to have a competitive advantage. Therefore, the opportunity to purchase both real estate back loans and securities is as strong, if not stronger than ever. And we remain focused on evaluating. And if we can continue to price advantageously acquiring distressed portfolios, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other related assets through our current exclusive investment vehicle, the Rialto Real Estate Fund. ","As Stuart mentioned, during the quarter the fund had its final closing of equity commitments, bringing the total to $700 million, including the $75 million commitment from us and from over 2 dozen different investor groups. The fund has now been able to acquire or tie up a total of 28 different negotiated transactions, and our pipeline of new potential investments remains strong. This has resulted in the investment of a little over $500 million of fund equity to acquire almost $1.5 billion of assets based on unpaid principal balance, for about $0.37 on the dollar. And now with about $200 million of equity remaining to be called, we're currently focusing on bringing out our next investment fund. We believe these in future vehicles will not only help to enhance the company's returns and add consistent cash flows back to corporate, but will also be important building blocks for us to develop a first-class Investment Management business. ","Almost 75% of our fund investments so far have been distressed portfolios from regional and community banks, CMBS special servicers and non-bank financial institutions. The remaining investments are in new issue CMBS securities with strong current cash flows, where we have found risk-adjusted pricing dynamics unlike any we have seen since the early days of that business dating back to the mid-1990s. ","Our focused Rialto team of 180 strong continues to push the resolution process forward, enhanced by the well-coordinated resources of the rest of the Lennar team. Being able to integrate the unique talents of a leading nationwide residential developer and homebuilder has been and continues to be a unique advantage for us. And in turn, as part of this active collaboration led by Eric Feder who oversees our bank relationships, the Homebuilding divisions have been able to continue to capture distressed opportunities from the same institutions we have been working with on the portfolios. As you have heard, this is providing a great mechanism to generate new communities for homebuilding at extremely attractive pricing. ","Since we began investing in distressed assets, at the end of the first quarter of 2010 we have, as of now, collected gross over $550 million of cash, including over $120 million from the sales of real estate owned. Included as part of this, the FDIC transaction partnerships now hold over $320 million of cash on their balance sheets, including approximately $260 million earmarked to defease the $627 million of FDIC seller financing. ","Market uncertainty has been responsible for keeping us from having one of our most profitable quarters yet as a result of the $7.6 million unrealized loss related to our share of the mark-to-market on our PPIP fund. And for the year these marks have aggregated $21.4 million. However, these marks as required by U.S. Treasury, we believe, reflect more of the general sentiment in the marketplace related to the potential need for European banks to liquidate fixed income assets. We have not changed our view of the resilient underlying cash flows that we used to underwrite and price our PPIP investments. In fact, our PPIP fund has been actively looking to acquire additional securities. And to date, exclusive of the marks, we've already recognized approximately $23 million in interest income and fees related to our $68 million investment in and management of the fund. ","So these are just a few of the reasons we remain very excited about the continued progress of our Rialto franchise, our current position in the marketplace and the synergies with the rest of the Lennar team. ","Thank you, and I'll turn it over to Bruce.","Bruce E. Gross","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of profitability, and our fourth quarter results reflect strong core operating earnings that were partially offset by Homebuilding impairments of $17.9 million and a PPIP mark-to-market that Jeff discussed. That's an unrealized loss of $7.6 million. ","Let me review the numbers in all 3 segments, starting with Homebuilding. Revenues from home sales increased 13% to $817 million, driven by a 10% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 2% increase in average sales price to $243,000. The average sales price by region is as follows, and please note that we were required to change our reportable segments this quarter as noted in our press release, so you will see a new Southeast Florida region while Georgia and the Carolinas have moved from the other region to the East region. East average sales price was $221,000, up 3%; Southeast Florida was $265,000, up 1%; Central was $211,000, up 2%; Houston $228,000, up 5%; West $307,000, down 3%; and other was $339,000, down 9%. ","As was mentioned, our gross margin on home sales before impairments was 21.6% in the fourth quarter, which was an 80 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. In our last conference call, we provided a gross margin percentage range for the fourth quarter before impairments of 19% to 21%. We exceeded this range due to delivery of more favorable product mix of higher gross margin percentage deliveries, which includes an increasing percentage of deliveries from new communities that was mentioned, and that's now 41% of our deliveries. ","The gross margins were strongest in the East and the Southeast Florida regions this quarter. Sales incentives as a percentage of home sale revenue decreased 20 basis points to 12.2% in the fourth quarter versus 12.4% in the prior year. As a result of the strong gross margins that were mentioned and the improvement in SG&A that Jon discussed, our Homebuilding operating margins before impairment improved 110 basis points from the prior year to 7.8%. ","During the quarter, we recognized the $4.7 million net gain relating to an asset distribution from a JV. This was a linked transaction reflected on 2 income statement lines, earnings from unconsolidated entities and other income. When a joint venture determines it is disposing of assets, it needs to evaluate the assets at the lower of cost or market. As a result, the joint venture was required to book an impairment. The company's share of this joint venture impairment was $57.6 million charge. As part of the joint venture distribution, the company received assets that were fair valued above its remaining investment account balance, and that resulted in the $62.3 million gain. The impairments during the quarter on the Homebuilding side were $17.9 million, and that compares to $22.3 million in the prior year. ","Turning to Financial Services, that business segment generated operating earnings of $9.1 million versus $11.7 million last year. Mortgage pretax income was $9.1 million versus $11.1 million in the prior year. And during the quarter, we successfully entered into another confidential settlement with the second of the 3 large banks that purchased the vast majority of our mortgage originations. This settlement which totaled $2 million was within the accrued liability on our books for a potential mortgage put-back exposure, and we now have a remaining liability of approximately $6 million. And we are comfortable that that's adequate for any future exposure. Our title company generated $1.5 million of profits versus $1 million in the prior year. And additionally, the Financial Services result include a $1.3 million reserve for the disposition of our last remaining cable system. ","As Jeff mentioned, our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings totaling $8 million, and this number includes $2 million of net losses attributable to non-controlling interest. Rialto's operating earnings before the PPIP mark-to-market adjustments have showed significant improvement, growing to $15.6 million during the quarter versus $7.7 million in the prior year, netting out the prior year's PPIP mark-to-market gain. The composition of Rialto's $8 million of operating earnings by type of investment is as follows: the FDIC portfolio contribution this quarter was breakeven; the non-FDIC portfolios generated a $17.3 million gain; PPIP, net of interest income and the mark-to-market had a $4.8 million loss; and there were $2 million contributed from the Rialto Real Estate Fund. This was offset by approximately $6.4 million of general and administrative expenses, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of approximately $3.7 million. ","Although revenue from the FDIC portfolios were higher in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, we experienced higher expenses relating primarily to property taxes and legal expenses relating to both servicing loans and REO, resulting in the breakeven quarter for the FDIC portfolios. The $17.3 million contribution from the non-FDIC portfolios this quarter are primarily from deficiency recoveries, accretable interest income, gains upon foreclosure and sales of REO net of REO expenses. Our 15% interest in the Rialto Real Estate Fund generated approximately $2 million of profits, which is in addition to the management fees highlighted above. The $4.8 million loss during the quarter from our investment in PPIP is reported as equity and earnings from unconsolidated entities, and this loss is comprised of $7.6 million of unrealized loss due to mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by a $2.8 million of interest income. ","The success of the Rialto Real Estate Fund has enabled us to grow Rialto using the third-party capital. During the quarter, the company didn't invest any new capital in the Rialto segment. Rialto continues to generate strong cash flow. And at quarter end, there was already $219 million in the defeasance cash account to retire debt, and there was an additional $84 million of cash on Rialto's balance sheet. ","The company recognized a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of $13.7 million relating to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state tax issues. In computing our earnings per share for the quarter, the add back for interest relating to our convertible debt is $871,000. We concluded the year with a strong liquid balance sheet. Our leverage remained low as our Homebuilding debt to total capital net of the $1 billion of cash was 46.4%. During the quarter, we paid off maturing senior notes of $113 million. There are no maturities now until 2013, and we raised $400 million of new convertible notes with a 3.25% rate and a 37.5% premium and we received $350 million of that cash in the current quarter. Shareholders equity ended the year at $2.7 billion, and that's a book value per share amount of $14.31. This book value per share does not include the fully reserved deferred tax asset which is currently at $577 million or $3.06 per outstanding share. ","At year end the company, with the consultation of its auditors, evaluated whether the reserve on its deferred tax asset is still needed. The relevant accounting guidance requires a very high threshold in order to conclude that the reserve is no longer needed. Although the company's strong performance and current positioning is bringing it closer to a conclusion that the reserve is no longer needed, we have concluded to defer a reversal until further evidence that the housing market recovery has been revealed. ","We ended 2011 with our strongest quarterly backlog growth since 2002, up 35%. This strong backlog, coupled with our focus on strong gross margin percentages, positions us for another year of profitability in 2012. Stuart indicated we are increasing our gross margin expectations for 2012 to be in a range of 19.5% to 21.5%. And as usual, our first quarter is expected to have seasonally lighter volume and gross margins at the lower end of our range, making it tougher to be profitable in the first quarter. However, we are well positioned and we are looking forward to another year of profitability throughout the remainder of 2012. ","And with that, let me open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","You had mentioned, Stuart, some brief comments about rent inflation helping to some extent for people to reevaluate the economics as it relates to owning versus renting. Do you have any data that might support that in terms of serving the traffic cuts coming through, or people that are actually signing sales contracts that are saying they've been renters? And maybe some anecdotes that can help us understand the opportunity? Certainly there's plenty of people that arguably have been delaying purchases that might be a significant opportunity, and I just want to hear your thoughts on that, please.","Stuart A. Miller","Yes. When we talk about data, data gets a little bit convoluted. What we specifically did, Ivy, is we went out and looked at the competitive landscape relative to communities in specific markets. And we actually put together a little presentation on it that we've shared in some of our presentations and we'll probably continue to. And we've looked at the fully loaded cost of homeownership as compared with the rental rates that are in a competitive radius of communities where we are actively selling. So this is real information from real markets where we're competing. Now if you were to broaden the thought -- the radius, if you were to expand the radius, you might find that the data doesn't hold up. But in a real competitive environment at a local level, we're finding that there are 2 things at work. Number one is a value proposition, where fully loaded cost of homeownership is at or lower, and generally lower than the competitive rental communities. And then perhaps more importantly, in the more desirable areas rental prices, which reprice every 12 months, have been trending upward, anywhere from 5% to 15% on selected markets, and it is a combination of the value proposition and the notion that the cost of living expenses are going to go up, are going up and are going to continue to go up that are driving people to say, I've got to lock this expense down or it can run away from me. It is reducing my personal disposable income when wages are not rising. And so it's driving more traffic to our sales centers.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","Just to -- I don't want to say this is my follow up question because I'm going to save that one but just to clarify, Stuart, on your analysis, this doesn't also include the benefit assuming the mortgage interest deduction, as well as assuming you're talking comparing apartment renting to single-family ownership, just to clarify? And then I have a follow-up.","Stuart A. Miller","Okay, yes. That's a good clarification, so we won't count it as your follow-up. But we actually decidedly did not include the mortgage interest deduction because of all of the discussion out there that it could be, might be vulnerable. We wanted to take a more pure look as a consumer might look at it. Any time there's a question mark, it might be discounted. Even without the mortgage interest deduction, the comparison is favorable in many communities across the country, ownership versus renting.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","This is Jon. I would also add that seeing surveys, I don't know exactly the group survey, but in realty publications that consistently state that a very high percentage, around 70% of renters do look at homeownership in their future. And I would also just add anecdotally in select markets, I've heard from apartment owners the increasing number of the churn over going to homeownership versus other rentals.","Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division","No, we've heard the same, and we did a survey like that, Jon. Maybe you're reading our survey so hopefully, that was the case. But to bring up my second question, Stuart, you've talked about the stringency of mortgage availability. Certainly, everyone recognizes that. But what I'd like you to hopefully clarify to the listeners is that mortgage credit maybe stringent, but I don't believe that there are people that were limited in terms of the pool of people that, assuming confidence comes back, that mortgages are not going to be something that would limit the number of homebuyers. In other words, you grew -- your year-over-year sales were up 20%. Assuming those people are going to close with modest cancellations, I would assume that there's no change favorably to mortgage availability, but you have more confidence that people are stepping into the market. So if I ask you in 3 years from now and you were seeing a pickup in sales activity, would you say there's a limit to how faster sales can grow because of the mortgage stringency? Or is it really more confidence that's limiting you and there's plenty of people that have higher than a 640 FICO score, or that can come up with 5% or 10% down payment, it's just a confidence issue that's really limiting it and certainly, it would help to have easier credit but it doesn't, at least the mortgage companies we talked to, doesn't limit the opportunity to see a recovery in housing?","Stuart A. Miller","Well look, I think I want to be careful not to be guided by your question. But I think that the mortgage market under all circumstances right now is choppy, and the process for mortgage approval is somewhat limiting. There are many people who don't have the qualifications. Some of the -- many of the people that don't have the qualifications are burning off the needed years between a short sale or a bankruptcy or a foreclosure to get to the point where they're allowed to get back into the mortgage market. Some of them are regenerating a good credit score. Some of them are accumulating a down payment. The qualification side of the mortgage market is difficult, it's choppy and it is somewhat limited today, but we are living in a dynamic world where that's changing. At the same time, the process has become intensely cumbersome. The request for documentation seems to be never ending. And the process, together with the qualifications, are the result of an overcorrection. That overcorrection, in my opinion, is going to find a way to burn off, that is the overcorrection is going to find a way to burn off over time. But as with any pendulum swing, it takes some time for the pendulum to find its equilibrium, and I believe it will. So with demand coming to the market in an increased measure and with the mortgage qualification market and process being somewhat stringent and limiting, I think the 2 will work together, increased demand and mortgage market reaching equilibrium. And over time, we're going to see demand really start to peak up. Now whether that's in 2012 or whether it takes more time for the markets to settle and stuff, it's yet to be seen and I don't want to opine on that. But I think that over time, we're going to see demand push through the stringency of the mortgage market.","Operator","The next question is coming from Stephen Kim, Barclays Capital.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I also believe that you don't -- that the mortgage availability really isn't the primary impediment, that it's primarily an issue of confidence. In that vein, I was wondering if you could talk about the trends you're seeing in traffic relative to the trends that we saw in orders or you are seeing in orders? Are you seeing traffic increase at a faster rate year-over-year or however you choose to look at it relative to orders or vice versa?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","It varies slightly from market to market. But we are, I think in general, seeing traffic increase at a faster rate. But I said earlier that the biggest difference we're seeing is in a greater desire to make the buying decision as compared to prior periods in the year.","Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, that's really great. I guess the second question that I had relates to your subdivision count. In particular, what I'm curious about is you would think you had given guidance that community count being up roughly 5% or so in 2012 but obviously, if what you're seeing now is in fact a harbinger of an improved spring selling season? One would think that you might be tempted to tweak up your subdivision count to capture some of that volume. You having one of those stronger balance sheets in the industry will be better able to do that, one would think. So I was curious if you could give us an idea of your capacity to increase your subdivision count greater than the 5% that you mentioned?","Richard Beckwitt","Steve, it's Rick. There's no question we've got the dry powder to press it up if the opportunities are there. But as you've seen us over the last several years, we've been investing wisely. As the market starts to increase, we're going to get increased absorptions from our existing communities. We'll invest in new communities. And there's no question in my mind that if there are good deals out there, we'll find them first. With regard to community count in 2011, what I can tell you is while we did give guidance through the year that we saw community count would be up, there's a lot of communities that come in and out intra-quarter, either through auction deals where we have very little or no earnest money that you guys don't see. If they're successful, they stay on; if they're not, we move out. But most of those things still add to positive contribution on a net margin basis intra-quarter. So as we look at 2012, we gave guidance for a 5% to 10% increase. I think it'll be every bit of that, but we're going to just invest wisely throughout the year.","Operator","The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question. I was hoping just to get perhaps a little bit more granular on the order trends during the quarter. And it looks like absorption or sales per community actually improved 8%, 10% sequentially versus, I think, as Stuart, you said last year, fell off a little bit as is typical in 4Q versus 3Q. I was wondering if you could kind of take us through if that was driven by a couple of submarkets? Certainly there's huge order growth in Southeast Florida or the fact that as a mix basis, you have a higher percentage of newer communities. I think you said driving 44% of your orders, if that kind of picked up materially from the third quarter? Any more granularity there would be helpful.","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Okay. The new orders in the quarter, we indicated about 44% were coming from the new communities. But we've seen most of that success, and I think Jon got into this a bit, coming from more of the new communities that we've been opening. But it's really been throughout the quarter, a success throughout the country. It hasn't been one market that we've experienced the success.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","A little more color. I think that the areas where we saw the greatest improvement in sales from new communities, as we mentioned, was Southeast Florida, but also in central Florida and the Raleigh area, as an example. In Dallas-Fort Worth and then Texas, we saw that pickup. And Orange County, California, in Colorado, markets like that we had dramatic increases and our activity in our new communities year-over-year.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I guess the second question just on the gross margins. It looks like you're kind of increasing the range that you think is possible by maybe 50 bps or more. And this quarter, you exceeded the range that you had guided to in terms of 21.6% over the 21% high end of the range. Is there any reason to think that you wouldn't be able to at least achieve the higher end of this range for fiscal '12 outside of any major mixed shift in deliveries maybe by region? Because certainly over the last couple of quarters now, you've been at that high end of the range. Any color there would be helpful, particularly as you kind of pointed to this quarter being also positively influenced by mix?","Stuart A. Miller","Well let me say this, Mike. We've given a range, and I think that that's where we're comfortable right now. There are moving parts, and we are rounding the corner to come into our first quarter. Our first quarter is always lighter volume. We have lower expectations for our first quarter, and we want to make sure that we keep everybody's perspective properly focused on the short-term and the longer-term year-end. So we are giving a range. We did throw out a couple of numbers, and I want to make sure that they're clear. 44% of our new orders came from new communities and 41% of our deliveries came from new communities. So you can see that we have a -- kind of a trend wise, new communities are increasing their representation in the flow or in the composition of our gross margin. But we recognize that our first quarter is likely to be a little bit lighter. So where will we be within that range? We're going to wait and see what the composition brings to us. But we do feel comfortable number one, with the range we put out there; and number 2, with the fact that we did bring the range up by about 50 bps.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. One quick follow-up on the first question, if it's possible, on the community count. You were down 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and you're guiding for up 5% to 10% for the full year. Would we expect that 5% to 10% to be more back-half weighted? Or should we expect more of a move in the first quarter?","Bruce E. Gross","As we announced in a press release on the Pacific Northwest, we brought in some additional communities in the Seattle area. So you'll see some community count growth as those start to build out through the year. Most of those opportunities were really land or option contracts that we got to get going in. The Seattle market's a little bit unique. They're smaller communities from an overall size standpoint, so their overall contributions as a whole will be somewhat less. But with regard to the overall year, you'll see it more in the back end half of the year and it's going to be skewed somewhat by what the opportunities are out there.","Operator","The next question is coming from David Goldberg, UBS.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Susan on for David today. First of all, I wanted to get your thoughts around some of the recent news that we've seen regarding government efforts to support housing. A week or so ago, the fed came up with a report that suggests the government could be warming up to the idea of allowing some larger, more institutional capital to play perhaps a more meaningful role in the buy-to-rent market. Can you just kind of give us your thoughts on this, and maybe what you think it could indicate in terms of the government supporting different initiatives to help housing?","Stuart A. Miller","Well, there have -- I think that there's been more than just the discussion of the government buy-to-rent program. There's also been part 2.0 that's been out there. The most important thing to think about is the fact that the government is recognizing that stability in the housing market is important, and it's important to refocus the attention on how we enable the housing market to recover. And I think that portends good things for housing in general. Certainly, redeploying some of the idle inventory to the rental market will be helpful. It will bring less supply on the for-sale market and will enable the for-sale market to absorb the overhang of foreclosures more rapidly. It will deploy those assets into much needed rental housing. And anything that the government can do to enable the borrowing -- the borrowers out there to decide not to strategically default will help the foreclosure market begin to resolve itself as well. So our thoughts are that together with fundamental demand coming back, anything that reduces the amount of supply of foreclosure homes on the market is going to be a benefit. And the government is certainly thinking and working in that direction.","Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just as a quick follow-up, I think it was Jon that mentioned your ability to maintain your direct cost over the quarter. Given the volatility we've seen in some commodities and the fact that maybe conditions are starting to stabilize a bit, are you starting to see any increased pressure from some of your suppliers to raise prices? And are you having to push back anymore on this? And talk a little bit about maybe how you're offsetting it if you are seeing any of that?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Yes. As I mentioned, there have been impacts from certain materials or commodities. The most recent example of that, I think everyone is aware of, is drywall where there's been increases. We focus on both maintaining our cost on a material, focus item-by-item, but also on the process. And as I said, really managing the opportunities to find at a very detailed level the value and what's happening out in the field, what's happening within our cost codes item-by-item and really driving efficiencies in that regard. So it's a constant battle of managing the fluctuations in the material and commodity market with what we can do operationally to offset that and maintain a low-cost.","Operator","The next question is coming from Stephen East, Ticonderoga Securities.","Stephen F. East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division","Stuart, you talked -- or in the press release, you all talked about incentives, and they've stayed sort of flat. If we look at that, what's a normalized level? And if we're starting to see the market recover and order trends pickup, et cetera, do you expect that to start to drop as we move through 2012? Or is that more an entrenched type process that we're going through?","Stuart A. Miller","Well look, incentives are a funny thing. On a more normalized level -- let me go back to really normalized market conditions, you're in the 5% to 10% range. And incentives are in part a composition of sale price. It's kind of a tricky thing to figure out where things actually lie. The fact is that the market is stabilizing, and the first place that we're going to see sales price regenerate itself is with the incentives. And certainly, that is stabilizing and coming down a little bit and contributing to our margins.","Stephen F. East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. Do you expect the incentives to back off as we move through the year?","Stuart A. Miller","Well Stephen, I have a perspective that the market is stabilizing. It's going to take some recovery for the incentives to really back off. On the one hand, I think that I feel cautiously optimistic about what is happening with the market right now and into 2012, but I don't want to get ahead of this market. It's been choppy and rocky. And so I'd say we're going to wait and see. We're going to carefully manage our business and manage the process. I can tell you that Rick and Jon are looking at incentives and sales prices every single day with every division, and that is being managed week-by-week in the field. So to the extent that the market allows it, we're going to be right on it and make sure that incentives are coming down.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","This is Jon. I would add, too, that the foreclosure environment is still out there and we compete against it. And how we position our product with incentives, without incentives, as we compete to show the new home has a value, is going to continue to sort of affect what you see in terms of incentive levels. So Stuart said you've got to be really careful and you analyze it between both sales price and incentives and how you're positioning value.","Bruce E. Gross","Steve, we're managing the business to a net price across the line or below the line. In a more normalized market, it's closing costs. We're not at that juncture right now. But as the market recovers, that's the direction that we're going to take it. It will take us a while to get there.","Stephen F. East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division","I got you. So a lot of it's optics to get to that net price. The other thing investors, when they look at this space, they've listened to a lot of the builders talk about all right, we have a tremendous ability to ramp up our operational leverage because we're selling at 2 homes and when we get to 4, we still don't need to add people, et cetera. We're still not seeing it; we haven't really seen it in your numbers this quarter. Is there something going on this quarter on a year-over-year basis that your SG&A really didn't change? And do you expect that to start to change pretty rapidly if you start piling on 20% a quarter-type order rates?","Stuart A. Miller","Well Stephen, it's important to look right now at -- we're at a -- an interesting point, if we look back at the year 2011, we're really flat with 2010. So there's really not any real operational leverage that has been liberated at this point. As I noted in my comments, our posture has been to navigate the toughest part of this market as it looks for a recovery and to remain marginally profitable as we stay patient. And so the operational leverage that we and other builders have talked about has not yet presented itself. The movement from 1 to 1.5 to 2 sales to 4 sales per community per month will present itself and present itself, I think, very decidedly when we start to see real recovery in the marketplace. And we're just not quite there yet. So looking back at 2011, we're kind of flat. As we start to see volumes jump up, those volumes should have an embedded operational leverage in them.","Stephen F. East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. If I can sneak in one quick one, on the PPIP, the mark-to-market, are these securities typically held to maturity?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Yes. I mean, that was the plan, Stephen. When we buy them, we really look to what the cash flows look like over the life. And clearly, if there's an opportunity over the life to sell them and to maximize value at some point between now and that maturity, we would do it. But that's really -- when we went into it that was how we looked at it. And by the way, with that said, it's why -- we're not big on recasting our numbers, but we think it's important to look at the Rialto earnings machine without the PPIP either contribution or detraction because it's a clearer picture of what's really happening in Rialto.","Operator","The next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. So you mentioned that the affordability decision has been kind of driving the new home purchases lately. And where have you seen this come through in terms of your product line? And I guess really what we're trying to get at is have you seen the kind of less seasonal first-time buyer come back? And is that what kind of helped you put up a very pretty solid order number this quarter?","Bruce E. Gross","It's really been across the entire universe of the product line. We've seen increased traffic at the entry-level, first-time buyer. We've seen a pick up clearly in that mid-market, and some of our higher-end product has been performing pretty well. Stuart talked a little bit earlier about this value proposition change between the rental world and the for-sale world, and we've seen some evidence that is beyond the surveys. In our traditional marketing approaches, we do eBlaster emails targeted at the rental world with door flyers. And when we do that, we see traffic coming because people are understanding that the overall ownership equation versus the rental equation pencils out. So it's really across the price for a second.","Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, yes, on some of your kind of interesting marketing initiatives, we noticed on your website that you have a section that is devoted entirely to people who've been through a foreclosure before. I mean, are you seeing a meaningful amount of traffic from this group? And I would assume it's probably a little too early for that group to start buying, but yes, I mean how much of the traffic comes from this area?","Stuart A. Miller","You really have 3 different types of people. You have people who have gone through the short sale process. They are generally taken out of the market for 2 years. You have people that have gone through a foreclosure. They are generally taken out of the market for 3 years. And then you have people who have gone through a bankruptcy, and they're taken out of the market for generally 6 or 7 years. Is it 6 or 7, Jon?","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Seven.","Stuart A. Miller","Seven. Okay. So you have a sizable group of people across the country that have gone through a short sale process or foreclosure that are starting to come around the corner and reenter the market. And even if they're not actually in the market or the time hasn't quite lapsed, they are preparing to look at getting back in the market. They are preparing their credit and their down payment because they don't want to be vulnerable to the 12-month repricing that you get in the rental world. And that is what we're seeing out there, and they are active participants.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","Just for clarity, this is Jon, that site and our social media effort focuses on renters who also didn't go through that distress but either made the active choice to rent for a period of time or just have credit issues that don't necessarily derive out of the short sale or foreclosure but just have to deal with their particular debt situation, or the situation just needing to save for down payments. So we're trying to communicate and reach out in an effective way to people who are interested in homeownership, and we help and guide them how to get there.","Operator","The next question is coming from Bob Wetenhall of RBC.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Your ASPs are up $5,000 and your incentives are up only $200 year-over-year. This is obviously a very favorable trend, and I just wanted to see if you think this trend is expected to accelerate as you move into the spring selling season.","Bruce E. Gross","As we said, we're really managing towards a net price depending on the product, the division, the market, the community. Each one of these -- each one of our homes are incentivized to sell in order to maximize margin. We gave a little bit of color with regard to what our go-forward margin expectations in there. To some degree, our price expectations on sales prices are reflected in that increased range.","Jonathan M. Jaffe","This is Jon. As Stuart said earlier, I think we're going to have to wait and see what the trend delivers to us and how sales volume materializes. If we do see increased absorptions, we would expect that trend to continue. But if we see a leveling off, then you'd expect flatness. And that really is a result of that level of activity.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Understood. Just turning to your SG&A spending, I think you were at $120 million in 2009 and then subsequently, you've brought that under $100 million in each of the last 2 years. Given your expectations for stronger volumes, are you still going to be able to keep SG&A close to $100 million next year? Or do you expect that's going to go back towards the $120 million number?","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Well, it depends on the volume that we're going to see. So you're talking about the SG&A line, it's really dependent on the volume, Bob, that we're going to accomplish and how many new communities that we're going to be opening up.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And if I could sneak one in, would it be reasonable to look for Rialto to, given the attractive backlog you have, to contribute somewhere north of $50 million next year? Is that a reasonable number to use? Trying to understand how much visibility you guys have into that.","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","Yes. We haven't given any numbers. You note the last 2 quarters, if you strip out the PPIP, we're around $15 million. But we haven't given any projections because the timing of some of the sales and collections from the borrowers doesn't necessarily come in where you could schedule it perfectly. So we'll have to wait and see. We haven't actually given a number out yet, Bob.","Stuart A. Miller","And with that said, I don't want to diminish the fact that we are seeing -- and I think that we've highlighted for you that we're starting to see real strength in earnings from the Rialto machine. And we look forward to good performance as we go forward.","Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But at the bare minimum, this -- the trends you're seeing now with Rialto, it looks like it's sustainable into next year.","Jeffrey P. Krasnoff","We're enthusiastic about Rialto's prospects as we move ahead.","Operator","The next question is coming from Dan Oppenheim, Credit Suisse.","Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wondering, when you're talking about the market and such, you're talking about a lot of buyers that have worked through foreclosures. How do you -- as you look ahead, how do you think about that in terms of a lot of foreclosures that have yet to come to market and stuck in the process? Do you have any worries about that, especially in Florida where it's been a pretty gradual process there? How are you thinking about?","Stuart A. Miller","Well as I've noted, the foreclosure world, when looked at in a somewhat broader perspective, gets clouded by good markets, the best markets, good markets and not such good markets. And in the markets where we are targeting and where we are making our purchases, and I think Rick did a good job of highlighting our strategy that is decidedly away from areas where there are foreclosures to be had, our markets are generally focused on areas where the foreclosure and even the delinquency backlog had basically been absorbed because they are the more desirable areas to be purchasing. And so even where -- you might think that foreclosures have not yet been completely resolved. In order for a home to get to a foreclosure, it's got to either not be salable at a price that can be realized or properly pay off the mortgage, or at a price where a bank won't accept the short sale. In the more desirable areas, short sales are taking place to -- as an intervention method before you get to a foreclosure. So in those markets, you've seen a lot of clearing, and we think the overhang is not nearly as severe. ","Okay. Well, we appreciate everybody's attention on our 2011 review. We look forward to giving you more color as we go forward into 2012. Thanks for your attention.","Operator","This would conclude today's conference.

This morning, I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from; and Dianne Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto, are here as well, as well as some other members of our management team. Some of them will be joining in on our conversation during the Q&A period.","I'm going to briefly give some remarks, as I've always done, about the business in general, and then Bruce is going to jump in, break down our financial detail and give some further guidance for next year, and then as always, we will open up to Q&A.","We would like to request, as we always do, that during the Q&A period each of our participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can get as many participants as possible.","So let me go ahead and begin and say that our second quarter 2016 results reflect another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We've continued to benefit from a slow and steady housing market recovery that has continued to define the US housing market environment, and we've crafted specific strategies within our company for our business that have positioned us well to maximize the opportunity in these market conditions.","As we've noted consistently over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years.","While questions have been raised as to the real, normalized levels of production that are required to serve the US current population, we believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing.","While measuring current production levels against historical norms of 1.5 million starts per year might be flawed logic, as there may be a new normal, we believe that the very low inventory levels in existing and new homes and the low vacancy rates and high and growing rental rates for apartments indicate that we are in short supply nationally.","With that said, it's important to note that the housing market is not really a national market. Instead, it's a large number of very local markets, each with different dynamics that are averaged together to generate some sometimes quirky results.","With that said, we believe that there continues to be a growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady market improvement.","While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic conditions including lower unemployment, modest wage growth, and general consumer confidence are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments.","We expect that demand will continue to build and come to the market over the next years and that will drive increased production as the deficit and housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished.","Nevertheless, land and labor shortages will continue to be limiting factors and will constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, while the mortgage market and higher rents will continue to constrain that demand.","We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow and steady positive homebuilding market and will enable slow, steady though sometimes erratic growth throughout the industry.","This has been our consistent guiding theme over the past years, and we have mapped our strategy around this view. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of these segments. Even with the somewhat erratic conditions that defined the early part of this year, we have remained resolute in our view that have generated our strategies.","Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for sale homebuilding operations experienced a healthy spring selling season with a sales pace of 3.9 sales per month per community.","Our results reflect the slow but steady growth in the overall homebuilding market as our new home orders increased 10% year-over-year, while community count grew 4%, and our average sales price grew 4% to $362,000.","Even while continued labor shortages, and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has carefully managed sales prices, maximized margins, and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.9%.","As we've noted in past conference calls, we have adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has adjusted to that recovery. There are three components of our core homebuilding segment strategy. They are soft pivot, slower growth, and focus on SG&A.","To begin, we've talked consistently about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years, away from the land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery, and we are now targeting land acquisitions with a shorter, two to three year average life.","Our more recent quarterly reports have demonstrated that we've moderated our land spend as a percent of homebuilding revenues, and this has and will continue to be a core strategy driving our homebuilding platform as we manage land acquisitions to taper the growth rate in both community count and home sales.","Second, we've noted in past quarter conference calls that given our now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in order to grow the bottom line and to drive strong cash flow.","We have moderated our top line growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin.","Third, with less pressure on the top line growth rate, we can intensify management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra of What We Can Measure, We Can Change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operation.","As an example, last quarter, we highlighted that we've been working on reducing customer acquisition costs. We've been moving our advertising and marketing spend away from conventional marketing, like newspaper and billboard advertising, to a purely digital platform.","In the current quarter\u2019s results, we're continuing to see the benefit of this management focus as a significant portion of our SG&A reduction can be attributed to this initiative. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest second quarter SG&A in our company's history.","With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight, and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our three-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for the slow but steady growth environment.","We feel that we can run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate, with strong bottom line profitability and cash flow by measuring and changing our way to greater efficiency and performance in our core for sale homebuilding segment.","Moving on, our financial services group has had an outstanding second quarter as well. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong though sometimes erratic refi market, as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. These side car opportunities are continuing to expand as we move through 2016.","Our strategy for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to continue to construct and maintain a fully self sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.","Next, our multi-family program continues to develop as a leading blue chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The second quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to complement our for sale homebuilding operations.","Since household formation has recovered as a slower rate than expected and many new households have been more inclined to rent than purchase, we have focused on building well-located rental communities to address this market opportunity.","First time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While approximately 30% of our for sale homebuilding business continues to be geared to first-time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well.","As we've continued to expand our national footprint, we've matured and evolved from a merchant build program which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase worked extremely well, as we have proven our ability to purchase, design, build, stabilize and sell a number of our communities at a growing level of profitability.","Having proven the concept, we have now built or added a build to core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have now raised $2 billion for our build-to-core platform which will become a long term cash flow producing, fee generating, value creation machine.","And while multifamily production has generally normalized, more rental product is going to continue to be needed and we are very well positioned to continue to be careful in site selection while we fill this need and grow our multifamily platform. Our now almost $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well-timed as rental rates continue to climb and vacancies are at very low levels.","Next, our Rialto segment continued to see challenges of the second quarter. While our Rialto segment continued to see challenges in the second quarter, we continued to see opportunity rising in our Asset Management business, as we get closer to realizing the embedded value of our promote from our Rialto fund investments.","We expect to begin to report our promote in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our Fund and Asset Management business showed improved profitability over last year's second quarter and we expect this trend to continue.","Unfortunately, volatility within the capital markets in the first quarter continued to pressure volumes and pricing on new issue commercial mortgage-backed securities into the second quarter and that continued to negatively impact our mortgage finance business.","Nevertheless, while Rialto Mortgage Finance was less of a contributor in the current period than in past quarters, we have been seeing sequential improvements in both volumes and margins for RMF and the capital markets have generally healed and we expect improvement in contributions in the second half of the year.","Rialto also suffered a one-time write-off, resulting from a discrete single asset from a bulk legacy acquisition in 2010. Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycles.","While the collapse of the capital markets in the beginning of the calendar year and the one-time write-off from a single asset negatively impacted year-to-date earnings for Rialto, this volatility has also created unique opportunities for new investments in our Asset Management business.","The dysfunction in the financial markets along with new risk retention rules and banking regulations will ultimately work to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in CMBS and financial products and we will continue to grow as a best-in-class asset manager.","Finally, as we noted in our press release, we've successfully completed an important step in the evolution of FivePoint, our strategic large-scale community builder. We contributed and exchanged our interest in three strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in a newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings, LLC.","This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint's evolution as a strategic developer and manager of large scale master plan communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar's strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base.","As the recovery matures, FivePoint will operate very independently with a self contained management, led by Emile Haddad. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future of this one of a kind leader in community development.","Overall and in conclusion, let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our second quarter results and our overall progress this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that define our business segments have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth.","And as I've said many times before, we are extremely confident that we have the right people, the right programs, and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future.","Now let me turn it over to Bruce.","Bruce Gross","Thanks, Stuart. And good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $218 million, which is a 19% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the second quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly-owned deliveries, and a 4% year-over-year increase in average selling price to 362,000.","Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 23.1%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 23.8%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs. Sales incentives continued to decline as this quarter was 5.7% versus 5.8% in the prior year.","Gross margin percents were once again, highest in the east and west regions. Direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot, driven entirely by labor and offset by a slight decrease in material costs.","As Stuart highlighted, we were successful in improving our SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and we continued to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. As a result, operating margins improved year over year by 10 basis points.","Equity and loss from unconsolidated subs was $9.6 million in the second quarter compared to equity in the earnings of $6.5 million in the prior year. The loss was primarily attributable to the company's share of costs associated with establishing the new FivePoint entity, partially offset by $6.7 million of equity in earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities, primarily due to the sale of home sites to third parties.","Other income was $14.9 million, primarily due to a profit participation from one of our joint ventures and there is a partial offset of $7 million in the non-controlling interest line.","We opened 88 new communities to end the quarter with 692 net active communities. New home orders increased 10% and new order dollar value increased 11% for the quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 14% in the second quarter from 15% in the prior year.","In the second quarter, we purchased 5,300 home sites, totaling $437 million versus $445 million in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with our soft pivot strategy, where we are focused on buying shorter duration land.","Our home sites owned and controlled now total 166,000 home sites, of which 131,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,200 homes, which is in our normal range of 1 to 2 per community.","Turning to financial services, this business segment had strong results this quarter, with operating earnings of $44.1 million compared to $39.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.8 million from $33.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were flat with the prior year at $2.4 billion.","The improved earnings is driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment. Refinance volume for the company decreased to 12% of total originations from 19% in the prior year, bringing this quarter's purchase origination volume to 88% of total originations.","The capture rate of Lennar home buyers improved to 83% this quarter from 82% in the prior year. Our title companies' profit also increased growing to $7.4 million in the quarter from $5.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher profit per transaction versus prior year.","Turning to Rialto, this segment produced an operating loss of $13.8 million compared to operating earnings of $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interest.","The Investment Management business contributed $26.1 million of earnings, which includes $6.9 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds, and $19.2 million of management fees and other.","At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals $138 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $386 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $12.7 million, compared with $721 million and $29 million in the prior year respectively, and these are before their G&A expenses.","As mentioned previously, the volume decrease was due to the disruption in the CMBS capital markets earlier this year and it has taken some time for the new loan market to ramp back up.","Our direct investments had a loss of $21 million, this included a $16 million write-off of uncollectible receivables at a hospital acquired through the foreclosure of the distressed loan from a 2010 bank portfolio acquisition. A third-party management company operates this hospital.","Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $24.9 million for the quarter and interest expense was $6.7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $104 million of cash.","The multifamily segment delivered a $14.9 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $15.4 million share of the gain from the sale of an operating property and a $5.2 million gain on a third-party land sale, as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses.","We ended the quarter with 8 completed and operating properties, and 32 under construction, 5 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 9,700 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $2.6 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion and over 25,000 apartments.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. The lower rate is a result of our continuing efforts to maximize the new Home Energy Efficiency Credit, which was again extended into 2016. The tax rate for future quarters should be approximately 34%, although we will continue to focus on trying to maximize this available energy credit.","Turning to the balance sheet. Liquidity remains strong with approximately $600 million of homebuilding cash and $375 million of borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility.","Our leverage improved by 390 basis points year over year, as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 43.5%. We grew stockholders' equity by 19% to $6.1 billion and our book value per share increased to $27.92 per share. In March, we issued $500 million of five-year senior notes at 4.75%, and in April, we retired our maturing 6.5% senior notes.","In May, we converted the remaining $71 million of our 2.75% convertible notes. And in addition, during the quarter, we early converted approximately $68 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes, with an additional $136 million converted subsequent to quarter end.","Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. 2016 homebuilding goals are right on track with the guidance that we gave at the start of the year, with just a couple of quarterly refinements.","First, deliveries. Deliveries are still on track to be between 26,500 and 27,000 homes for all of 2016. The backlog conversion ratio in the second quarter was 88%, which exceeded the previous guidance of 80% to 85%.","We capitalized on a healthy spring selling season, and sold and delivered some homes in Q2 that were scheduled for our third quarter. Given that, we now expect our backlog conversion ratio to be around 75% in the third quarter. The fourth quarter is still projected to achieve a backlog conversion of at least 90%.","Operating margins are still on track to be flat to down 50 basis points for the entire year. The gross margin percent will vary between Q3 and Q4 based on our product mix. Q3 is expected to be between 22.5% and 23%, while the fourth quarter is projected to be between 23.5% and 24%. We are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A in our company's history for the full year with the greatest leverage coming in our fourth quarter.","Turning to financial services, we are assuming we will continue to benefit from the extended low interest rate environment and we are increasing our financial services goal to $130 million to $135 million of profit for all of 2016.","Turning to Rialto, we are still on track to earn between $15 million and $20 million for 2016. However, the one-time write-off of the hospital receivables will now bring the range to flat to $5 million of profit for the full year and is still weighted more heavily towards the fourth quarter.","We are still on track with $50 million to $55 million of profit in the multifamily segment, with the third quarter close to breakeven and strong profits in the fourth quarter.","The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income we expect to be flattish for the third quarter, but now expect the fourth quarter to be the highest profit quarter for this category in 2016, with $20 million to $30 million of profit.","And finally, our balance sheet is well on its way on its path to lower leverage. The soft pivot strategy, the strong earnings contribution, and the $400 million 3.25% convertible security of which half is already converted through mid-June, should bring us to a net debt to total capital in the 35% to 40% range by year end. This will position us extremely well as we finish out 2016.","Let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Speakers, our first question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Your line now is open.","Ivy Zelman","Thank you. Good morning and congratulations, guys. Great quarter.","Stuart Miller","Morning.","Ivy Zelman","Stuart or I'm not sure if Rick or Jon are on, but maybe you guys can just give us some perspective on looking at the results fundamentally within the company's framework, the ones that kind of came in lower than you might have expected on sales and where you are exceeding.","And differentiating between price point because there is some concern around moderation at the high end whereas the lower price point seems to be very much accelerating, so that's my first. And then I have a follow up? Thank you.","Stuart Miller","Okay, good. I'm going to turn it over to Rick and Jon, but I want to correct one thing that I apparently said. Jon is not the Chief Financial Officer of the company. He is the Chief Operating Officer, and I didn't want to dethrone Bruce inadvertently, so let me turn it over to Jon and Rick to give some color on that.","Jon Jaffe","Ivy, its Jon. Overall, we saw strong sales in different markets that tend to cover both starter price points and move up price points. For example, specifically, Northwest was strong across all segments.","Southern California was strong, Southeast and Southwest Florida were strong, Charlotte and the Carolinas also strong, and Central Valley, which is a more affordable price point for California.","The place that was off the most was Houston. As you would expect, as we continue to see the effects of job loss there, and you see that also with our greatest increase in incentives in Houston, even though for the overall company, we're flat.","So if you look at it in big picture, Florida was year-over-year sort of flat for us in absorption pace, California flat, Texas, excluding Houston, was actually improved nicely, and the Carolinas were improved. And clearly we do see some lower demand in the higher price points as compared to lower price points, but generally it's still submarket driven.","Ivy Zelman","Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just secondly, on the respect to the multifamily portfolio and recognizing the strength of what you're seeing, can you talk a little bit about the lease-ups, if they're meeting expectations.","There is concern that we've all been talking about on the urban supply and a lot of supply that might be a bit ahead of its skis and how you think about your investment and your growth in that sector in that overall category going forward with respect to the supply dynamics?","Rick Beckwitt","Hi, Ivy. It's Rick. First, I would tell you that we couldn't be, from our standpoint better positioned. You've got to go back in time. We started this program back in 2011 and a lot of the pipeline was secured at points in time where there wasn't a lot of people looking for a land opportunity, and it's coming through our machine right now.","We've got key strategies, the merchant built strategy where we're going to sell those assets and generate good and consistent profits for us as a company. And our build-to-core strategy gives us the opportunity to hold on to these assets for a longer period of time because it's in a longer growth vehicle.","As you look at the things that we've put under contract, we were very careful in first of all, understanding where the growth in the market was going to be, focusing on vacancy levels, focusing on age of product that was close to our assets.","So just like in our homebuilding business, we were very specific on identifying where things were going to come on and compete. And I can tell you, looking across the portfolio we really couldn't be better positioned right now.","Stuart Miller","Let me jump in here, Ivy, and say that, you know, I think that we had at the outset, a strategic advantage. We started with an overlay of homebuilding operations where we had market data and market intelligence.","We understood that we were not dealing with a national apartment market or for sale market for that matter, but we were dealing with local markets and each one would have to be regarded carefully and individually.","We mapped out our strategy for investment for land acquisition. We were careful to avoid markets that looked like they were becoming oversaturated. I think Rick and Jon and the entire multifamily team did an extraordinary job of finding the opportunities where growth would be consistent and where we would have long dated opportunities for a sustained business.","And given the fact that we had a very deep research team already established that had an eye towards not just the rental markets but also the for-sale markets, we think gave us a better window into the market and better strategic positioning.","There is a lot of talk about the urban markets being somewhat overbuilt in most of those instances. Those were the markets where we saw the most action and where we didn't get heavily involved or where we did, we got involved very early at very attractive pricing. ","So I think that we are starting to hear - everybody is starting to hear that there might be a little bit more heat in some of the rental markets. What I've heard articulated by one of the best and brightest in the rental market is that we're probably coming to the later innings of a double header, the first game of a double header.","We might see a little bit of softness for a period of time but it looks like and it feels like absorption is going to outstrip any kind of oversupply in fairly short order and we think that there's a lot of run rate for the multifamily markets, for the rental markets going forward.","Rick Beckwitt","And Ivy, just a last thing on that. If we are in that stage where the market gets a little bit soft and that - what that's going to do is it's going to drive some of the people out of the market and given the fact that we just created this $2 billion venture, it's going to position us to really capitalize on the opportunity as people step away from the market. So we're really excited about where we are.","Ivy Zelman","Well, good luck. Thanks guys.","Stuart Miller","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Sir, you line now is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I had was on the, just another type of broader health question on the general markets. Ivy referred to kind of the higher end, but I was hoping to get a little bit more color around what's going on in your California markets and kind of speak to coastal versus inland empire, and you mentioned Central Valley.","If we could kind of get a little more in depth look on different trends, different markets and again, maybe speaking to high end versus low end and the foreign buyer, there's always, I think, a good amount of interest in those trends.","Jon Jaffe","Sure, this is Jon again. California, as I said a moment ago, from a sales pace perspective, has remained strong year over year. We see a pace of over five sales per community per month on average. Certainly at the lower price point, it absorbs faster.","California, in general though, it's hard to produce homes at the lower price points because not only of land costs but also because of impact fees being as significant as they are. And so that tends to drive particularly, in Southern California, the Bay Area, a higher sales point. And at that higher sales price point, clearly, it's hard to get significant momentum above, I think, the current levels.","We are seeing a sustained interest, particularly in the Asian or Chinese buyer. We haven't seen that fall off. So if you look at a place like Irvine, where it's been very significant. We have good data at the Great Park. That's remains very consistent and healthy, same thing in the Bay Area marketplace, so we're seeing consistency there.","Bakersfield, probably, is off the most in terms of California markets, it's similar to Houston. It's not as severe to us that was hurt by the pullback in the energy sector which is a lot of the job creation so there's been in Bakersfield, so there's job loss in Bakersfield. Fresno remains healthy, though, from a Central Valley perspective.","Michael Rehaut","Great, Jon. That was really helpful. I appreciate that. And then just secondly, on the second half of the year, obviously, a lot of detailed guidance and really appreciate the help there, but no good deed goes unturned, unpunished so just a little more clarity, if possible.","The ASP for the back half of the year, you did 365 in the first quarter, 362 in the second, your average price in backlog is in the high 360. So can we expect something similar to persist into the back half?","Bruce Gross","Mike, this is Bruce. I would say that because the mix of what's in the backlog includes a little bit more of lower priced homes, you are likely to see the average sales price come down into the 350s in the back half of the year.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Bruce Gross","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Susan McClary of UBS. Your line now is open.","Susan McClary","Thank you. Good morning.","Rick Beckwitt","Good morning.","Susan McClary","You obviously have realized a lot of benefits in what you've been doing through your marketing initiatives in the SG&A that we this quarter but looking out from there, how do we think about what the next steps are and what other things could you take advantage of to continue to see improvements in there?","Stuart Miller","Well, the example of migrating from conventional to digital marketing is put forth, simply, as an example. We have initiatives throughout our organization that are designed to use technologies to change the landscape of the way that we're operating our business.","Some other examples of that are as simple as in and around technology. We are revamping the entire plumbing system of our technology department to reconfigure in a more efficient manner in the way we input information and ultimately, produce reports for people in the field.","That seems kind of simplistic but in a company like ours that has evolved systems over a lot of years, going back and reconfiguring systems with a proper tubing system enables us to reduce the number of applications that we're actually using in the field with multiple points of input to drive efficient export of data to the people that need to use it on a regular basis. It will enable us to be more accurate. It will enable us to be a lot more timely, approaching real time distribution of data over the next year or two.","This will - that initiative alone will drive costs down. We view that over the next couple of years, there's a 20 basis point to 50 basis point reduction in SG&A that we'll derive just from that.","Now, there might be some intermittent ticks up in cost but primarily, the trend will be down. In our production arena, we are using our technologies to look at the number of models and the efficiency of the plan designs that we're offering our customers in the field.","We're looking at technologies to review and to consolidate the view of SKUs that we're offering across our different markets. All of these things we view as opportunities to bring another 10, 20, 50 basis points to either the reduction of SG&A or potentially, the efficiency of our construction efforts.","Susan McClary","Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful and then just in terms of the labor side I know that you noted your costs were around about 2%, I think, you said in the quarter. We are hearing that in some areas, perhaps things are getting a bit better there. Can you just give us more detail on what you mean?","Jon Jaffe","This is Jon. I wouldn't describe conditions as better. What you see is a change as the construction cycle moves into this part of the year, so you see more stress, perhaps in the drywall area today than you did before, and perhaps less stress at the front end, with flats but overall, it remains very constrained.","All of the increase for us was in the labor category. In fact, because of the low point of lumber in our deliveries in Q2, actually, material costs were down for us year over year.","So still can see pressure in labor and it ties into the point Stuart was making, where we're very focused on doing a better job of our tools communicating with our labor force. So that we could communicate job site readiness and their availability and be better connected with our trade partners.","Susan McClary","Okay. Thank you.","Stuart Miller","Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line now is open.","Michael Eisen","Good morning. This is actually Michael Eisen on for Rob today. Just a quick question for you guys. Looking at some of the trends that I'm seeing quarter-over-quarter on your orders and demand, I was wondering if any of the strength in the central market or slowdown in the west and some other regions is due to a change in community count and footprint as opposed to just organic demand.","If you guys could touch on some of the markets that have been outliers for you of either strength or weaknesses, greatly appreciate it?","Jon Jaffe","Well, this is Jon. Again the biggest needle mover was the decline in sales pace in Houston, when you look at the Central. Other markets in the Central, saw an improvement in Phoenix and Dallas has remained very strong and improved year over year in terms of sales pace and the West fluctuates very much based on community openings.","So for example, the Bay Area, which remains very strong was down year over year, and that's just based on timing. We went from an absorption of over seven sales per month per community to five.","Five is very healthy, but I would just say that's just dependent on timing of communities and very similar throughout the rest of California.","Michael Eisen","So thinking about timing for the remainder of the year, would you expect those trends in California to persist or will additional communities come on to market that will help benefit those rates in the region?","Jon Jaffe","I think, in general, you see as municipalities struggle to deal with the increase in activity, a slowness in bringing communities online so I think you'd expect that trend to continue somewhat.","Michael Eisen","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Jon Jaffe","And if you look at Central activity, our sales were up 22% year-over-year for the quarter. We've got some communities that were held back because of weather. It was really wet in parts of the Central US. And so you'll start to see those come on end of this quarter, beginning of next.","Michael Eisen","Very helpful. Thank you guys.","Rick Beckwitt","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of John Lovallo of Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line now is open.","John Lovallo","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my call as well. The first question is on the operating margin outlook to be flat to down 50 basis points year over years. This is despite 20 basis points of improvement in the first quarter and about 10 basis points in the second quarter.","I understand that the third quarter gross margin expectations seem to be a bit tempered but it just seems that the leverage that you should get on the higher volume in the back half of the year could be an offset so it just feels like there might be a little conservatism baked in there, can you help me understand that?","Bruce Gross","Yes, John. This is Bruce. As you look at the prior year, we had some pretty strong operating margins, especially in the third quarter as you're looking at year over year and then the fourth quarter.","So as you are looking at any change in volume, our third quarter won't have as much increase in volume as our fourth quarter is likely to have year over year, so there's not much leverage there. So we are not trying to be conservative.","I think as we've laid out this guidance and updated it from quarter to quarter, this is what we really think is going to come in, so as you do the math with those numbers, I think you'll see us right in that range. There's no conservatism that we're trying to put into the guidance that were given.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thank you, and then the follow-up would be realizing that Houston has still been a challenging market with oil kind of creeping back in that $50 per barrel range, how has the mood been? Are you guys seeing signs that things could be at least, bottoming?","Stuart Miller","Yes, we are seeing signs of that. The biggest issue associated with Houston right now is you're still seeing positive employment growth. The issue is that, that growth is really happening at the lower wage jobs as opposed to the higher wage jobs.","Driving that or stemming from that, our lower-priced homes and we have a lot of communities in Houston that are focused on the lower price, are doing extremely well. It's really once you get above that $400,000 price point in the oil corridor, where sales are off and if you were to break out our business between our higher price and our lower price, what's dragging Houston down is the higher price communities.","That being said, we've got some core assets that are lowland bases that we are just hanging on and metering out so sales to the buyers that are there.","We are seeing in rig counts slow - decline, the decline in rig counts slow down. You're starting to see a little bit more relo activity or talk of relo activity as oil inches back up. As it moves above 50, 55, I think you'll start to see an overall change in temperament throughout the market.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Stuart Miller","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani of KBW. Your line now is open.","Jade Rahmani","Thanks for taking my questions. Just a broad strategic question as the Lennar family of companies has expanded. Is there vision for the company to evolve into more of a real estate asset manager, Brookfield type of company or do you see the Company remaining, at its core, a home builder with other but perhaps, fewer related offshoot businesses that you mentioned with FivePoint, the potential for simplification?","Stuart Miller","Yes, our strategy and we've been talking about it for some time now, is with the maturity of the market, we're clearly focused on reverting to our core of what we almost call reverting to pure play.","We think that the development of some of these strategic ancillary businesses were very much a part of growing the core out of the downturn and leveraging opportunities that were part of our DNA.","But having developed those strategies to elements of maturity, we think that there are opportunities that we have maintained as optional opportunities for those businesses to find better programs for themselves. You see that embedded in the way that FivePoint has been evolving.","If you look at the management team of FivePoint, led by Emile Haddad, who we have been working - he's been working within the company for over 20 years. The management team is a self-sufficient, independent, highly confident, industry leading management team that's prepared to operate very independently. And as has been reported, we have been looking at an opportune time to invigorate an IPO.","The market doesn't happen to be there but with that said, it's emblematic of the strategies that we've employed. Jeff Krasnoff leads Rialto. Rialto has its self-sufficient team. And of course, as we've talked about quite a lot on this call, our Multifamily Program, LMC, is also led by Todd Farrell, very strong leader with a core management team that it, too, is operating very independently.","So while under the Lennar umbrella, we all tend to thrive and work well together and synergistically, the core mission right now is to revert to pure play as a home builder and to, ultimately, over the next years, as opportunities present themselves, find proper homes for those opportunities.","Jade Rahmani","And on the Rialto side, with risk retention quickly approaching on the horizon for the end of this year, are you viewing that as an opportunity and specifically, is there an opportunity to raise funds that would be - are you seeing demand from institutional investors to participate in risk retention funds?","Stuart Miller","Well, look, we've talked about that a number of times and look, Rialto has some of its legacy assets that came about in the beginnings of the recovery are a minor drag to an operation but the big bold opportunity is this blue-chip operating machine that we have built as an asset manager and as a conduit business.","That business is really well-crafted to participate in this ultra-regulatory environment that we have run into, where both bank regulation, whether it's Basel III or Dodd-Frank and risk retention rules all kind of migrate business in the direction of the platform that we've built.","And over time, Rialto was going to benefit from these things, is well-positioned. The money that we have raised is clearly earmarked for those kinds of things, and it convinces a real confidence in the opportunity set that lies ahead.","Jade Rahmani","Thanks very much.","Stuart Miller","You're welcome. Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line now is open.","Mike Dahl","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First question, just to pick up on some of those FivePoint comments. Just maybe some clarification there. I think the original intent was that this formal combination was conditioned on an actual IPO. So just curious if the overall structure is the same.","Your ownership interest is the same as originally contemplated. What's the rationale for going ahead and formerly converting the interests today and then it looked like you recognized some costs alongside that this quarter. So how should we think about any P&L impact over the next couple of quarters related to this?","Stuart Miller","I think in a general sense, the transaction is very similar. As is widely known, the IPO market has been tepid, at best. It's just not the opportune time but the strategy of putting together FivePoint and large-scale communities under one umbrella management team was a strategy that was primary under any circumstances. The contribution that we made basically had a very similar net impact and might be some nuanced differences.","And in terms of FivePoint's profitability going forward, I think you'll look to the numbers that come out from FivePoint independently, as it has asserted itself as an independent entity, very much part of our construct.","So I think that what you're seeing is very similar to what we articulated as part of an IPO process but just not with the fruition of the IPO process. And the combination that we've engineered in anticipation of something in the future is about creating efficiencies and effectiveness and growing this large-scale blue chip operating platform for large-scale community development.","Mike Dahl","Okay. Thanks for that, Stuart. And then second question, just going back to some of the margin guidance and so I understand the operating margin is flat to down 50 basis points. If I look at the gross margin guidance specifically and look at midpoints and combine with some of the backlog conversion numbers, it looks like the guide is effectively towards the lower end of the 23 to 24 for gross margins. And again, I understand there's some offsets on the better SG&A control.","But just curious, what are - what's driving that difference in - or driving you towards the lower end of the gross margin guide compared to three or six months ago?","Stuart Miller","Well, look, I think that what we've articulated is a slow and steady growth recovery environment that has defined housing but a lot of choppiness along the way. And I guess if there's a representation of the choppiness we're talking about, it's the way that the first quarter evolved, kind of as a surprise to everyone.","Fed raised interest rates, starting January 1 right out of the chutes at the beginning of the year, the capital markets tanked and it created some lack of confidence in the consumer. I think generally speaking, you can't time where the choppiness actually exists. And so we left a fairly wide range as we gave guidance at the beginning of the year.","We're probably trending to the lower parts of that range but I think it derives from the choppiness that's embedded in the system and the way that the years started out. And so at the end of the day, I think this is well within kind of the range that we've articulated.","I don't think it should be of any concern that we're trending towards the lower part of that range. In fact, it's exactly why we gave the range that we did, recognizing that there's some tugs and pulls to the downside as well as the upside. But we still believe very strongly that the trend is upward.","Mike Dahl","Great. And is this, I guess if we're looking out to next quarter, is this something where this is just a lack of pricing power that you would have anticipated or will we actually see incentives tick up in what's delivered over the next two quarters?","Rick Beckwitt","I think it's a - this is Rick. It's a combination of several factors, choppiness, as Stuart said. We are seeing some labor price increases out in the field and that's flowing through our product.","Certainly, the building material manufacturers are trying to get more for their product as well. That, combined with a slowing of sales price increases, has caused our margins to compress a little bit.","As you step back from that, I'd say that there's still very healthy margins. We're very much focused on operating margin and if we can get some incremental deliveries, you'll see the play on operating margin and that's really how we're operating the company.","We are - we continue to benefit from some land assets that we bought in prior years, but when we're replacing those land assets and a little bit higher land cost basis running through so it's a combination of all those things that has an impact on gross margin.","Stuart Miller","Let me just, in this context, remind one thing that I said in the early - in my initial remarks and that is, we tend to look at national numbers, even the roll up of Lennar's numbers are a national roll-up across the country. We're actually dealing with a lot of very, very different markets that roll up and sometimes give some kind of quirky roll up results.","And so each market is operating very independently, is finding that the volatility in its unique market can sometimes relate to jobs, can sometimes relate to macro environment, can sometimes relate to the international environment.","So you are seeing a roll up of all of those trends. So let's not forget that these are a lot of local markets that are operating very independently.","Mike Dahl","Right. Always a good reminder and thanks for the color.","Rick Beckwitt","You bet. Let's take the last question.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from the line of Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open.","Tim Daley","Thanks for taking my call. This is actually Tim Daley on for Nishu.","Stuart Miller","Okay. Good morning.","Tim Daley","My first question is kind of touching back with what Ivy was discussing in the multi-family business. So I noticed that you mentioned that you kind of started the multi-family business by gathering market data and the marketing intelligence that you had via the single family operations.","Does that mean you're traditionally targeting the same markets in multifamily as currently operating out of single family? And how does this dynamic interact if that's the case?","Stuart Miller","No, I wouldn't think of it exactly that way. Although, that is - we are all targeting the same basic buyer. It just kind of depends on what the appetite of the buyer is at a moment in time.","But I think that what we were articulating is that our keen understanding of each local market gave us an advantage as a new entrant to understanding where the demand actually lay and what the opportunity set was.","It also gave us a very sensitive group of tentacles in the market as to where activity was evolving. So it enabled us to avoid the markets that were perhaps getting a little bit too hot while gearing towards the markets that had the most, the deepest set of opportunities.","So I would say that the multifamily group has interacted very symbiotically with the for sale group and it's really worked to our benefit in developing a long-term strategy.","Rick Beckwitt","Let me just add a little more color on that. If you look at the first time buyer, they are generally focused on, because of affordability, suburban type opportunities that require a little bit longer commute for them to get to where their work center is.","In our multifamily operation, what we focused on is very transit-oriented locations, suburban-urban, a little bit urban, very location specific for folks that can't or may choose not to buy, but want to rent and they want to be in a live, work, play type of environment so we've really got two discrete strategies going on right now to capture that person that's in that first-time buyer world.","Tim Daley","Understood. Great. And then just a follow-up on that, if you do just obviously a little higher level, but if you overlap in some of these markets, which I assume you kind of do, how do you see the ability to price rent versus the ability to price the single family to buy homes?","Stuart Miller","Well, look, let's remember that we are always competing as a for sale home builder against the rental markets and perhaps more importantly, against the existing home markets.","So we've been pricing against rental rates for decades and the fact that we happen to be producing some of those rental communities in our markets is incidental. The fact is in none of our markets are we a dominant factor.","To the contrary, we might have a community or two in any of the markets in which we operate in and our homebuilding operation and pricing per se operates very independently from the way that we're pricing rental rates.","I would say to steer clear of viewing those two - any kind of relationship in rental rates and for sale pricing as interdependent as it relates to our management team pricing either one.","Tim Daley","All right. Great. Thank you for the color.","Stuart Miller","Okay, great. Well, listen, thank you everybody for joining today, couldn't be happier to present our results. We think we're on a good track and look forward to reconvening to report our third quarter earnings.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call.

This morning I am joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from, Diane Bessette our Vice President and Treasurer, Rick Beckwitt our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto are all here with us, Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer is with us by phone from California and some of that group will be joining in our conversations during the Q&A period.","I am going to briefly give some remarks as I always do and Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial detail and give some further guidance for next year as we always do at this time of year and then we'll open up to Q&A.As always, I'd like to request one question and one follow-up, so we can have as many participants as possible.","So let me go ahead and begin. Our fourth quarter and year-end results reflect our disciplined adherence to our company-wide strategies of managing our business to a clearly defined growth rate in order to run our business efficiently, while generating cash flow in order to fortify our balance sheet.","We grew our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings by 11% and 14% respectively, while we improved our balance sheet to a 33.4% homebuilding net debt to total cap ratio, which is now back to our pre-downturn financial condition. We view that as quite an accomplishment.","Across our platform in each of our business segments, we improved performance and operations to position for the future and to make the overall company stronger. As we arrive at the close of 2016, we are better able to achieve our overall goal of reverting to a pure-play homebuilder with an excellent operating platform and a healthy capital structure that enables us to be both opportunistic and to ultimately return capital to shareholders in the future.","All of this was accomplished in the context of market conditions that were suboptimal in 2016, defined by overall slow, but directionally steady market improvement that was often choppy and sometimes complicated.","As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to see a generally similar economic environment to find the homebuilding landscape with some potential upside from the new administration in Washington. Our company strategies of soft pivot on land, 7% to 10% growth target and improved cash flow will remain the same for now and we expect to achieve similar growth and balance sheet improvements in 2017 as Bruce will detail in our guidance for the next year.","These expectations derive from the following general views. Even with the now clear upward momentum movement in interest rates mapped out by the Fed and the many questions around taxes in the regulatory environment raised by our incoming potentially business friendly new President, we expect to see continued slow but steady market improvement that can be choppy and erratic at times as the new administration goes to the throes of enacting the agenda of change, upside exist to this view if a general sense of optimism continues to dominate and changes happen quicker, we'll have to wait and see.","We continue to believe though that production levels in the $1 million to $1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing. The rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years should continue to drive overall growth in the housing market. Therefore we see the current levels of production forming somewhat of a downside or floor to the market.","Even with interest rates moving higher, the first time homebuyer will continue to come back to the market as stronger economic conditions should drive purchasers to the market undeterred by the marginally higher monthly payment, especially in the context of continued rent increases.","Lower unemployment, wage growth and general consumer confidence should drive household formation, which drives families to purchase homes and to rent apartment. We believe that there continues to be strong pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than in others and this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rates.","This goes for both the first time and the move up purchasers. While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, we feel that any relaxing of the hyper regulated baking system will normalize the mortgage market, which should enable more purchasers to find their way to home ownership.","We continue to expect that demand will build and come to the market over the next years and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing start ultimately needs to be replenished.","Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand. We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady though positive homebuilding market that will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry.","These had been our consistent guiding views over the past year and we've mapped our operating strategy around these views through at this point we leave room for upside as we look ahead.","Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2017 and beyond and we believe -- and we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of our business segments going forward.","Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale core homebuilding operations have operated a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence throughout 2016.","As we've noted in past conference calls, we've adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive on the retail side. We've noted three key components of our core homebuilding strategy. Number one, soft pivot on land purchases; number two, lower targeting growth rate and number three, heavy focus on SG&A.","We've continued to reduce our combined land and land development spend and new orders in the fourth quarter and the full year grew at 9% while the year -- while deliveries for the year were also up 9%. This is right on top of our targeted growth rate and has enabled us to focus on reducing SG&A while driving cash flow.","We've reduced our SG&A throughout the year even while continued labor shortages, construction cost increases and land increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on SG&A in the fourth quarter to bring it to an 8.7% rate to offset pressure on gross margins and maintain a strong net margin, which came in at 14.6% for the quarter.","This was accomplished while we've also been increasing our spend on companywide technologies in order to realize additional reductions in the future. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to continue to focus on these three pillars of our operating strategy in order to drive performance.","Our first of those pillars, we continue our soft pivot on land strategy as we are targeting high-quality A location -- A location land acquisition with a shorter two to three year average life. Additionally, we're focused on expanding our first time homebuyer offering organically with lower land cost as that segment of the market has continued to recover.","And finally, we've used the opportunistic, proposed purchase of WCI to fill in some blanks and partially offset land purchases, upgrading our land positions with already mature communities.","Second, we've noticed -- noted in past quarterly conference calls given the now mature recovery that we will continue to manage our growth in order to concurrently grow the bottom line and drive strong cash flows. We continue to manage the growth target -- our growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin.","In the third prong with less pressure on top line growth rate, we've intensified management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down.","Under the company mantra, as I said last quarter of what we can measure, we can change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operating platform. I noted the example in past quarters that we've been reducing customer acquisition costs through our digital marketing initiative.","We've expanded our focus to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expensive -- in expenses in those areas as well.","It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 8.7% is the lowest fourth quarter SG&A in our company's history and allow -- and that follows last quarter's lowest third quarter SG&A.","Our homebuilding operations are truly becoming extremely efficient operating machine with demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our three-pronged strategy for homebuilding -- for our homebuilding segment, positions us well for steady growth as well as the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically.","Moving on, our financial services group has also had an outstanding year of accomplishment in 2016. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic refi market as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms.","While we expect refi opportunities to diminish as rates rise, the other sidecar opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we move through 2016 and that's reflected in our fourth quarter earnings of $51.4 million versus $33.8 last year.","Our strategy for 2017 for financial services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully self sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar homebuilding business, but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments.","Next our multifamily program LMC Lennar Multifamily Communities, really matured in 2016 into a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. LMC had an incredible quarter in our fourth quarter.","Earnings totaled $41.4 million up 306% from the $10.2 million in 2015. During the fourth quarter, we sold four of our merchant build apartment communities all with high IRRs and twp plus multiples. During the fourth quarter, we started 1,155 apartment homes in five communities with a total development cost of approximately $469 million.","As of November 30, 2016, we have -- we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 74 communities, totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $7.7 billion.","Also during the fourth quarter, we had the final close of our now $2.2 billion Lennar Multifamily Venture, LMV -- we call LMV. LMV represents the largest equity capital raise ever completed in the multifamily industry and demonstrates the confidence venture investors have place in LMC and our new build-to-core strategy that will allow us to maintain an ownership interest in a portfolio of income producing communities going forward.","We continue to see growing demand in housing, both in our core homebuilding business as well as our multifamily platform and this venture is a key building block for one of our growing ancillary businesses.","Next our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the back half of 2016 as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of the year. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve, particularly for RMF Rialto Mortgage Finance, which has maintained its position as one of the largest non-bank CMBS originators.","RMF completed its 32nd through 31st securitization transaction during the quarter selling over $622 million of RMF originated loans with very healthy net margins. This brings our total to over $6.5 billion of securitized loans since RMF's inception.","On the investment management front, we also previously announced first quarter closings of commitments for our third fund. This fund will complement our other opportunistic funds with readily available capital to invest.","Our first two flagship opportunity funds have continued to be top quartile producers. Fund one as an example became fully invested in early 2013 and we've now distributed the 141% of investor's original capital from income and monetization and with the distribution through this quarter, Rialto has now realized two times its original investment with a lot more to go.","Fund two made its final investment during the first quarter, investing including recycling over $1.6 billion of equity in 100 transactions and similar to fund one, we've been making distributions already returning about 36% of investor's original commitments.","Rialto's investment in asset management platform had been growing its asset base as well as harvesting value for investors and us. In a little over six years, we've now raised almost $7 billion of equity in a variety of real estate funds and investment vehicle we've invested about $6.1 billion of equity and we've already returned $4.8 billion to investors who have earned in excess -- who have earned almost $2.4 billion over the years.","Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and as we look ahead to 2017, Rialto earnings will continue to grow as we work through our remaining legacy assets and refine our businesses into a two-pronged capital-light segment focused solely on RMF Rialto Mortgage Finance and the investment management business as well.","Finally FivePoint is now a self-sufficient standalone company that\u2019s a premier strategic large scale community builder in California. In 2016, we successfully contributed and exchanged our interest in three strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings LLC.","This transaction liberated FivePoint in 2016 to start acting independently to raise capital and to use its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically. It also positioned FivePoint to take advantage of either a recovered IPO market should that happen for other opportunities as they arise. We simply could not be more excited about the long-term prospects for this one of a kind leader in community development.","So overall and in conclusion let me say 2016 was a great strategic year for the company and it sets up another year of consistent performance and opportunity. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that we've successfully implemented in our business have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth in 2017 and beyond.","So now let me turn over to Bruce.","Bruce Gross","Thanks Stuart and good morning. I'll provide some additional color on our 11% earnings increase over the prior year.","Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by an 8% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $357,000.","Our gross margin on home sales in the fourth quarter was 23.3%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 24.6%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs and construction costs.","Sales incentives were 6.2% this quarter compared to 5.9% in the prior year. The slight increase was primarily due to our focus on reducing completed unsold homes, which we managed to decreased by 13% year-over-year to 975 homes.","Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East region and our direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 3% year-over-year to approximately $54 per square foot and this was driven entirely by the labor side, which was offset just slightly by a small decrease in material costs.","Our SG&A percentage improved 50 basis points as Stuart mentioned to 8.7% in the fourth quarter. About 30 basis points of that improvement was attributable to operating leverage from growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and the other 20 basis points was due to improvement and advertising costs, which we reduced as a result of our focus on digital marketing.","Gross profits on land sales during the quarter were $24.3 million was primarily driven by 3 million transactions during the quarter versus 7.9 million in the prior year.","Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $24.6 million, which included our share of net operating losses from the newly created FivePoint entity. We opened 66 new communities during the fourth quarter to end the quarter with 695 active communities.","New home orders -- new home orders increased 9% and the new order dollar value increased 12% for the quarter. Our sales pace was higher during the quarter to 3.2 sales per community, per month, versus 3.0 in the prior year and the cancellation rate was 18%.","During the quarter, we purchased approximately 4,500 home sites, totaling $259 and this is the same dollar amount that we purchased in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with what Stuart highlighted about our soft pivot strategy, where we're focused on buying shorter duration land while continuing to grow the company.","The number of years of land owned has now been reduced to 4.8 years. Our home sites owned and controlled now total 159,000 home sites of which 33,000 are controlled. Our financial services business segment had strong results with operating earnings of $51.4 million compared to $33.8 million in the prior year.","Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.6 million from $25.9 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment and higher volumes. Mortgage originations increased to $2.7 million compared to $2.4 billion in the prior-year and we captured 81% of Lennar homebuyers.","As a result of a focused effort to capitalize on the low mortgage rates in the fourth quarter, we achieved a 72% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year. Refinance volume was 15% of the total origination volume, but the strong refinance market also drove higher margins per loan.","Our title company's profit increased to $14.9 million in the quarter from $8 million in the prior year and this was primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume and the focus on operational efficiencies.","Providing a little bit more color on Rialto segment, the produced operating earnings of $8 million compared to $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interests. The investment management business contributed $33.1 million of earnings, which included $4.6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $28.5 million of management fees and other.","At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate funds one and two, now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $622 million of commercial loans into four securitization resulting in earnings of $35.6 million compared with $854 million and $15.8 million in the prior year respectively, before their G&A expenses.","The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in average net margins of the securitizations from 2.2% in the prior year to 5.8% in the fourth quarter. The direct investments in Rialto had a loss of $10.7 million in the quarter and Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $43.3 million for the quarter and interest expense excluding the warehouse lines was $6.7 million. Rialto also ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $149 million of cash.","Adding to Stuart's comments on multifamily, the $41.4 million operating profit in the quarter was driven primarily by the segment's $47.2 million share gains from the sale of four operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses.","We ended the quarter with five completed and operating properties and 38 under construction, 13 of which are in lease up, totaling over 11,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $3.4 billion, so you could see the pipelines for the sales that we're going to talk about for 2017.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%. The rate is lower than our previous guidance, primarily as a result of the tax department's continuing efforts to maximize new home energy efficiency credit, which is currently set to expire at the end of 2016. As a result of the expiration of this credit, we expect the tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 34%.","Turning to the balance sheet, the matching of the operating strategies with our execution has returned our balance sheet to the very healthy levels that existed before the downturn. We highlighted that the soft pivot strategy, strong profitability and the conversion of our converts will drive the path to lower leverage.","The result was an 880 basis point decline in net debt to total cap, going from 42.2% at the end of the prior year to 33.4% at this year end. This year we generated between $400 million and $500 million of operating cash flow in 2016. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with now over $1 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $1.8 billion revolving credit facility.","Our balance sheet is rock solid and its positioning us well for tomorrow's opportunities. Additionally, stockholders equity now exceeds $7 billion and our book value per share increased to $29.96 per share.","During the quarter, we converted the remaining $157 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes. Next step for the balance sheet will be continued focus on cash flow generation and retiring the $400 million of 12.25% debt on June 1, which currently cost us approximately $50 million of interest per year.","Now I would like to provide some goals for 2017. Please note these goals exclude the benefit from the WCI acquisition, which we will update in our first quarter conference call assuming the transaction closes as expected in our first quarter.","We still expect the transaction to be accretive to our fiscal 2017 numbers, excluding transaction costs. Number one deliveries, we are currently geared up to deliver between 28,500 and 29,000 deliveries for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 70% for the first quarter, between 80% and 85% for the second and third quarters and over 90% for the fourth quarter.","We are expecting an average sales price between 365,000 and 370,000 for the full year. We expect operating margins to be around 13% for the full year. The full year gross margin is expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to somewhere between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year.","There will be seasonality between the quarters with the first quarter being the lowest operating margin and the operating leverage is expected primarily in the second half of the year to match up with our highest volume quarters.","Financial services are expected to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million for the year. The quarterly amounts are expected to be spread fairly similar to 2016 with the first quarter anticipated to be the lowest quarter of profitability.","With rising interest rates, we expect the strong refinance market that we did see in 2016 to start to slow down as we go through 2017. Rialto is expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year and the second half of the year is expected to have the bulk of the profitability for this segment.","Multifamily expects to sell seven to eight multifamily communities in 2017 with a range of profits between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. We expect to be profitable each quarter with the fourth quarter profits similar to 2016's very strong fourth quarter.","The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income group together, we're expecting to have a range of $70 million to $80 million of profitability for this category and although we don't anticipate profitability in the first two quarters of the year out of this grouping, we do expect strong profitability in the second half of the year.","Corporate G&A is expected to be between 2.2% and 2.3% of total company revenues as we continue to invest and repiping our systems and technology initiatives. As I mentioned our tax rate for 2017 should be approximately 34% and our net community count is expected to increase approximately 7% from our account of 695 with the increased spread throughout the year primarily in the second, third, and fourth quarters.","And then finally we continue to focus on cash flow generation and expect to generate a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we get into 2016. With these goals in mind we are well-positioned to deliver another strong profitable year in 2017.","With that let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.","Ivy Zelman","Thank you. Congratulations guys on another solid quarter. Stuart, if you can talk a little bit about the usage of free cash flow that's very impressive in '17 and how to increase shareholder value with that free cash flow where they get deployed and thinking about the uncertainties, but as you've mentioned in your opening remarks, the positive potential business environment that we may or pro-business administration may be taking, thinking about the opportunities that you think will the pluses or minuses of the new administration at least what you've heard so far.","I think people are pretty interested if you go into little bit more specific obviously tax reforms, some of the things that might drive how you invest that free cash flow to drive shareholder value?","Stuart Miller","Okay. So that was a multipart question, Ivy. I'm going to give you credit for the two point questions and your follow up on that. So to start off with you asked about free cash flow and how we might think to deploy that to enhance shareholder value and let me say hats off to Rick as he aptly negotiated our proposed deal with WCI.","He injected great deal of optionality \u200efor us in the way that we think about the use of cash versus stock when we do have optionality all the way for quite some time until closing.","And so we're thinking about the way that we use cash to enhance shareholder value in all transactions whether it's the purchase of new land, whether it's other deals that we are considering opportunistically or whether it's the way that we use cash and stock.","And we'll keep a lot of optionality injected in our program so that we can watch as the world around us given the new administration starts to really unfold. So we're very keenly considering how we think about the use of cash. We've injected lot of optionality and you can expect that that's going to be a primary focus for our corporate office.","So that was part one. You asked about some of the discussion points and administrative changes that might come along with a new administration. We've been giving a lot of thought to that.","There are some murkier waters, some questions around tax rate reductions and how they might ripple through, how they might result in cash savings. I think we're going to have to wait and see what the details are but as the landscape shifts, as a tax policy that has been articulated actually get formed, there are going to be some change agents in the way that customers think about whether or not they want to purchase or whether or not they have the capital to deploy.","We think that the tax changes are going to have some significant impact not just to the individual or potential customers, but also to our corporate tax rate in the way that we kind of configure our organization.","Corporate taxes as articulated are likely to go down, but what other elements of the tax code might change at the same time is something that we're going to have to say on top of.","Around the regulatory environment, there's a whole host of regulatory constraint that has defined the housing market not the least of which is the way the banks have been not only regulated, but also prosecuted has certainly shifted the landscape for the mortgage industry or defined the landscape for the mortgage industry.","What it seems to be like -- what seems to be lightning of that regulatory or prosecutorial environment would in my opinion result in more normalization of the mortgage market and therefore greater access to the mortgage market by the lower middle class, which I think would be healthy not only for the housing industry, but also for the economy in general and I think we've been saying that for a long time.","All of these pieces as we see new administration come and as we see that confidence has been lifted, we'll see how that ripple through the selling season and how consistent it stays.","All of these provide opportunities for us to look opportunistically about as to how we deploy our cash and how we think about cash flow turning into the building of shareholder value. So I hope that answers the question.","Ivy Zelman","It did. And my follow-up, would just be thank you, it was helpful, just the word you mentioned becoming a pure play homebuilder, can you elaborate on what that means and is there any other businesses\u2026","Stuart Miller","Listen, we've said in past conference calls that our focus had shifted last year to saying okay, how do we position our ancillary businesses to bring them to where they ought to be. The goal for the company is to be a pure play homebuilder.","Whether that includes our apartment effort or not is something that we're considering openly, that it might be inclusive of our multifamily program. So we hold that open to see how we think about it in the future, but clearly we've been focused on FivePoint and Rialto maturing and positioning those companies for other forms of ownership.","We've articulated that FivePoint, we've looked at an IPO opportunity, the IPO market closed up on us and we're looking other strategic opportunities. We've really refined the ownership structure for FivePoint, so that it's positioned and ready to go, should the right opportunity come along and we're focused on that and looking for that.","Likewise with Rialto, 2016 and continuing into 2017 as we resolve the legacy component of our asset base really refines Rialto to become a self-sufficient operation a lot like FivePoint already is and positions it to find its way into some different form of ownership.","As we resolve these ancillary businesses, we really clarify our position as a pure play homebuilder defined by our core homebuilding business, financial services, which is a sidecar program and potentially by our multifamily group also.","But as you can see with this year's performance on the multifamily side, we've really positioned that entity to also be have -- to have a lot of optionality and what we do with it because this is becoming a very valuable enterprise for the company and quite compatible with our core for-sale business.","Ivy Zelman","Great, that's very helpful. And congratulations again and happy holidays to all you guys.","Stuart Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Stephen East","Thank you. Thank you, Stuart for that explanation on your ancillary businesses. It takes you some questions there. So I'll go back to the gross margin that you all talked about 22% to 22.5%, as you look at 2017 what are the moving parts in driving that down?","Is land still the biggest driver or do you see labor and materials and incentives moving up there? And then just an idea of where you all think it will bottom and roughly when you think that would occur?","Rick Beckwitt","Stephen, its Rick. As we said the past, land is certainly one of the drivers that affects the gross margin. We benefited from some opportunistic purchases. We're now more of a wholesale buyer of land that's affecting margin and we think that in that 22% to 22.5% range, that's a solid margin and it's -- as you know it's much higher than where the rest of the industry is.","Another thing that's impacting that is our continuing shift towards the lower price market that those had lower gross margins but higher IRRs and that gets them to the overall strategy that we have as a company.","Where the bottom is, I don\u2019t think it's much lower than where we are in the 22% side and we're just going to have to see is that, that comes across. If you look at higher cycles for the industry somewhere in that 21% to 21.5% range has always been considered a pretty solid gross margin and we feel that operationally we should be able to do better than that.","Stuart Miller","Just add to that let me say that look there's some upside to the world as we think about it right now. I think in a lot of ways supply remains fairly constrained. As I noted in my comments the land and the labor markets are constraining factors in terms of how quickly the building industry can really respond.","Increases in demand would give a little bit of pricing power. So there are lot of moving parts right now and a lot to consider. I think we'll have to wait and see. And Jon do you want to comment at all on the construction costs?","Jon Jaffe","Sure. As has been mentioned already there's real constraint in labor market, but I think that operationally we been very effective in managing that. We said it's up about 2% year-over-year for our single-family detached product and that's really come from a focus on our relationships with our trade partners with a real intensity towards programs such as job site readiness and ebb and flow and as always our everything's included strategy really helps us in a labor constrained market be simpler and more efficient to build.","And we also see that in our cycle times as evidenced, it's come down consecutively from our second quarter to our third and now to our fourth quarter. We see reduction in a number of days of cycle time. So there's real pressure but I'm very proud of the way our management team is on top of that as a daily focus.","Stephen East","All right. Thanks. I appreciate that. And I did actually have one question on the ancillary businesses, on the four buildings that you sold, were the cap rate spreads between construction what you sold them for, what you expected?","Are you seeing any change in the market? I know that the closer end A-plus luxury locations seem to be getting a bit forward but you all are aren't there. So I'm wondering if you're seeing any change in the profitability of these buildings as you sell them versus what you pro forma that?","Rick Beckwitt","Steve, it's Rick again. We were very strategic when we identified where we're going to roll out this program. And as we look at last quarter or even for last year, our underwriting has been tall as we're having 2 plus cash-on-cash multiples. We've got high double-digit IRRs. We're just knocking it off out of the park.","Stephen East","That\u2019s all right. Thank you.","Stuart Miller","Steve, if your question, are cap rates starting to move?","Stephen East","Yeah.","Stuart Miller","Yes, so I think -- I don\u2019t think we've seen much movement in cap rate yet and whether there's going to be as interest rates go up, there are a lot of arguments around cap rates relative to the apartment world.","We continue to have the view that the shortage in dwellings both rental and for-sale across the country that has been the result of the underproduction over the past years is going to continue to reflect in a fairly strong rental market, which makes this asset class very desirable.","We've seen this as Rick's gone out and raised the capital for this build-to-core fund that we have in place. We've continued to see that internationally there is still a sizable demand for this asset class and while there will be some ebb and flow as certain portfolios of buyers get a little bit more full, we're fully loaded in this asset class, we'll see a little ebb and flow in some of those cap rates.","I think directionally we're still going to see a fairly strong cap rate relative to the sale of these kinds of properties and their valuation.","Rick Beckwitt","And I guess that other detail I give you Steve is if you look at our portfolio, as Bruce said, we've got 74 communities in total. 40 of those in merchant build and balance 34 are in our fund as of today. So given if cap rates do moderate, we've got the ability to milk the asset through the income producing nature of fund and that was our strategic decision to have a dual prong strategy.","I think that we're really well positioned to maximize this and as the market recovers, if the market softens and then recovers in the future, we're going to have this portfolio of two, three, four year old properties that we can certainly monetize it at that point.","Stephen East","I got you. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Mike Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone and nice quarter again. First question I was hoping to hit on some of the more recent sales trends that you've seen let's say over the last six weeks if it's still all possible to common obviously with the rate movement not being as dramatic as in short of a time what we saw in 2013, but we have had six weeks now of rate move that\u2019s kind of totaled up at around 80 basis points.","So I was hoping to get a little sense of number one how, how the order growth cadence occurred during 4Q and again as you think about November into the first half of December if you've seen any difference in at least in terms of the year-over-year obviously seasonality wise, it's a softer but from year-over-year or sequential periods it's seems a little different than what you would expect.","Rick Beckwitt","Yeah Michael, it's Rick. We generally don't talk about anything in close quarter with regard to sales. What we can tell you is that as you look at our Q4, each month showed year-over-year increases with an increase throughout the quarter and percentage of year-over-year change.","Mike Rehaut","And would that be for total order growth or sales pace when you refer to the\u2026","Rick Beckwitt","That would be for total order growth.","Mike Rehaut","Okay. And I appreciate that Rick and I guess just secondarily, when you think about the first time business and you kind of alluded to the fact that that can also or perhaps is having an impact on the direction of gross margins in '17 perhaps even further out than that.","I was hoping if you could just remind us of what your first time business was as a percent of closings let's say in the fourth quarter, how that compares to the full year and where you might see that go over the next -- over the next 12 or 24 months.","Rick Beckwitt","We've been running in the high 30% from a percentage basis. If you look at the land that we've been contracting and we've certainly made a shift on that, you can expect that percentage to go up over the next year two years.","Bruce Gross","To about 40%, that's where we expect to be going forward.","Rick Beckwitt","Just more of a historical norm too.","Mike Rehaut","So it's high 30s to 40 doesn't seem too aggressive of a shift that can go to 45. Just given the increased focus and as you talk about it, I would expect something little bit more, is there anything that's constraining that because obviously it's something that I think a lot of the industry is moving towards.","Stuart Miller","We'll you know we've never been one to follow the herd. We've been more kind of self determined. We have a strong view that the product offerings that we have right now are pretty strong and while we are shifting back towards kind of a historical norm of where we think the percentages of first-time home buyer product that would like to have, we don't feel that with interest rates moving up, with the market still defining itself, we have the option to accelerate that pace if we want to. But we didn't feel that it was the right time to make a more dramatic shift.","Rick Beckwitt","And I think the other thing is that all this is definitional. On the edges we feel that there's still a good strong market in that lower-priced first time moved up market, which is a big component of our -- of our offering, product offering across U.S. So it's where you draw that line with regard to ASP.","Mike Rehaut","No it's fair points and worthwhile to be stated, so I appreciate the additional color. Thanks a lot guys.","Jon Jaffe","One more point on that, this is Jon that we also have our next gen strategy, which as Stuart said is more of a leadership position than a following position, which represents about 6% of our total sales and the average sales price of our next gen product offering is up 35% higher than our average sales price inclusive of that next gen pricing.","So we do have different strategies that we think balance our offerings into the marketplace if that\u2019s appropriate.","Mike Rehaut","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question is from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Your line is now open.","Jade Rahmani","Thanks for taking my question. Just on the WCI acquisition, I was wondering if you could say at this point based on what you see it had whether your intention is to keep the company's overall net leverage neutral as you look at that deal?","Stuart Miller","Jade as I said earlier, we really maintained maximum optionality there. We have a number of moving parts, number of things that we consider and are considering and so we're going to maintain that optionality and really not give additional color at this point just because we are considering other opportunities that are out there that we think compete for cash and balance sheet.","And I think as you've seen us do before, we'll allocate capital in the direction where we think we can have the greatest impact on shareholder value over the long-term. So that's kind of where we would like to leave the answer to that right now.","Jade Rahmani","On the Rialto side, can you say whether you think the current M&A environment remains fruitful in terms of opportunities to grow the platform and whether any rollback of the Dodd Frank risk retention would have a negative impact on Rialto's business?","Stuart Miller","Our general view is that regardless of which way things go, relative to current regulation and some of our initial thinking around how the regulatory environment would benefit us, we're kind of positioned for prosperity, regardless of which way it goes.","Think about a rising interest rate environment relative to our conduit business, our loan origination business, our B-Piece buying business, all of these arenas tend to be activated by changes in the environment. We think there's still a very strong case to be made for the dollars that we're investing and whether risk retention remains in place defines a new environment that we will help craft or whether we revert to the way things have been working in the past, we're just very well positioned to continue with a very strong strategy of producing outsized returns.","Jade Rahmani","Thanks very much.","Stuart Miller","You bet. Next question.","Operator","Thank you, yes. Next question is from John Lovallo of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","John Lovallo","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my call. First question is on homebuilding operating profit, if you just look at the low-end of the outlook that you guys put out there, it would seem to imply call very low single-digit growth in operating income.","So I guess the question is, is there what kind of macro environment are you thinking about when you put that out there and also are there additional levers on the SG&A line that you might be able to pull understanding that you guys have hit all-time lows of the past few quarters.","Bruce Gross","Okay. John as far as the macro environment we're not assuming a very different macro environment from what you're seeing now. The reduction in gross margin is consistent with what we've been saying that some of the opportunistic land position that we purchased they're just not as large of a percentage of those as we go forward.","And therefore the land cost is going up a little bit and construction costs have gone up a little bit. So not a different macro environment and SG&A levers, there's a lot of focus that we have is where we're typing all of the technology in our company and restore the benefit through digital marketing is how we've reduced advertising costs.","We think there's an opportunity to continue to make progress really on all the line items that we have with our fixed marketing costs as well as continuing to grow organically will continue to lever the overhead in our divisions because we're not growing our divisions at the same pace that we're growing our overall volume.","Stuart Miller","Let me just add to it. I wanted to be very clear in my opening remarks. We're really looking at a steady-state environment as we craft our strategy going forward. But we think that there are some unique upside potentials out there and I've tried to articulate some of those.","But the way that we're thinking about both our guidance and the way that we're crafting the strategy within the company, we've seen a lot of choppiness in the economic environment over the past quarters that we've and other builders have had to navigate.","There are constraints on land. There are constraints on labor. So we recognize that the environment we have to look at is that\u2019s consistent with where we are, but we think that there's opportunity for upside and that's how we've positioned the company.","John Lovallo","Okay. That's helpful. I guess the next question would be talking about the land and labor constraints, it sounded if I heard this correctly, you're looking for 7% community count growth and I think you said that's excluding WCI. If that is the case what do you guys attributing the ability to deliver that kind of community count growth to given the aforementioned headwinds.","Bruce Gross","That's excluding WCI, so 7% although as Stuart mentioned in his remarks, there is the opportunity that some of the WCI assets might replace some of the assets we were to bring online.","Stuart Miller","As we sit right now, it's a kind of complicated time for us to knit these pieces together because WCI as with any transaction that has been enclosed is a proposed transaction. But the WCI acquisition as it occurs and we believe it will, will knit together with some of these numbers and there won't be a clear distinction between them because some of the WCI communities are going to potentially replace communities that we might have purchased otherwise.","Remember we're purchasing excellent communities that are already mature and underway and that's very attractive to us and our platform. So this will all dovetail into a narrative that will take greater shape after a closing.","John Lovallo","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Stuart Miller","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Stephen Kim of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, this is actually [Trim] on for Steve Kim. Thanks for taking the questions. First could you talk about these new operating losses that are occurring in FivePoint and how long you're expecting those to continue to persist?","Bruce Gross","This is Bruce. So really when you look at FivePoint and all the joint ventures, they have overhead associated with them each quarter, that would result in a net operating loss unless there was a transaction of a land sale. So it's really then continuing to operate their business and it's a question of what quarter the land sales occur and it intends to bunch up.","So my commentary about the quarters and the net operating losses is that the sales anticipated from the joint ventures are bunched up later in the year which means the overhead in the beginning of the year wants to be offset by any significant land sale transactions.","Stuart Miller","And that's one of the problems that we've identified relative to both Rialto and to FivePoint is that the revenues tend to be less predictable and sometimes lumpy, which really brings some confusion to the overall program wherein our homebuilding business we're able to give much greater guidance and it is much more consistently matched.","Those two subsidiaries tend to have lumpier results and can sometimes bring a little confusion.","Unidentified Analyst","Got you. Thanks for that and then secondly, you gave your land spend in acquisition, but one what was your development and two, how are you thinking about going forward given the comments of your cash flow guide for relatively flat with this year which implies higher working capital, so maybe increased dollars in land spend next year.","Bruce Gross","So we actually had a reduction on our development spend during the quarter. Last year it was $266 million. This year's fourth quarter was $240 million. So overall when you look at land and land development together, even though we're growing the company, we actually spent less in total this year versus last year.","And as we look at the positive cash flow generation for next year, that's just an estimate at this point. We're very focused on continuing the progress that we made this year and we'll continue to give you updates throughout the year, but our focus is continuing to improve the balance sheet and we'll remain opportunistic with what we do with that cash.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Stuart Miller","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nishu Sood of Deutche Bank.","Nishu Sood","Thank you. Wanted to ask you about the labor issue. So earlier last year and earlier this year when those problems were creeping up, but obviously expressed itself as rising direct construction costs and some delays in cycle times. Now both of those have come back the construction cost I think Bruce said were only up by 3% year-over-year down I think pretty nicely from where it was earlier.","And I think John mentioned the cycle time is coming down as well. So should we think about that as being solely the results obviously your intent is to manage around that or are you seeing also some improvement in the market and your thoughts looking ahead on that issue as well that would be great, thank you.","Jon Jaffe","This is Jon. We're seeing that there is pretty consistent level of constraint in labor in all the markets across the country. I think that our management team has done a particularly good job of focusing on the relationships with those trades to make sure that we're the builder of choice and it takes a lot of effort to focus and I think we're executing very well on that front.","Nishu Sood","Got it. So it sounds like mostly just the result of efforts. Okay and on the SG&A side, re-piping becoming more digitally oriented and in the selling efforts, it sounds as though that might also imply less fixed base in the SG&A and more variability perhaps.","I'm trying to look into -- obviously the efforts have yielded terrific numbers particular second half of this year with the record lows as Stuart mentioned. Only I think 20 or 30 basis points of leverage into next year on SG&A.","Does that mean a lot of that is in the business? Is it that kind of fixed versus variable distinction that I was just making. How should we think about that going forward?","Stuart Miller","I don't think that we've added variability. I don't think we've made that as a migration. I think we've just pulled cost out of the equation. When I look at and think about our migration from conventional to digital marketing, we've basically cut many of our advertising and marketing costs in half.","While we have not increased traffic, we've actually reduced actual foot traffic, but to a much higher quality of traffic. So our conversion rates have gone way up and this has really created less stress in the system. Remember that this one element is a proxy for many other areas that we're focused on around our SG&A.","But some of the results about what our digital marketing platform has done really get a little bit interesting to me because it's not just about the reduction in cost, it's about the ability to drive traffic and to continue to enhance what we're already doing.","So just some stats, our digital marketing resulted in Internet leads being up 35% to over 90,000. Our social media followers are up 22% to 2.7 million and our YouTube views are up by 11 million to 33 million.","These are really big numbers that derive from the ability to actually focus on something and to use digital technologies to our advantage. Now when we talk about re-piping our system, we're re-piping the operational side of our business to be able to apply the same focuses to things like even flow and even distribution of closings through a quarter.","To focus on a number of components of our business that we think can eliminate duplication in the way that we handle our financial accounting and the distribution of information through our company and as these things are applied, we think we can have the same meaningful actual reduction in cost as we go forward.","Nishu Sood","Got it. Thank you.","Stuart Miller","Okay. Why don\u2019t we take one more question.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And our last question is from Jay McCanless of Wedbush. Your line is now open.","Jay McCanless","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. On the community count, you talked about I believe up 7% as a little bit faster than what we were expecting. Could you talk about where you expect to grow the bulk of the communities?","Bruce Gross","I got to look most of their community growth are in that asset investment really close to our larger markets California, Texas and Florida. We have spent, intensified our effort in the Carolinas and in Georgia. So you'll see increased community count growth from those areas.","Jay McCanless","Okay. And then on the cancellation rate, looks like it was down or up about 100 basis points year-over-year. Can you guys talk about what's going on there and is that part of what you were discussing before about vetting some of the people that come in to the community centers or that come into the Internet vetting them a little more closely before actually accepting the order.","Bruce Gross","Yes Jay, it actually went from 17% to 18% but both of those members are below the normal averages. So I wouldn\u2019t look at going from 17% to 18%, anything other than just some rounding. There's no issue with cancellations, it's well below long-term averages that we've experienced.","Jay McCanless","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","David Collins","Okay. So we'll wrap up there. Thanks for joining. Just in conclusion let me say 2016 was a great year for the company. We're really pleased with the results not just in terms of bottom line, but also in operational positioning and we look forward to reporting throughout 2017. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I will now turn the call over to Alexandra Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statement.","Alexandra Lumpkin","Thank you and good morning.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Operator","Thank you. I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.","Stuart Miller","Very good and thank you. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I am here with Rick Beckwitt, Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Jaffe, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer and of course David Collins is here and you just heard from Alex Lumpkin.","So, I'm going to start with a general strategic overview. Rick and Jon will give the land and operational overview, and Diane will deliver further detail on our third quarter numbers as well as some preliminary guidance for 2019. When we get to Q&A, as always, I'd like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate as many participants.","So let me go ahead and begin by saying that our once again strong quarterly results derived from a seasoned, well-coordinated operating team that is hands-on and hitting on all cylinders. With pro forma new orders up approximately 11% year-over-year and pro forma deliveries up 11.4% year-over-year, we are tracking above our own internal targets of 7% to 10% per year growth, even through the integration of the CalAtlantic merger.","As the coordination of systems integration continues and synergies are run from operations, our management team and operating groups are fully engaged in making the adjustments that keep our performance industry leading and consistent.","Over the past quarter, market data -- sorry about that, little technology issue.","So over the past quarter, market data has sent mixed signals about the current state of the housing market in general. Sales, permits, starts and existing home sales have all shown decelerating growth rate and on their face seem to indicate slowdown. A natural mortgage application slowdown, which is normal as interest rates have trended higher and refi business dissipates, has contributed to the discourse.","Generally speaking, the increases in new and exhibit -- the increases in new and existing sales prices -- home sale prices over the past years together with the general migration of interest rates upward have caused a pause in the progression of the housing recovery. Additionally, labor shortages, trade-driven material price increases and limited approved land availability have both limited production, and therefore limited supply and muted sentiment around the housing market strength and margin sustainability.","This has led many to believe that the housing recovery is over or stalled. We do not agree. Instead, we believe the market has taken a natural pause, it will adjust and demand driven by fundamental economic strength will resume. Even as price increases and interest rate movements have moderated demand in the market, we believe that the housing market in the United States remains strong and is primarily driven by the deficit in production that has persisted over a decade.","This production deficit defines an overall housing shortage in the country that cannot correct quickly with short labor and limited approved land. Supply of dwellings, both for sale and for rent, is short and demand remains strong, though perhaps slower and more normalized in the short term, as the market adjusts to prices and interest rates. While we clearly saw sales slow and traffic moderate during the third quarter, we feel that this is a natural pause, given the relative strength that has been in the market to date.","This pause we believe is a temporary adjustment, as strong unemployment, wage growth, consumer confidence and economic growth drive the consumer to catch up. Now even as market conditions fluctuate, I am increasingly enthusiastic about the evolving position of our business platform with size and market share in the best national market and as the leader in the home building industry. We're not only well positioned to execute on our current operational strategies, but we have become ever more adaptable and capable of quickly adjusting to changing landscapes around us.","As a management team, we believe that we're excellently structured and positioned to continue to grow our business, while we leverage scale in each of our markets to drive efficiencies and we implement new technologies to enhance bottom line and free cash flow. Given the current mismatch [Audio Gap].","Before I turn over to Rick and Jon and Diane, let me bring -- let me provide a brief map of our operating and capital allocation strategy going forward. Then our management team will review the quarter in detail and give more guidance on our road ahead. So let me begin by noting that our debt to total cap is right now at 40% at the end of the third quarter versus 42.4% last quarter. Our net debt to total cap is 39%.","Using a combination of strong earnings and very strong and improving cash flow, we\u2019ve continued to improve our balance sheet and this affords us great flexibility in the strategy that we deploy going forward. We have grown and will continue to grow our top line as the market evolves. Through this year and next year, we will continue to grow top line, consistent with our land driven home site growth strategy of 7% to 10% improvement per year. ","As we look ahead to 2020, given the extremely tight and expensive land market, we\u2019ll begin to tap back that home site growth target, driving our land acquisition program closer to the 5% to 7% range, while we continue to focus on our land soft pivot strategy and decrease the percentage of home sites we purchased outright versus control under option, generating higher rates of return and greater cash flow.","While we moderate future home site growth at the top line, we will continue to aggressively grow bottom line by focusing more sharply on operational excellence and efficiency. We'll continue to use our size and scale in strategic markets to realize on the synergies from the CalAtlantic merger, drive efficiencies and construction costs and technique and leverage SG&A. Our focus on operational efficiency will enable us to maintain consistently high gross margins, while we expand our net operating margin as well.","Various elements of our program such as the reduction of debt and debt service and builder of choice initiatives with our building partner base will continue to offset pressures on gross margins. Additionally, our technology initiatives with Opendoor, Blend, Hippo, States Title, Notarize and others enable us to build a better mousetrap, reduce SG&A, and drive a higher net margin.","Strong margins together with a reduced growth rate and focused attention on our soft land pivot combined to generate greater free cash flow. With cash flow building and our balance sheet already strong and improving, we expect to allocate capital strategically, first to continue to pay down debt, but simultaneously to actively consider the repurchase of our stock opportunistically.","If the market discounts the value of our business, then our best returns on invested capital will be realized by investing in the assets that we know best and we are always driven by what is best for creating shareholder value. Additionally, as we've discussed in prior calls, we are continuing to drive efficiencies by focusing on our core homebuilding business. This means repositioning or opportunistically monetizing non-core assets and business lines in order to drive efficiencies or enhance cash flow.","Lennar\u2019s Rialto platform is a good example that we've discussed in prior quarters. As we have noted, we've engaged investment bankers and began a process to maximize value about two quarters ago. To date, we've mapped a constructive reconfiguration of that segment with Rialto mortgage finance -- with the Rialto mortgage finance component, better situated with Lennar financial services, starting December 1 and where efficiencies and synergies can drive even better operating results. ","Additionally, the Rialto balance sheet assets are being segregated as well and monetized over time to maximize their value. This leaves a very manageable asset investment management business, defining our remaining Rialto segment. As part of our process, we've received offers to monetize this business, many of them attractive and we're currently evaluating those offers. But as you know with our company, we will act opportunistically and in the best interest of shareholders.","We will sell if the price and the terms negotiated are attractive and otherwise, we\u2019ll remain -- we\u2019ll retain this segment and drive earnings forward. As always, over the next quarters, we will keep you updated as decisions are made and we\u2019ll not be fielding further questions during this call on this very active process. ","Each of our core asset and business segments is being positioned for maximum efficiency and performance. Our objective, as we've stated before, is to return to operating as a simplified, pure play home builder, while maximizing the value and positioning of the extraordinary franchises we've created here at Lennar.","So with that said, in conclusion, with another excellent quarter behind us and a well-defined strategy for the future, we feel very confident that fluctuations in the market will come and go and even work to our long-term advantage as we execute our strategy. ","And with that, let me turn over to Rick and the team to give further detail on the quarter and begin our view of 2019. Rick?","Rick Beckwitt","Thanks, Stuart. Let me start quickly by summarizing our results in the third quarter and then Jon and I will update you on some of our strategic focuses. Net earnings for the quarter totaled 453 million, up 82% from 2017. Our core homebuilding operation really produced. New orders for the quarter totaled 12,319 homes, up 62% from the prior year with the dollar value of approximately 5.1 billion, representing a 73% increase from last year. ","On a pro forma basis, new home orders increased 11% from the prior year. We delivered 12,613 homes, which was up 66% from 2017. Revenues in the quarter totaled 5.7 billion, representing a 74% increase. We ended the third quarter with a sales backlog of 19,220 homes with the dollar value of 8.4 billion, up 88% and 105% respectively from 2017. Our gross margin, excluding the backlog and construction and progress write-up totaled 21.9%, which exceeded the top side of our guidance last quarter.","Finally, our SG&A in the quarter was 8.6%. This marks an all-time third quarter low and a 60 basis point improvement from 2017. It also highlights the success of our CalAtlantic integration and the power of our increased local market scale and our operating leverage. With the CalAtlantic integration behind us, we are laser focused on three strategic areas. First, construction costs and operating efficiencies; second, land acquisition and development and third, technology that improves our business.","On the construction front, we are leveraging our local market and national scale to be the low cost producer. Jon will review our activities in this area, which also focused on adjustments to how we build and procure materials to lower our overall installed cost. On the land front, we've continued to execute our soft pivot strategy, with an emphasis on controlling more land versus a more cash intensive land acquisition and development program. ","Today, approximately 25% of our home sites are controlled via option contracts and similar arrangements and our expectation is to increase this over the next several years to about 40%. This shift in land strategy will increase our returns and generate additional cash flow. During the third quarter, we entered into strategic agreements with three of our longstanding large regional developers to provide us access to their current land portfolios and exclusive access to the future residential land acquired and developed by these developers.","Given our new leading local market scale and our ability to build through all of the land that these developers own and control, we were able to structure win-win programs with each of these three companies. While each deal is slightly different, they all allow us to, one, limit our land related overhead costs, as these companies have full operations that entitle, develop and acquire land; second, control the residential land entitled, acquired and developed by these regional developers; and third and most importantly, receive the home sites developed by these companies on a just in time basis.","Our focus going forward is to align ourselves with proven regional developers that have the infrastructure and expertise to feed Lennar with a continuous stream of finished home sites. While we're at the early stages of reshaping our land program, these initial three developers provide great opportunity as they own and control approximately 55,000 home sites, with more finished home sites to come as a result of the exclusive relationships and agreements we have with these companies.","In addition, we believe we can expand and execute this strategy with these developers in other markets and that this program can serve as a template with other proven regional developers across the country. On the technology side and systems side, we are keenly focused on investing in or developing new technology that improves the operational efficiency of our business.","On prior calls, Stuart has highlighted our investment in Opendoor and our intense focus on digital marketing, which allows us to reduce our customer acquisition costs. These initiatives have produced both incremental new sales and allowed us to increase our operating margins. In the third quarter, our Rialto spend decreased another 10 basis points to 2.3% of revenue from 2.4% in the second quarter of 2017. On a year-over-year basis, our Rialto spend was down 30 basis points.","In addition, we are also focused on increasing the real time flow of information to our operating teams. Jon has highlighted our dynamic pricing model in the past and we are now rolling out real time dashboards that allow our teams to seamlessly track key operating metrics, which should increase our absorption pace and lower our overall SG&A expenses. We plan to continue these initiatives, as we're just scratching the surface to unlock the many process improvements that will increase our bottom line profitability going forward.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jon.","Jon Jaffe","Thanks, Rick. Today, I'm going to give an update on integration, cost synergies, the lumber market, the US Mexico Canadian agreement\u2019s impact on lumber as well as an overview of some of the markets in our western area. First, I want to let you know what we mean when we say we are substantially complete with the integration of CalAtlantic. In all of our divisions and all communities, we are either set for building out the remaining home sites under a modified design studio program or have converted the remaining communities to Lennar\u2019s Everything\u2019s Included platform. ","Going forward, in 2019, all communities will be under the Lennar\u2019s Everything\u2019s Included platform, with the exception of some minor build-outs of existing communities. With respect to systems migrations, this month in October, we will complete 100% of the conversion of our ERP and construction management systems as well as a complete rollout of sales force lightning as a new company wide CRM platform.","This is another great example of Lennar\u2019s execution that we feel is best in class. It's fair to say that most companies will take about two years to roll out just the Salesforce CRM, while in just 9 months from the closing date of the merger, we'll have completed the entire migration and rollout of all systems. As we complete 2018, we will do so as one company with the merger integration behind us, focused on delivering our fourth quarter and our goals for 2019.","Next, I want to confirm that we're on track to deliver the synergies targets we gave you last quarter of $160 million for 2018. This is split evenly between corporate and SG&A savings and direct construction cost savings. I also want to confirm that we're confident with our prior guidance of achieving synergies of $380 million in 2019. For 2019, the overhead savings will be about 115 million of this total. Again, this is consistent with the savings we communicated to you last quarter.","Under our construction cost savings, we're on track to deliver about $265 million of savings from synergies in 2019. We have a lot of visibility into these savings from the detailed work that comes from the division by division synergy workshops that I've described on prior calls. We've seen the strategy of having significant scale in local markets played out as planned. As I mentioned in our release this morning, this scale fits right into our focus on being builder of choice for national manufactures, suppliers and local trades.","The builder choice focus began long before the CalAtlantic merger and it\u2019s serving as a great platform to maximize the benefits of increased scale provided by the merger. The key elements of this program are Lennar\u2019s efficient Everything's Included platform, even flow production, job site readiness, cycle time accuracy and dynamic pricing. These combined with the volume of work we have in local markets make us the builder of choice for trade partners, in turn, increasing the number of bids we receive for our work. The increased bids leads to greater ability to manage both construction cost and cycle time. ","Now, I want to give some color on what we see with the lumber pricing, which is the largest cost component of our direct cost. Lumber prices peaked in the second quarter of this year, at about $600 per thousand board feet. This represents about $7800 for a typical 2500 square foot home. Today, lumber prices have dropped to about $365 per thousand board feet or $4750 per home, a difference of about $3000 per home.","The second quarter pricing will flow through our third and fourth quarter deliveries and the pricing that we see today will start to flow through our first and second quarter deliveries. With respect to the new trade agreement with Canada, there will be no relief from the existing soft lumber tariffs from that agreement. Instead, the countries have left this to be decided by the WTO under an existing complaint filed by the United States.","Now, I want to turn to some color on the markets in the West, as a lot of questions have been asked about this. As Stuart noted, we've seen traffic and sales patterns slow, as sales prices have risen, along with increased interest rates. In California markets such as the Inland Empire and Sacramento, our average sales prices increased about 11% year-over-year, while absorption pace in the Inland Empire has moderated from 5.6 sales per community per month last year to 5 sales per community per month this year.","In Sacramento, we've actually seen this pace increase to positive from a pace last year of 3.2 sales per community per month to 3.8 this year. In the coastal markets around Orange County, prices are up about 20% and absorption has slowed from about 4.7 sales per community per month to 3.1. Some of this is driven by a dramatic change in mix of product that we offer, for example, in our Altair community in Orange County, we're now selling homes priced about $2 million in our joint venture community with Toll Brothers.","In the Bay Area, prices are up about 10%, while absorptions have modified from 5.8 per community last year per month to 4.4 this year. In Seattle, prices continue to decline at double digit rates, while absorptions have cooled from a very hot pace to more normal paces of just below four sales per community per month.","In summary, we believe that the sales pace that we're seeing continues to be advantaged by a favorable imbalance of supply and demand, a constraint on land and labor in the Western markets in particular and that this sales pace will support our platform and all of our operating strategies. And we think that as Stuart mentioned earlier that this is just a pause because of dramatic rise in the rates that we've seen in the West, not just percentage wise, but in nominal dollars, very often representing multiple hundred thousand dollar increase year-over-year and we expect as the market adjusts to this increase that we\u2019ll see demand return to a very healthy pace.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Diane.","Diane Bessette","Thank you, Jon and good morning to everyone. So before I provide the details of our third quarter results, let me give a simple analysis of our numbers as compared to consensus, as I did last quarter, to assist in understanding some of the noise that continued this quarter. Our reported EPS is $1.37 and the average of all analysts\u2019 estimates is $1.17. The difference is $0.20. ","This difference of $0.20 can be separated into two categories. First, non-operating items, representing $0.14 of the difference, and second, operating items, representing $0.06 of the difference. The $0.06 is our operating beat or our outperformance, as you compare our actual results to expectations. So let me give you the details of these two categories, starting with the non-operating items.","There are two distinct components to this category. The first item is the CalAtlantic purchase accounting write-up of backlog and construction in progress. The expectation for Q3 was to record approximately $100 million of write-up. The actual amount recorded was approximately $84 million. The difference between these two amounts is just timing and will flow through in subsequent quarters.","The second item is tax rate. Our expected Q3 tax rate was 24%. The actual tax rate was 17.8%. The difference primarily relate to a one-time benefit from a tax accounting method change, implemented during the quarter and energy credit taken in the quarter. ","So now, let me turn to the operating items category. The difference here between our actual results and expectations relates to an increase in Q3 deliveries, average sales price and net margin. And as I previously stated, again, that's our operating outperformance. So hopefully that helps simplify our results from a top level. Now, let me walk through the details of our third quarter, starting with homebuilding.","As we\u2019ve mentioned, revenues from home sales increased 83% in the third quarter, driven by a 66% increase in wholly owned deliveries to 12,600 and a 10% increase in average sales price to 415,000. Both of these increases of course were primarily a result of CalAtlantic acquisition and as we've highlighted from a pro forma basis, our deliveries increased 11%.","Our third quarter gross margin on home sales was 21.9%, excluding the CalAtlantic purchase accounting impact and the prior year\u2019s gross margin of 22.8% was -- which included a $10.3 million insurance recovery that positively impacted the gross margin percentage by 30 basis points in that third quarter of \u201817. Our gross margin benefited from a decrease in sales incentives. Sales incentives improved 30 basis points to 5.2% from 5.5% in the prior year and also improved from 5.3% in the second quarter of this year.","Our third quarter SG&A was 8.6%, which as Rick highlighted was the lowest third quarter SG&A in the company's history, compared to 9.2% in the prior year. The improvement was primarily due to the operating leverage as well as our continued laser focus on obtaining benefits from our technology initiatives. We opened 134 new communities during the quarter and closed 147 communities to end the quarter with 1312 active communities.","New home orders increased 62% and new order dollar value increased 73% for the third quarter, again primarily as a result of the CalAtlantic acquisition and new orders on a pro forma basis increased 11%. As a result of our focus on inventory management and with the assistance of our dynamic pricing tool, we ended the quarter with 1248 completed, unsold home, which is just under one home per community.","This is a decrease from 1.2 homes per community in the prior year and 1.1 homes per community in the prior quarter. At the end of the quarter, our home sites owned and controlled were 262,000, of which 205,000 are owned and 57,000 are controlled. And finally, the third quarter joint venture land sales and other category had a combined earnings of 800,000 compared to a loss last year of 1.7 million.","So turning to financial services, our financial services segment had operating earnings of 56.6 million compared to 39.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage operating earnings increased to 33.8 million from 32.5 million in the prior year. Originations increased to 3 billion from $2.2 billion and 97% of originations were from purchased business, while only 3% were from refis. As we've noted for a while, this drop in refis has led to a very competitive market and is leading to lower profit per loan originated.","Our capture rate was 71%, combined Lennar and CalAtlantic versus 80% in the prior year, Lennar only. Historically, CalAtlantic\u2019s capture rate was lower than Lennar\u2019s, so we should see continued improvement in our combined rate, as we capture more of that business. Total operating earnings increased to 22.1 million from 15.6 million in the prior year. The increase again of course was due to the addition of CalAtlantic closings and a higher mix of purchase business with higher transaction values versus the prior year.","In the third quarter, our multifamily segment had an operating loss of 3.9 million compared to operating earnings of 9.1 million in the prior year. In the current quarter, we recorded 1.7 million of equity and earnings from the sale of one operating property as well as 5.1 million of promote revenue related to two properties and our LMV fund. In the prior year, we had 15.4 million of equity and earnings from sale of two operating properties and no promote revenue was recorded.","As we've noted for a while, we have been moving from a built to sell to a built to hold platform, earning fees and promotes, while creating value within our fund. We ended the quarter with 22 completed and operating properties and 28 under construction, four of which are in lease up, tolling approximately 14,800 apartments with a total development cost of approximately 4.9 billion. Including these communities, we have a total diversified development pipeline of over $10 billion and over 26,000 apartments.","And then turning to Rialto, our Rialto segment had operating earnings of 10.7 million compared to 3.2 million in the prior year and both of those amounts are net of non-controlling interests. The details of this segment\u2019s businesses are as follows. The investment management business contributed 31.4 million of earnings, primarily driven by 19.8 million of management fees. Rialto mortgage finance business contributed 517 million of commercial loans into fixed securitizations, resulting in earnings of 9.2 million before their G&A. ","The team continues to perform exceedingly well in a highly competitive commercial loan market. Direct investments had a loss of 7 million, as we continue to work through the remaining assets from the bank portfolios and G&A expenses were 23 million. ","Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with 833 million of cash. During the quarter, we had continued success with our focus on de-leveraging. We repaid $250 million of 6.95 senior notes, using available cash, not refinanced and reduced the borrowings on our revolving credit facility by 300 million. And as Stuart mentioned, at quarter end, our homebuilding debt to total cap was 40.1% and 37.9% on a net basis. Stockholders\u2019 equity increased to 14 billion and our book value per share grew $42.48 per share.","And lastly, during the quarter, we were pleased to achieve an upgrade from Fitch to investment grade. And then turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter, starting with home building, we are adjusting both our deliveries and new order guidance, primarily to reflect the impact of Hurricane Florence and also to reflect the sluggishness that we are currently seeing in the market. We are adjusting our Q4 delivery guidance to 14,500 and adjusting our Q4 new orders guidance to 11,400. ","We expect our ending community count to be approximately 1,330. We expect our Q4 average sales price to be about 420,000. We are maintaining our Q4 gross margin guidance of 22.5% to 22.75%, excluding the write-up of backlog and construction in progress and we still expect to record about 50 million in Q4 related to return of that write-up of backlog and construction in progress. ","We believe our Q4 SG&A percent will be approximately 8% to 8.1% and for the combined category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, we expect Q4 earnings to be about 20 million. We are adjusting our Q4 earnings for financial services to about 57 million, which also reflects the change in deliveries, as noted above. And for multifamily, we're maintaining our Q4 guidance of approximately 35 million. And for Rialto, we expect Q4 earnings to be about $5 million, which is a decrease from previous guidance.","We have shifted a sale of a strategic balance sheet investment from Q4 to 2019 because the investment has continued to appreciate and we therefore believe that a 2019 monetization will result in a higher return. We expect Q4 corporate G&A to be about 1.5% of total revenues and we believe we will still have a small amount of continuing integration costs of about 15 million. Our tax rate is expected to be about 24% and the weighted average share count should be about 330 million shares.","So as you put the components of our guidance together, we believe our Q4 EPS, excluding the write-up of backlog and construction in progress and integration costs should be approximately $2.06. This is a slight decrease from the range previously provided. As mentioned, due to the impact of Hurricane Florence and to reflect a bit of sluggishness in today's markets.","Finally, you might remember that when we announced the CalAtlantic application, we noted that we would provide preliminary guidance for our core homebuilding business for fiscal 2019 on this call. So, as we think about deliveries, we expect to deliver approximately 53,000 homes in fiscal 2019. This would be an increase of about 15% from forecasted deliveries in 2018 and an 8% increase in pro forma deliveries for 2018. This is consistent with our previously stated strategic growth range of 7% to 10%.","We believe our gross margins will be in the range of 21.75% to 22%, as we continue to move in the direction of optioning more land and producing higher returns. We expect our SG&A to be about 8.4%, as we continue to drive efficiencies in our operations. So in conclusion, with those goals in mind, we're well positioned to deliver another strong and profitable year in \u201918 and look forward to a great 2019.","And now, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have a question coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.","Stephen Kim","Thanks for all the commentary and the guidance and good job on the quarter. I do want to ask you a little bit about the land agreements you\u2019ve struck with the three regional developers. You mentioned, I'm trying to get a sense for what is really different between what you've done here versus what you have done on an ongoing basis in your history. You indicated there\u2019s exclusive assets, I guess to the 55,000 homes sites, but you didn't mention anything about the terms as far as I heard and I was curious if you've given any guarantees, if you could talk a little bit about what the timing of the cash flows might be in terms of the amount of deposits you put down and other things like that that might be relevant to helping us frame how these arrangements might be a bit different from what you've done in the past?","Rick Beckwitt","So Steve, it\u2019s Rick. At this point, we're not going to get into a lot of the details associated with those agreements, because they're confidential at this point. And -- but I can tell you, there are no guarantees. These are very strategic, well-crafted structures that really guarantee us pipeline that these guys develop. And I can't go into a lot of the details at this point. As we move forward, we\u2019ll give you a little bit more color as to what the structure of the deals are, but it's confidential at this point and for competitive reasons I don't want to get into it.","Stuart Miller","But, the two things I would note Steve are, this is the beginning of the reflection of using size and scale in local markets to be able to comfortably absorb what some of the better developers are bringing in their pipeline to market. And it is also reflective of ours -- continuation of our soft pivot to migrate towards fewer home sites purchased for longer period of times on book and using strength and relationship with proven actors in the land market to have more of a just-in-time delivery system for home sites with a greater focus on returns on assets.","Jon Jaffe","Steve, this is Jon. One other thought on this, and I've talked about it, it's really another reflection of our position where we have dominant market share of being the builder of choice for land developers. So they know and they've discussed with us that we're going to be the dominant buyer of their land and so it's getting ahead of that and figuring out a structure that allows us to control what they'll be delivering in the future for them to know that their pipeline will be absorbed by us in a structure that creates a true win-win situation along the lines of what Stuart and Rick described.","Stephen Kim","Yeah. Sure. It absolutely makes sense. Well, great, well, we look forward to getting more info on that as it comes. I guess my second question related to the guidance you gave and in particular, Diane, I think, you had mentioned a gross margin number, 21.75% to 22%. And earlier, Jon had mentioned about, I think, 70 basis point benefit roughly, given the $3,000 benefit in the first and second quarters from lumber. I was curious to what degree your guidance of 21.75% to 22% incorporates an assumption that the lumber prices remain where they are for the remainder of next year, if you could give us some sense of what kind of lumber contribution is embedded in that guidance? ","And also, if there is -- I was a little surprised that you mentioned that the option strategy was going to be manifested in the gross margin next year. I was a little surprised that it would happened that quickly, so maybe if you could just kind of elaborate on why the -- why you call that one out as a driver to the gross margin being a little lower than it otherwise would've been.","Stuart Miller","Let me start here, Steve. I think Rick wants to chime in after, but let me just say that, one of the -- we've not generally given guidance for the next year until the fourth quarter. So, one of the problems with getting out a little bit farther ahead and we do want to give guidance and give some direction, as the combination has brought some increased question or discussion around where we're going. But those numbers are moving around a little bit, so you very accurately highlight the flow through of the lumber numbers and how a migration towards more options might flow through those numbers. Right now, it's an imperfect calculation and so we\u2019ll refine those numbers as we go forward, but directionally, we wanted to give you a fairly decent understanding of where we see ourselves headed, given current market conditions and given a best assessment of what we see for the next year. Rick?","Rick Beckwitt","Yeah. And I guess in addition to that, the soft pivot strategy has been going on for several quarters now. We have -- we mentioned on prior calls that as we utilize more third party retail option type structures that the gross margin associated with that is a much lower margin, but a higher IRR. So, you're starting to see some of that kick in in 2019. In addition, the deals that I outlined included with them, a immediate position in the portfolio that these guys are developing. So it's not that's just the future deals, it's their current pipeline. So that's why we\u2019ve put in about 25 bps of margin differential from where we were prior.","Operator","We have a question coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut","First question, I just wanted to get a sense a little bit on your comments around some of the slowdown that occurred during the quarter, as you looked at your order trends. I don't know if there's an ability to kind of give us a sense of the organic growth, how that tracked throughout the quarter, if there's a sense of month to month of the 11%, was it stronger in the first month or two and below that rate in the last month.","And also, if I just heard correctly that you expect the orders for 4Q to be 11,400. I think that was only a 200 unit decrease, which seems relatively mild.","Rick Beckwitt","So let's just talk about the quarter. I think we saw sequential improvement month to month throughout the quarter. And when you're talking about whether it's organic or not organic, we're comparing to pro forma numbers. So organic -- it was all organic.","With regard to the Q4 lowering of a couple of hundred home -- new order on the home site, that's a contribution of some homes having slipped because of the storm, the hurricane into Q4 that we lost in Q3, but also some delay associated with the storm going forward. So it's, I think, what we feel relatively positive about the market, as Stuart and Jon said, the market has paused a little bit, but we're seeing consistent normalized demand.","Jon Jaffe","If you think about Michael, in some of the markets, as I articulated, when you're at a pace above five sales per community per month, that's really not sustainable. You're going to run into resistance at some point and where it has shifted to is a very normal rate. In some cases, above that level for that one a week that we sort of strive for as ideal in many of our markets. So, there is \u2013 on a relative basis, right, a slowing, but when you step back and look at it, it's a very healthy, sustainable rate that we're at right now.","Michael Rehaut","No, no. I appreciate that Jon. I guess secondly, and I realize, Stuart, as you said, it's kind of an early number and probably you will be sharpening the pencil perhaps over the next three months ahead of your 4Q call. But I think a lot of people will be focusing, as Steve before was asking around the 2019 gross margin number. And I think it was helpful, I believe, Rick that you mentioned that perhaps the higher level of optioning might be a 25 bp headwind. You also have an expected roughly 100 bp tailwind from increased synergies, that roughly 220 million as well as some tailwind from lumber. So the offsetting headwind I guess is what I'm trying to get my head around, when you think about the fact that 2018 will be 22% or a little bit below 22% gross margin ex purchase accounting if I have that math right. Where is the other offset? Is it mix? Is it higher priced land coming through? The difference more perhaps, either -- again mix being either geographic or demographic, any help there would be helpful?","Jon Jaffe","Michael, it\u2019s Jon. Relative to gross margin, mix it not the major driver there, but we do see that we\u2019re in an environment where it's constrained relative to land and labor. So, you do have year-over-year flowing through higher land cost and higher direct construction costs. So with Lennar, you have a story of what's happened in the marketplace relative to that constraint, offset by synergy savings to marketplace benefit of what's happening with lumber that will show up in the first half of next year. So you have, as you know, both headwinds and tailwinds. So I\u2019m balancing as we forecast a long time ago, we felt that post-merger would be around 22% gross margins with the benefit of the synergies. And so I think you see all of those components, both headwinds and tailwinds reflecting in that preliminary guidance that we gave.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Schrier of Citi.","Scott Schrier","I appreciate all the color that you gave earlier in the call regarding California. I'm just curious if I can dig a little bit deeper into it, obviously, your ASP growth there was exceptional. Can you speak to the role that mix had there? And then if you're talking about how you had this temporary slowdown, you had absorption slow, is some of the reason there behind tax and if so, when you expect this to pick up again, do you expect to pick it up again after absorptions pick up again at the expense of ASP growth or do you look at this as sustainable.","Stuart Miller","There's not a one size fits all answer to that. In some cases, the ASP change is mix, as I tried to highlight in that Orange County example. And in many -- most cases, it's really just price appreciation in local markets, market like Seattle that's been driven by tremendous job growth. You just had year-over-year price acceleration, in the Bay Area, with the boom in the tech world, you've seen year-over-year price appreciation. So, you have both things going on, but more price appreciation than mix.","As far as being able to look forward and predict when we'll see pace increase, that's very hard to do. What we see is we see demand, we see people with lot of interest, we see people pausing as we all have said and just not having the urgency to buy now. So we don't want to suggest that people have left the marketplace or have lost interest in purchasing. It's more that they're stepping back and as we've seen in past market cycles, adjusting to new pricing, which results in a higher monthly mortgage payment. And if people adjust to that, we expect that they'll come back in to the marketplace.","Rick Beckwitt","Yeah. Embedded in your question, you asked about the tax effect and I think that as we look at the market right now and take its temperature, I think that we would say that you're seeing more impact from just price and interest rate migration and adjustment to where the market has gone than any discernible connection between a lack of demand or change in demand pattern, relative to where tax rates have moved and any impact in California, we just haven't seen that yet, not in our price ranges.","Scott Schrier","And just for my follow up, I'd like to round out that discussion on some of your other main areas, if you could just talk about absorption trends, directionally in areas like Texas and Florida that would be great.","Rick Beckwitt","So, if you look at our other major markets, which are really Texas and Florida, I would tell you that we had strong performance in those markets. Texas was up significantly year-over-year, almost 20% in new orders as a whole state. We look at Florida, the Florida markets continue to be robust. That said, there are, in the Dallas market, at the higher, the price points that market has gotten a little bit softer, but really across the board, it's your sub $3000 in price point, it's a very strong market. And we saw continued strengthen in Florida, so you know pretty much across the board, other than on the West Coast, where there was a little bit of softness, as prices have increased dramatically, we feel that we're in a relatively normalized market right now.","Operator","And our next question is from Stephen East of Wells Fargo.","Paul Przybylski","Actually, this is Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. Considering the new demand environment, is your focus more on orders or margin and as kind of have this pause, do you think the industry is maybe protecting that backlog right now and the stock has continued until the fourth quarter that we may actually see industry move to even higher incentives?","Rick Beckwitt","Well, as you saw during the quarter, we really didn't increase the incentives for Q3. We\u2019re","very focused on converting our backlog into revenue. As we do, we're focused every quarter and as we run the business, as we talk about in the past, we are constantly balancing sales pace and margin. There are dynamic pricing models that Jon has really led the company.","Jon Jaffe","Yeah. As we've talked before, it's really a market by market, community by community analysis, relative to price and pace and we make that decision very, very locally. And with respect to backlog, we're not talking about a market shift that would cause us or any other builder, I think, to be concerned about their backlog. What we're talking about is just a market that has, on a relative basis, shifted from very strong to more normalized paced in the cases that we're talking about. ","Stuart Miller","Let me circle back to something that I highlighted in my comments, because I think it is kind of a direct answer to the question, which is our view is that the market has kind of reacted to price and rates having moved fairly dramatically over the past quarters and years. But we go back and we constantly look at the production pace that we've seen over the past years. The constraint of land and labor that is well documented that has narrowed the funnel through which supply shortage could be addressed and can be addressed and we look at the normalized demand level for the country and though some might argue that 1.5 million isn't the same as it used to be, we've been producing at a significantly lower level for the better part of the past decade. ","So we've been building pent up demand. I think our view and I think generally the industry view is that embedded in these numbers, there is a demand pattern and basic economic strength underlying it that will help correct and drive the market forward. So I would say, pretty aggressively that we're not protecting backlog and certainly nothing reflective of what we've seen in past cycles. Instead, I think there's a pause. I think, there's a catch up and I think that will, with economic drivers driving forward, see a resumption of or a normalization of the patterns going forward.","Paul Przybylski","And just as a follow-up on the integration or synergy savings, you're referring that? Are there any risks or upside potential you see moving forward?","Rick Beckwitt","We feel, as I said, pretty comfortable. We have a lot of clarity to the synergies that we've identified. There's a lot of work to do to realize them, but we've seen that come into place relative to 2018 as we're in our last quarter of 2018, we feel that those are very much locked and loaded, agreements are in place with national vendors that will carry it through the full year of 2019. So, I don't see a lot of risk. Is there upside? There's always the potential for upside, as we dig deeper into it and one synergy builds on the next, but for us, the focus is the day-to-day blocking and tackling of executing on what we've identified and making sure that we deliver on that.","Operator","And we have a question from Alan Ratner of Zelman and Associates.","Stuart Miller","Okay. And we\u2019ll make this the last question. Go ahead, Alan.","Alan Ratner","Thanks for squeezing me in here and nice job, given the choppier environment of late. I think, taking a step back, if mid to high single digit growth is bad as it's going to get, it\u2019s certainly not draconian view that the market seems to be expressing right now. But, just as far as what you're seeing as far as the deceleration, is there any notable differences you're seeing across the various price points you build out? I know, you gave the geographic exposure, but any main differences you're seeing across your buyer pools and does that impact how you're thinking about land investment today as far as maybe shifting the portfolio subtly over the next couple of years.","Rick Beckwitt","Well, sort of on a general basis and there are some exceptions. At the higher price points, it's gotten a little bit softer than the lower price points had been. And that's not unusual in a market that there's a lot of publicity as to what's going on in mortgage rates and price appreciation, because the more fluent buyer time their purchase based on where they think the world is going. And so, we think, as we said consistently that this is just a market adjustment to a more normalized market from what was really a red hot market in some of these markets. ","With regard to land and our land strategy, we have consistently said for the last year that we've been shifting a lot of our land investment to the entry level and that first time move up buyer, because it's the fat of the market and our teams have been focused on making investments in that area.","Alan Ratner","And then, I think on the capital allocation side, you mention share repurchase activity potential, which I think makes a lot of sense at the current levels. One thing I don't think you mentioned was the possibility of more M&A and I know while it's no fun to see stock prices go down, you guys have historically been very opportunistic on the M&A front during periods of disruption in the equity markets. So, just kind of curious how you're thinking about the possibility of doing another deal, now that the CalAtlantic integration is behind you and are there any interesting opportunities, either public or private, starting to pop up now, given some of the pullback in the share prices.","Rick Beckwitt","Well, Alan, as you can imagine, we probably won't comment too deeply on the answer to that question, but you know us. Number one, everything is on the table and from our company's perspective, we love a bargain, we're very opportunistic and always have been, we're always focused on competing alternatives. We are -- we have highlighted that we've been very cash flow focused. We've really positioned our balance sheet very well. Diane's done a great job of managing our capital allocation and programming to date. We sit with an excellent balance sheet in just a short time after completing a transaction and integration complete, it really positions us to look at organic growth, at M&A, should there be unique opportunities, but everything measured against the most obvious bargain, which is the group of assets that we know best, the group of assets that we control, the least form of friction and that is buying back stock.","So as we sit here today, and we look at the capital markets, not enamored with the home building sector, as we look at the landscape with the growth rates as we see them today and the production deficit as we see that -- as we see it today and as tomorrow we have our board meeting and we sit and talk to our board for advice, very much on the table is the question of allocating capital in balance between paying down debt and buying back stock as against some of those other alternatives. So never think for a minute that anything is off the table with Lennar. We love a good bargain and this is an environment where you start to find them.","Rick Beckwitt","Okay. So with that, we'll wrap up. Thanks for joining us and we look forward to updating again for our fourth quarter and into 2019. Thank you everyone.","Operator","Thank you and that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."],"13488":["Lennar Corp.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart Miller","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our first quarter update. This morning, I\u2019m joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you\u2019ve just heard from; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt here with me this morning, who is our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto, both joining for the Q&A session. We also have Eric Feder here who facilitates our deal flow across our operating platforms and whose birthday it is today and he will join us for Q&A today as well, Happy Birthday, Eric; and Jon Jaffe is available by telephone. He is our Chief Operating Officer and he is in California.","As is customary on our conference call, I want to begin this morning with some brief overview remarks on the housing market and then briefly overview our operation. And then Bruce is going to provide greater detail on our numbers and some additional comments on financial services segment. And then as always, we will open up to Q&A. As in the past we\u2019d like to request that during the Q&A session each person limit themselves to one question and one follow-up.","So let me go ahead and begin and let me begin by saying that we are very pleased to report that we\u2019ve been able to begin our 2014 year with a solid first quarter start. Our company is very well-positioned to be able to continue to perform extremely well due to our well-crafted strategy and tied to a clear view of general market conditions.","In our year end and fourth quarter conference call, we reported to you that we have seen a clear pause in the rate of recovery in the housing market and while prices had continue to appreciate volume had clearly subsided.","In the first quarter, we have seen clear signs that volume is returning to the market, even as severe weather made conditions difficult. As we moved past the seasonally slowest month of the year end, we began to see both traffic and sales volume begin a steady month-by-month improvement throughout the quarter.","The progression through our fourth quarter of 2013 and into our first quarter of 2014 continues to fuel our confidence and our belief that the housing market recovery continues as we begin to enter the more vibrant seasonal month of the year.","We continue to believe that the fundamental drivers of improvement in the housing market remain a steadily improving economy with a slowly improving employment picture unlocking pent-up demand, while supplies remain constrained to meet that demand.","We continue to believe that there remains a production deficit of both single-family and multifamily dwellings from underproduction during the economic downturn and up to an including last year. This shortfall will continue to define the housing markets for the foreseeable future and will drive the housing recovery forward.","Accordingly, the builders of both multi and single-family products will continue to increase production as inventories have remained extremely low and pent-up demand comes to the market. And even as the market respond, inventories are likely to remain constrained as production increases are limited by shortage of entitled and developed land to build on in desirable location.","While we recognize the potential headwind from a constrained and sometimes uncertain mortgage market, including interest rate volatility and sometimes volatile consumer confidence and also diminishing investment purchasers in the retail market. We feel that the fundamentals of short supply of available home and pent-up demand will continue to define our strategy of land acquisition and growth and drive the recovery forward.","Against that backdrop, Lennar has begun 2014 with very solid first quarter results as each of our business -- businesses showed strong performance in the first quarter and are well-positioned for the future. This speaks both to the solid management execution of our articulated strategies and to the positioning of our company for continued performance throughout the year.","Now homebuilding, of course, remains the primary driver of our quarterly performance. For the first quarter, homebuilding revenues grew to $1.2 billion, up 42% over last year, as we continue to focus on maximizing pricing power. Deliveries were up some 13% over the prior year.","Our sales pace in the first quarter averaged 2.8 sales per community per month, which was essentially flat compared to last year. We opened 60 new communities and closed out 49 during the quarter to end at 548 active communities, which is a 13% year-over-year increase.","And our absorption pace in sales improved sequentially through the quarter with the sales in the quarter up 10%, while new order dollar value was up 26%. In the West, where we were not impacted by weather and where we were able to open new communities, our sales were up 45% year-over-year and 40% -- and 47% on the community count growth. Our Western operations made up for some of the markets that were hardest hit by severe weather conditions during the quarter.","We continue to focus on maximizing our pricing power. Our average sales price is $316,000 was a year-over-year increase of $47,000 or 18% and a 3% sequential increase from the fourth quarter. This improvement in sales prices covers our increases in labor, materials and land cost, improving our gross margins by 300 basis points to year -- 300 basis points year-over-year to 25.1%.","Year-over-year, labor and material costs are up 9.8% to over $47 a square foot and sequentially this is less than a 1% increase from the fourth quarter as lower lumber prices from previous quarters were reflected in this quarters result.","We continue, however, to see cost increases in some of the materially -- material, most notably, drywall, lumber and siding that will begin to impact our second quarter deliveries. However, we did see an easing on the labor pressure in many other markets.","With SG&A of 11.8%, we continue to improve our operating leverage, as this is 20 basis point year-over-year improvement. This operating leverage combined with our pricing power produced a 13.2% net operating margin for the quarter and -- which is a 310 basis point improvement year-over-year.","We\u2019ve continued our focus on cost effective marketing with total Lennar online visits in Q1 increasing 39% year-over-year and this quarter we also surpassed over 1 million social media followers.","I\u2019d like to also point out that our bottom line performance has greatly benefited from the execution on our NextGen product strategy. Year-over-year, sales of our multigenerational brand grew by 57% and accounted for 5% of our new orders in Q1. We now offer our NextGen plan in 178 communities across the country and in Q1 the average sales price for NextGen was about $450,000.","During the fourth quarter, we continued our carefully crafted land acquisition program and purchased approximately 8,800 homesites for $505 million, while we spent $226 million on land development for the future.","Combined, our land acquisition and land development spend was up about 33% over the prior year period. As in prior quarters, money was invested geographically in the markets where we saw the best opportunities and the best returns.","As quarter end, we owned and controlled approximately 154,000 homesites and as I mentioned before, had 548 active communities. As we noted in our last conference call, we expect to be able to increase community count by approximately 15% over the course of 2014.","As we look ahead to 2014 and beyond, we are fortunate to -- to the remainder of 2014 and beyond, we are fortunate to have land in hand to meet our projected deliveries through this year and for all of next year and this positions us very well to maintain gross margins that are consistent with our first -- reported first quarter margin for the remainder of the year.","Our fourth quarter performance highlights very strong management execution, but also indicate how well-positioned we are for future performance driven strong -- by strong operating strategy, complemented by an excellent management team and excellent management execution.","Complementing our homebuilding operations, our financial services segment continues to build its primary business alongside the homebuilder and its working to replace the now diminished refi business with a vibrant retail business across our national footprint. Bruce will talk more about financial services progress which had a very respectable quarter with operating earnings of $4.5 million though down from $16.1 million last year when the refi business was thriving.","While our Homebuilding and Financial Services division are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our three additional operating divisions are all continuing to mature as excellent longer-term value creation platforms for the company. Rialto continues to make significant progress in transitioning from an asset heavy balance sheet investor to a capital wide investment manager, commercial loan originator and securitizer.","Rialto today is involved in three different businesses. Our first is the direct investment business where we were able to return or will return shortly over $120 million in cash to the partners in those initial investments, including almost $50 million to Rialto. Our goal is to monetize the bulk of these assets by the end of 2016, generating over $400 million of cash for us to recycle.","The second area is our growing investment management and servicing platform. Our objective here is to grow our assets under management and create value for investors. We\u2019re continuing to build upon the base established with our first real estate fund and during the quarter, we completed the race for Rialto Real Estate Fund II closing out with $1.3 billion of equity commitments.","And Fund II is already invested or committed to invest approximately $700 million in approximately 50 transactions and has started making distributions of income to investors as well. We expect to begin raising our third real estate fund later this year.","And finally our third business is Rialto Mortgage Finance, our high return on equity conduit lending platform. RMF as we refer to it, is focused on originating and securitizing long-term fixed rate loans on stabilized cash flow and commercial real estate properties.","During the first quarter, we completed our fifth and sixth securitization transactions selling an additional $250 million of RMF originated loans bringing the total to almost $1 billion in only our first two quarters of securitization activity. In the first quarter, Rialto exceeded our breakeven expectations with a $2.6 million profit and is well positioned for a strong 2014.","As with Rialto, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress of our multi-family apartment business. As we\u2019ve noted in the past, this business began operations in early 2011 and is positioned to be one of the leading developers on new Class A apartments in the United States.","As homeownership rates have drifted downward and the large millennial generation begins to lead home and form households, this strategy continues to be an excellent complement to our primary for-sale homebuilding business.","During the first quarter, we started development and construction on three additional apartment communities. We now have 15 communities of which two are completed and operating and two are partially completed and leasing. And the remaining 11 are under construction.","These 15 communities have approximately 4,000 apartments with an estimated development cost of approximately $835 million. In addition to these communities, we have a geographic re-diversified pipeline that exceeds $2.8 billion and represents an additional 11,600 apartments.","As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, we are building these apartments with third-party institutional capital and each deal has been conservatively financed with non-recourse debt. With our conservative financing and our conservative underwriting, we are positioned to earn IRRs exceeding 25% and cash multiples greater than two times.","We anticipate with the construction -- we anticipate that the construction of our development pipeline will be completed over the next four years. Finally, our FivePoint Communities program continues to mature as a long-term strategy as well and is quickly moving to bring developed land in our premium California locations to the market to fill the growing demand for well located, approved and developed home sites.","Overall and in summary, our company is extremely well positioned to succeed in the current market conditions. We have an excellent management team that\u2019s focused on a carefully crafted strategy that has positioned us with advantage to assets that will continue to drive industry-leading profitability.","Additionally we have a well-diversified platform that will continue to enhance shareholder value as our ancillary businesses mature. We are very pleased with our progress and performance -- we\u2019re very pleased with our progress and performance in the first quarter and we look forward to reporting progress on a very successful 2014 year ahead.","With that, let me turn over to Bruce.","Bruce Gross","Thanks Stuart and good morning. Our net earnings for the first quarter were $0.35 per diluted share versus $0.26 in the prior year. Our earnings before income taxes were $126 million which was an increase of 136% over the prior year.","Let me add a little color to the numbers starting with Homebuilding. The 13% increase in deliveries resulted in a backlog conversion ratio of 75% for the quarter. This was within our previously announced goal for the quarter despite the tough weather conditions that Stuart mentioned.","The 18% increase in average sales price to $316,000 is broken down by region as follows. The East region was $279,000, up 11%. Southeast Florida was $341,000, up 26%. Central region was $266,000, up 3%. Houston was $278,000, up 8%. The West region was 413,000, this was up 41% and although they had a sizable increase in average sales price, they also benefited from some favorable product mix. The other region was $385,000, up 13%.","Our gross margin on home sales which Stuart highlighted was up 300 basis points to 25.1%. This improvement was driven by a couple of things. Sales incentives were $21,300 per home in the quarter and that was a year-over-year improvement of 170 basis points.","It came down from 8% in the prior year to 6.3% as a percentage of the home price. The gross margin percentage improved in the East, Southeast Florida, Houston and West regions during the quarter and the highest gross margin was in the Southeast Florida region.","Additionally during the quarter, we received an insurance settlement totaling $5.5 million, which favorably impacted the gross margins. In addition to the significant operating leverage mentioned earlier, we have additionally recognized operating leverage in our corporate G&A line as our corporate G&A improved 40 basis points to 2.8% and this is as a percentage of total revenues.","During the quarter, we closed $91 million of land sales totaling $16 million of profit. $65 million of these land sales were from mothballed assets which were strategically sold to redeploy the capital into near-term producing assets with favorable operating margins.","Additionally in one of these sales, Lennar will be the developer and will earn approximately $7 million in fees over two-year period starting in 2015. Our ending community count increased to 548. However, there were about 16 communities that were shifted into Q2 as a result of a delay due to weather conditions.","Turning to Financial Services. This segment generated operating earnings of $4.5 million versus $16.1 million in the prior year. This is in line with our year end conference call comments that we expected Financial Services earnings to be below $5 million for the first quarter.","Mortgage pretax income decreased to $6.5 million from $16.4 million in the prior year. The decrease in profitability was primarily due to an 83% decrease in refinance loan origination volumes which also resulted in margin compression as more competitors focused on the purchase business.","Mortgage originations declined 25% from the prior year to approximately $900 million and we captured 75% of Lennar homebuyers using mortgages for their purchase. Our title companies also experienced a significant reduction in refinanced transactions and in this quarter, which is the seasonally slowest quarter of the year, they had $1.6 million loss compared with $300,000 profit in the prior year.","Turning to the Rialto segment. They generated operating earnings of $2.6 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior year. Both of these amounts are net of non-controlling interest.","The composition of Rialto\u2019s operating earnings by the three types of investments are as follows, the direct investments which is the FDIC and bank portfolios had a net loss of $1.6 million, the investment management business contributed $5.8 million of earnings and these numbers don\u2019t improve the carried interest which are under a hypothetical liquidation, increased by $9 million for the quarter and is now at $90 million. We expect this number to continue to grow and isn\u2019t recognized as income until proceeds are actually received.","Our new Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $253 million of commercial loans into two securitizations, resulting in the earnings of $3.1 million for the quarter and this is net of their respective G&A. Additionally, there was $1.1 million of management fees, which is net of remaining Rialto, G&A and others.","Interest expense for the quarter increased to $5.7 million due to the issuance of $250 million of senior notes in the fourth quarter. Our Rialto balance sheet is very well positioned today.","They ended the quarter with $169 million of cash and subsequent to the quarter end, we completed a $100 million add-on to the initial $250 million five year unsecured notes that we closed at the end of last year. This add-on was done at an effective interest rate of 6.31%. The Multifamily segment results for the quarter are consistent with expectations, as we have met start-up operating expenses of $6.2 million.","Our balance sheet liquidity is strong. We ended the first quarter with $646 million of Homebuilding cash and no outstanding borrowings under our $950 million unsecured revolving credit facility. We issued $500 million of senior notes due June 2019 in the quarter. This reduces our borrowing cost and also fits well into our debt maturity ladder.","Our Homebuilding net debt to total cap was 48.5% and we received positive outlook upgrades from both S&P and Moody\u2019s during the first quarter. Our book value per share at the end of the quarter increased to $20.84.","Finally, let me summarized what we said on this call and revisit the 2014 goals from our year end conference calls. First, with deliveries, we are maintaining our goal to deliver between 21,000 and 22,000 in homes for 2014. We are also maintaining our backlog conversion ratio expectations, which is between 80% and 85% for both Q2 and Q3 and we expect to be over 90% for Q4.","Next, our gross margin expectations are to still average 25% for the full year, with the fourth quarter being higher than the second and third quarter of this year. Our first quarter gross margin percentages were benefited by approximately 50 basis points due to the insurance settlement highlighted earlier.","SG&A, we continued to focus on leveraging this line and expect about 25 basis points of potential improvements throughout the year, same as we said at year end. Financial Services earnings are still expected to be in the $65 million to $75 million range for the full year and it\u2019s more heavily weighted to the second half of the year.","Rialto still expects profits between $30 million and 40 million for the year and those profits are also more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Multifamily still expects start-up losses of $15 million to $20 million for the year and this includes one or two apartment community sales that are possible later this year.","Our joint venture and land sale category, we do not expect any significant sales for the remainder of the year, so we expect to be about breakeven for these two categories. And our 2014 effective tax rate is now expected to be about 37%. Net community count for the year, we still expect to end the year in a range of 600 to 625, even though we had a delay of about 16 communities into our second quarter.","So with that, let me turn it over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Good morning and very happy birthday wishes to Eric. Big picture, Stuart, you have a very solid quarter and you talked about the sequential improvement in pricing. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and any change in your view of builders increasing incentives as they are not seeing sales pace and how it impacts your business?","And then just on the bigger picture basis, you had highlighted that your current operating divisions, I think you had said are roughly 30 and the comparison, I think was over a 100 at the peak. How do you operate as you grow with such a lean infrastructure? And is there opportunity to improve SG&A significantly better than where you are today?","Stuart Miller","Ivy, I\u2019m going to let Rick and then, Jon lay in on those two questions.","Rick Beckwitt","From a competitive standpoint, Ivy, the market has ceded up a little bit, partially driven by the fact that there were some weather issues and builders were trying to move inventory close to the end of their quarters, depending on where their quarters were. We\u2019re benefiting from the fact that there is not a lot of inventory out there for sale. So the issues aren\u2019t that pronounced at this point.","We did not increase significantly any incentives throughout the quarter as you can see in our numbers, although there are some folks out there that are pushing the number in order to move some inventory. But we\u2019re not alarmed by that. We think that our communities are really well located or in decent places. We\u2019ve got a good mix of build jobs as well as things moving through the construction cycle. So, we are really pleased with where we have inventory and how things are priced.","We have seen a little bit of slowdown in price increases as we\u2019ve moved through the year. Prices ran real quick. And so to the extent that there are incentives, it\u2019s sort of balanced between maybe not moving the price up as much as taking something away. Jon, your thoughts?","Jon Jaffe","I would echo what Rick said. There are some isolated cases where competitive incentives are kicked in and particularly if you look at Phoenix or Las Vegas, but we\u2019re well positioned. And we\u2019re focused on really margin over maintaining a pace where there might be those incentives. In the most part, the west has been relatively light in incentives because it\u2019s so land constrained. If you look at the west, it hovers around 3% as compared to the company average of just over 6%.","And we feel that we\u2019re very well positioned as we move forward with our community locations, product type. And as well, I would add our EI platform gives us a differentiation that allows us to, I think hold our prices more stable. With respect to the growth in leveraging our -- the way we structured our divisions, I think we learned a lot during the downturn and are very well positioned to be able to leverage that and continue to grow our community count with adding very little in the way of division management. We\u2019ll clearly add out in the field in construction and sales as we add community count. But we see the need to add very little in terms of additional operational groups to be able to grow year-over-year effectively.","Rick Beckwitt","Yeah. And just to add to that, Ivy, from an organizational standpoint, keep in mind, we at the peak of the market were running this thing with nine regions. We\u2019ve got four today. We had 100 plus operating divisions. And while we\u2019re at 30, as some of the markets get a little bit bigger, let\u2019s just use South Florida.","We\u2019re probably going to split South Florida into two pieces because it\u2019s gotten so large. But given the fact that we\u2019ve structured this pretty efficiently with product strategy and where things are getting purchased from a regional standpoint. We think we can keep the overhead real well in control and get some operating leverage.","Stuart Miller","And let me add one more point here. And that is, as we went through the downturn, we consolidated divisions in a number of ways. We combined some geographies. Some of those geographies will be unbound, but we were also running two platforms in almost every market. We were running an Everything\u2019s Included in a designed studio platform across the country. And it was really a pretty inefficient way of running, but hard to unwind while the market was ceded. The downturn in the market really enabled us to unify under a single platform.","We today have a well crafted EI program that has adapted to each local market. Rick and Jon work together and across our platform to really carefully craft the strategy as a one division market strategy for each unique geography and that marketing platform is very efficient today. So, while there will be some unwinding of some of the geographic doubling up, it will be minor in comparison to the efficiencies that we\u2019ve created by operating under a singular platform that\u2019s really carefully crafted for each market.","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning. Stuart, I know historically you\u2019ve said credit is loosening, but maybe very, very slowly. And it will take some time before we look back and look back a couple of years and see that action. Seems to me the biggest hurdle is regulatory certainty, so maybe what or maybe some specific, what are you doing and maybe a little bit more about what the industry doing is, maybe to get a thought of Mel Watt? Or for whoever else, potentially gets some more regulatory certainty in the market, maybe not such big things as GSE reform, but maybe some other things on the margin that the industry could potentially do to get things moved on a little more quickly? I would love your thoughts on that.","Stuart Miller","Well, it\u2019s a good question. And let me say first of all that the industry is not just working on and getting in front of Mel Watt, but all of the participants in the discussion both in Congress and the Administration and making sure that we are heard and that the pitfalls of rapid change is not carefully thought out that doesn\u2019t properly regard the plumbing system that\u2019s in place should be of great concern. So when I say the industry, I mean, I\u2019m included in that, but most of the CEOs are working together within the industry to make sure that the industry\u2019s voices heard.","So what are we doing other than trying to make sure that our voices are heard? I think a lot of the same things that investors and analysts and others are doing and that is we\u2019re going to have to wait and see what actually does shake out. I know that we\u2019ve seen some initial readings from the Senate, I guess Finance Committee or Banking Committee that has already approved GSE reform in a sense, but it\u2019s a long way until those reforms are adopted by both houses of Congress and actually move forward.","A lot of people think that there might not be much movement this year and maybe not for a couple of years. We will have to wait and see. What we have seen though in the field is that the margins credit has been reverting to more normalized levels in the very slow kind of orderly fashion. I will say that mortgage approval and tight money is a constraint to opening up demand and bringing demand to the marketplace, but at the margins and over time, I think we are seeing that reversion to normal.","So you kind of have to sit back and rely on the fact that let the Administration and Congress understand how vital housing is to economic recovery and rely on the fact they probably won\u2019t do something that materially alters the landscape and we will continue to see that reversion to normal as we go forward. That\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it and incorporating that thinking into our business strategy.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs","Great, thanks. And then maybe just one quick follow-up. Just curious about how you view your ability in terms of one of the only companies to grow substantially in the last -- how you\u2019re able to do that? And then quickly just curious about the South Florida decline there, maybe that just community count driven but was curious on that? Thank you very much.","Stuart Miller","Okay. On California, Jon, why don\u2019t you weigh in and Rick why don\u2019t you take these?","Jon Jaffe","Sure. Hi, Eli. In California and West, in general, we\u2019ve got out early and aggressive as we talked about on prior calls with our land acquisition strategy and positioned our ourselves for strong community count growth year-over-year, \u201813 over \u201812, \u201814 over \u201813. And what we said today, we are well positioned into \u201815, \u201816 and even into 2017. So it\u2019s really been that strategy of getting out in all the primary markets in California, acquiring some flagship communities to have a stable presence in a lot of the markets as and then adding on to that and position ourselves for significant kind of growth that you\u2019ve seen. So enable us to increase our sales activity 45% in the west and sales price up 37% and that\u2019s on that community count growth of 47%. And we see that growth, I\u2019m not saying at the high level community count but significant as we move forward.","Rick Beckwitt","And with regard to Southeast Florida, that\u2019s really been a conscious effort on our part. We did not want sales to get ahead of us. This is a very strong market here. We\u2019ve been very focused on pricing. We saw during the quarter we were up about 9% in South Florida on pricing. A little bit of it had an impact with regard to the timing of some grand openings that we had last year, particularly in the Doral area, but we are very comfortable with the strategy that we\u2019re executing here. It\u2019s tough, the market that has perhaps the highest margins that we have in the country. We\u2019ve got great land assets and we want to make sure we don\u2019t build through them too quick and building up backlog if we can\u2019t deliver them doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense for us, so we slowed it down.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Go ahead, your line is open.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Stuart Miller","Good morning.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","First question I had was on sales pace. And I think in the press release, it was noted that still maybe a little bit too early to call the spring, but at the same time, obviously, we\u2019re about a month and half in February, obviously contributed to a solid quarter and you have an early look on March. With the comments also about sales pace, I guess, improving sequentially throughout the quarter, I was curious if you could give us a sense of, on a year-over-year basis sales pace was down roughly 4% versus the year ago quarter, if that was different at all intra-quarter? And as you\u2019d kind of with the momentum I guess, or of at least February and into March, if there is any additional comments you might want to provide about your comfort level or confidence about the next couple months?","Stuart Miller","Yes. So Mike, we haven\u2019t gone through the monthly absorption rate. What we did highlight is that we did progress favorably through the quarter. We were pleased as we got into February, but we didn\u2019t get to the specific absorption rates month by month, but we are optimistic with what we are seeing with traffic, traffic improved throughout the quarter as well. Again, that\u2019s a drill down into the numbers exactly. We felt like this is a normal progression through our first quarter going into the spring. We haven\u2019t commented on March. We typically don\u2019t do the intra-quarter commentary, but this is a normal progression that we would expect going into the spring selling season and wait and see what happens for the next three months.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Okay. Appreciate that. I mean, I guess, the second question just on gross margins, not to nitpick too much, but just so, I have -- more than just that I understand correctly your comments earlier Bruce about fourth quarter, you expect fourth quarter gross margins to be better than I believe say 2Q and 3Q. Obviously with the first quarter coming in around 25%, it might imply 2Q or 3Q being a little bit less than that. I just want to know if I\u2019m interpreting that correct. And I know you haven\u2019t really talked about margins beyond this year, but given the high level of margins relative to history, at the same time you have a great backlog of land that might create some above average visibility or sustainability of those margins. How you guys are thinking about margins past 2014?","Bruce Gross","Okay. So let me start with the first part of that question. In the first quarter, just a reminder, we had the benefits from the legal settlement. So excluding that, we\u2019re at 24.6%. We expect Q2 and Q3 to be a little bit higher and therefore, it would likely be below the 25.1%, if you included the legal settlement and then the fourth quarter would likely be higher. So look at the 25% without the legal settlement included.","And then for the second part of the question, we haven\u2019t given any guidance to next year yet, but we do feel really good about the land. As Stuart said earlier, we do have locked and loaded the land for this year, next year. We feel very comfortable with the efficiencies we have in the business. So there is no reason to think that there is a going to be a falloff in the margins at this point. We will continue to update as we go through the year, but we are very encouraged and enthusiastic, as we think ahead into next year.","Stuart Miller","Just to add to that, let me say, as we look ahead to 2015 and \u201816, Mike, we\u2019ve articulated in prior conference calls that we are thinking about volumes. Remember that this recovery has been somewhat different than prior recovery in that it is -- we\u2019ve led this recovery with price increase recovery as opposed to volume recovery. But as we go forward, we suspect that we are going to see volumes increase and it\u2019s altogether possible, but as volumes increase, we will add shorter term, more retail-oriented positions to our land portfolio.","And as we do that that could alter the landscape of margins going forward, that is gross margins in favor of operating margins as we leverage our platform. So we are not going to look too far ahead. Right now, we have a great deal of confidence in our margin composition and where we are going in \u201814 and into \u201815, but that can -- the complexion of that can change and be altered a little bit if we decide to pick up volume by adding some community count. So we don\u2019t really want to give a firm projection, but do want to highlight that we have excellent land positions to carry us into next year.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Great there, much appreciated.","Stuart Miller","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen East with ISI Group. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Stephen East - ISI Group","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Stuart, you all gave us a lot of good information on multifamily, Rialto, et cetera? And we should be able to start to unlock value a little bit more from a modeling perspective? As you sit and look at those businesses and the timelines for monetization, you talked a little bit about potentially selling one or two apartments, but as you all think internally, how do you start to unlock the value from a monetization standpoint and when do you think that starts to occur?","Stuart Miller","Well, as I noted, Steve, these businesses are maturing and maturing right on track. When you look at the apartment business, you\u2019re really starting to see a business that is defining the kind of a recurring program though we\u2019re not quite there yet.","Right now, we have two communities that are completed, two communities that are partially completed and 11 that are under construction. As we look ahead, we\u2019re pretty confident that we\u2019ll start construction on another seven or so this year and maybe even more.","As we start to develop kind of a monthly tracking mechanism and a way of thinking about how long it\u2019s going to take to actually put something online, take it offline and monetize. That\u2019s when we\u2019re going to start to be able to bring visibility to you as the business matures. And more importantly, start to think about what kind of monetization program might be most efficient in creating shareholder value.","Likewise, Rialto is starting to present itself in a more normalized way. We highlighted three business segments, it\u2019s actually really two. The first business segment is the liquidation of our legacy assets. The other two businesses are really starting to perk up and present.","The asset management business is really fortifying itself with assets invested that are starting to generate real returns and perhaps, more importantly, promote that is not realized and as that starts to get realized, the maturity of that business will present itself alongside of our math, which is our make loans and securitize business, which is basically a fee business based on volume.","So over the next year or two we\u2019ll really start to see some visibility come out of those businesses and that visibility will be a stepping stone to getting to some form of monetization.","Stephen East - ISI Group","Okay. Thank you. And then, just going back to the core business, just sort of looking at it, as you talked about this year, you\u2019ve highlighted to some degree that you\u2019ve got a little bit of SG&A leverage, but when I listened to Rick and Jon, it sounds like the potential for the SG&A leverage could jump up quite a bit, if you can get the volumes through the 15% type growth on communities? Just where, do you all think about your business, are you basically there on SG&A leverage or is this a story with some multiyear and we can expect to drive to levels that maybe lower levels that we didn\u2019t see in prior cycles?","Rick Beckwitt","Steve, its Rick. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there quite yet, but it\u2019s coming pretty fast. We were a little bit delaying on the quarter because we had some weather impacts. New community openings, as Bruce highlighted, starts were a little bit impacted by 100 to 150 starts over the quarter.","So it\u2019s going to queue up as we move through the year. But as we said earlier, with regard to the restructuring that was done in the business and our focus on moving towards incremental volume and absorptions in these communities, we think that you\u2019ll see the leverage.","When it comes through it\u2019s, probably, you are not going to see it, you will see sequential improvement as you\u2019ve seen in prior years, but just give us a little bit of time and you will reach the benefit from that.","Stuart Miller","Let me just add to that for a second and say that, operating leverage is going to come in a couple of forms, but not just the efficiencies that you\u2019ve already seen but the efficiencies that we continue to be focused on.","We highlighted our digital platform in a small way in our opening remarks. The migration from conventional marketing and advertising to a more digital platform is something that we still think is in its infancy and our business and offers an opportunity to further enhance the operating leverage that we can have by bringing some new systems and programs to our regular platform.","So, I think that, I think, we\u2019re quickly getting to some of the efficiencies that are embedded in what we\u2019ve done. But I think over the next few years, there is opportunity, not just for us, but for others in the industry to really enhance efficiencies by changing the way that we operate our business.","Stephen East - ISI Group","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Kim with Barclays. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","Great. Thanks a lot guys. Another strong quarter, congratulations on that. I wanted to just start off just little bit comment, which I think, Mike, earlier was trying to get at, which is that he just made an observation that sort of things in the fourth quarter were a little bit softer in terms of the demand side and the progression now with, of course, the first quarter was kind of normal sequentially and so if that would be the -- what you described the implication might be that, if things are still a little bit not as good as maybe things had been in the past? So I just throw that out in terms of an observation there maybe something getting lost in translation, because I\u2019m sort of hearing from your body language the things are good but not great, they\u2019re certainly not bad, you used the word optimistic which can mean a lot of different things?","But my question actually relates to the first time buyer. You and many other builders have sort of talked about the fact that there is sort of some difficulties in that market, I know you\u2019ve talked about it in the past, it\u2019s sort of not yet fully come into its own yet? And I was curious as to when you think that market, that buyer type might start coming back into the market in greater format and what you\u2019re doing to prepare for it? And I\u2019m specifically interested in the timing of it and what you\u2019re doing in terms of like the land and things like that to particularly go after that market?","Rick Beckwitt","On the land side, Steve, its Rick. As we said in prior quarters when this question has been brought up, we\u2019ve been focused on securing land positions that are right for this type of buyer. Price point needs to be low. Volumes need to be high, because you\u2019re making a small amount per copy when you\u2019re closing the home. So in order to be in this business, you need to structure as a volume-oriented business because it\u2019s generally skinnier gross margins but rapid pace.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","Right.","Rick Beckwitt","Since we benefit from the fact as that we\u2019ve secured the lion share of our deliveries for \u201814 and \u201815 gives us an opportunity to tap out there and tie-up some pieces of properties, so when this buyer comes out, we\u2019re positioned for it and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done.","Stuart Miller","I would just add to what, Rick said that, we\u2019re also working with the buyers that are first-time buyers and sitting down with them and helping them from a credit counseling perspective. So that we\u2019re helping them to prepare to be able to qualify for a mortgage as that first time market comes back.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","So I just want to make sure that I\u2019m understanding what I heard. So is this your view Rick that your company because of the fact that you\u2019ve been sort of proactive in this and have identified this market as one that\u2019s going to come back, did you already take in steps maybe perhaps more than your competition to position yourself to capture this market when the buyer demand increases there or is this not a strategic focus for you versus your competitors? I\u2019m just trying to understand how important\u2026","Bruce Gross","I\u2019m not going to talk about what the competition is doing because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s particularly relevant to what our investor base is interested in. What I will tell you is that we have made conscious effort to address this as a potential augmented business as the market recovers. Right now, the financing is a little bit tough. There is down payment issues with this type of buyer. But given the demographics and what we know about the market, this market is going to come back.","I think that\u2019s why Stuart foreshadowed earlier in the call that our margins maybe impacted a bit as we pursue a more volume-oriented approach as we capture and expand the business. So we are very focused on it.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","Got it.","Bruce Gross","It\u2019s something that will come, but there has got to be a conscious effort to both tie up the land, build a program and run a business that\u2019s a little bit different than the core business.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","Okay. Got it. Great, that\u2019s actually very clear. Thanks very much for that. The second question I had related to your just another sort of a buyer type, it\u2019s the foreign buyer. I know this isn\u2019t a huge deal for you guys, but in certain of your communities, particularly on the West Coast and in essence, South Florida, it\u2019s kind of like hard to not notice that there is an awful lot of concentration for a particular type of buyer that\u2019s not really making it home, their homes here in the U.S. traditionally, but they are buying property here in the U.S. And I was curious as to whether you could just sort of comment on how are you targeting that buyer?","Are you just sort of creating communities based on what has sold and this buyer is just sort of coming forward or you have to be specifically marketing to a foreign buyer. And then, maybe as sort of a follow on to that is the -- is there any change given the exchange rate because the Chinese yen had weakened pretty considerably against the dollar recently. Have you seen anything on the West Coast? I guess it\u2019s a question for Jon.","Stuart Miller","Yeah, Jon, why don\u2019t you go ahead and take all of that?","Jon Jaffe","Sure. We\u2019re definitely seeing more demand from the Chinese buyer and offshore buyer. But you have to really break it down into its bucket, Steve. It\u2019s -- you have those that are U.S. residents and then you have foreign nationals. And I\u2019d say that the mix has changed over last year, what we\u2019re currently seeing.","You probably have a little bit more weighting towards the foreign national buyer that\u2019s coming in, either all cash or 50% down. We really haven\u2019t seen any change in the demand from that buyer because of currency activity. It\u2019s stayed pretty healthy and you tend to see it in certain markets.","So at San Francisco, in Irvine, L.A., are very strong markets for that buyer profile. And we do selective marketing to that buyer profile for those markets, but we don\u2019t do it for the markets that aren\u2019t as popular for that profile.","Stephen Kim - Barclays","Great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead your line is open.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. This is actually Desi filling in for Bob. You talked about labor and material costs rising by nearly 10% in the quarter. You also mentioned that you\u2019ve seen less pressure on the labor side. So do you expect to continue seeing maybe some relief on labor cost as volumes recover and contractors come back to the market or is that a temporary development?","Jon Jaffe","This is Jon. I think that we\u2019re seeing as the recovery matures, the labor force is getting more and more comfortable with hiring and acquiring equipment. So the labor force we feel is catching up. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s caught up yet but we\u2019re not seeing as much pressure as we saw before and that\u2019s why we described that\u2019s been easing.","We will still overall costs go up. As Stuart mentioned, certain material categories are going up. Lumber has gone up slightly in the fourth quarter and first quarter. We\u2019d expect lumber to go up a little bit more in the second quarter.","So I think you\u2019ll see a moderation of the year-over-year cost increase but think it\u2019d probably be sequentially based on what\u2019s already in our system, 3% to 4% higher in our Q2 deliveries over Q1. I mean, that\u2019s slowly coming down sequentially and year-over-year.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thanks. And then getting back to the topic of pursuing land deals with maybe slightly lower gross margins but minimal SG&A outlays. Are these projects you\u2019ve already started to pursue or is that something you would start to do once the market reaches higher volumes?","Rick Beckwitt","This is Rick. This is something that we\u2019ve already started pursuing and that I think are starting against now.","Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Go ahead, your line is open.","Jade Rahmani - KBW","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you provide any color on how land prices have moved over the last quarter and year-to-date. I noticed you picked up your pace of acquisition and I want to see if you could comment on that.","Rick Beckwitt","So on the land acquisition side, keep in mind that a fair amount is what we have purchased during the quarter was put under contract several quarters ago and maybe even years ago. So it\u2019s just the timing as it moves through the snake.","From a pricing standpoint, prices have moved up a bit, in some markets they have been flat. It really depends on the flow of activity in the individual markets. We\u2019re pretty comfortable with where the market is right now. And as we\u2019ve said in prior calls, we benefit from the fact that we\u2019re not primarily looking for immediate delivery type of things. Jon, any flavor from your side?","Jon Jaffe","Yeah, it\u2019s very market specific. So if you look at Phoenix, it definitely has flattened in that kind of market. But in Coastal California, it continues to be very heated and increases. But as Rick said, we are really well positioned with what we need for next couple of years. So, we tend to be looking at either the short-term, quicker turns or more of an entitlement play where we can patrol land for the future and still have healthy margins.","Jade Rahmani - KBW","Great. I appreciate the color. Just on the Financial Services side, I think you noted in the opening remarks about the retail strategy. You mentioned that could supplement volumes. Can you discuss that in further detail and what that actually entails?","Stuart Miller","Sure, Jade. Right now in total, we have over 90% of our origination or purchase originations. But we have a retail platform called Eagle Mortgage and it was heavily focused geographically on the West part of the country. We are looking to open branches and expand that from the West Coast of the country across to the East Coast and expand that platform. So focusing primarily on purchase business, but leveraging our back office and our systems to get more operating leverage on that platform. So this will be a slow methodical growth program over the next several years.","Jade Rahmani - KBW","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Stuart Miller","Okay. And why don\u2019t we take one last question.","Operator","Our last question is from David Goldberg with UBS. Goldberg, go ahead. Your line is open.","David Goldberg - UBS","Yes. Thanks for taking my call. Very good afternoon.","Stuart Miller","Hi, David.","David Goldberg - UBS","My first question was on -- actually, I wanted to ask a follow-up to a question Eli had asked earlier and Stuart mentioned. It seem some loosening starting to come through that\u2019s really the first we\u2019ve kind of been hearing from builders with some of the bank efforts to loosen, are starting to show up in actual builder result. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on, what is it, is it procedural loosening, is it credit loosening, is it loosening in terms of standards? Can you just give us some increased color on what you meant by the comments and where you have seen it?","Stuart Miller","Actually, I think we\u2019ve been hearing it from most of the builders over the past quarters and the loosening has been a gradual, very gradual acceptance by the banks that the standards articulated by the GSEs and FHA, VA, are not going to give rise to put backs. And where they feel comfortable that there are not going to put backs, they have been loosening up some of the overlays that have been in place for some period of time.","Some of this is derived from the just the practical application of the evaporation of the refi market. As the refi business has dissipated, the banks have started to expand their desire to lend this to more primary purchasers as they try to fill the void, that\u2019s been left behind by the refi market. And we\u2019ve seen that over the past year. Bruce, maybe you would like to weigh in on?","Bruce Gross","Sure. And additionally things like the mortgage insurance market coming back, we now have close to 40% of our conventional loan that\u2019s getting mortgage insurance. So they\u2019re putting down 20% of the tune of that 40%. So all of these things are small steps, but we are seeing it directionally heading in the right direction.","I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to necessarily see a fixed spike up, but all these things are helping on the margins. We have seen some of the overlays, as Stuart said, have eliminated. We are seeing some of the people coming out of the short sale and foreclosure time expiration period. So the trend is positive with a lot of small steps.","Stuart Miller","And I think we\u2019ve also heard some of the banks articulate that they\u2019re going to rethink the subprime market and start looking at the other avenues through opening up lending channels.","Bruce Gross","Right. They\u2019re going to look to replace that revenue. They lost the refinance volume like everybody else and they were looking to replace that. And they\u2019re eliminating the overlays that were put in place both with FICO scores coming down as well as some of the conditions to be able to get loans.","David Goldberg - UBS","That color is really helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up, with the move-in to the retail, some more retail operations on the mortgage, on the finance side, can you talk about the regulatory scrutiny you are facing? We have heard from a lot of lenders that they\u2019ve been facing increased regulatory scrutiny including from the CFPB. Can you talk about costs in the business and if you think being in the retail side increasingly would open you up to more scrutiny as a mortgage originator? Thanks so much.","Stuart Miller","Sure. As you know, on the regulatory side, the increased costs, we had already put those in place over the last year or so with respect to more quality control. So that\u2019s been embedded in our program. We haven\u2019t seen additional scrutiny. We follow the right procedures. I think some of the scrutiny you might be referring to has also been on the servicing side with some companies that have bought large servicing portfolios.","But our program is a methodical program following the same procedures we do on the purchase side. So, we\u2019re not expecting to be in a position that there\u2019s going to be scrutiny on the retail side. We have a great group of associates with Eagle Mortgage. We are looking to leverage which worked well for many years for us. So, we\u2019re not expecting any issues there.","David Goldberg - UBS","Thanks so much. I appreciate the color.","Stuart Miller","Very good. Well, that wraps it up for today. Very happy to report our results for the first quarter and look forward to circling back and reporting on our progress throughout the year. Thank you for joining us and we will speak soon. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I will now turn the call over to Alexandra Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statements.","Alexandra Lumpkin","Thank you and good morning.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Operator","I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. You may begin.","Stuart Miller","Good morning. Thank you and good morning everybody. This morning I'm here with Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer; Jon Jaffe, our President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, our Controller; of course you just heard from Alex; and a number of others.","I'm going to go ahead and start as we always do with a brief overview. Rick and Jon will give an operational update and then Diane will give further detail on our second quarter numbers as well as some additional guidance for the rest of the year. As always when we get to Q&A, I'd like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and a follow-up so that we can accommodate as many as we can . ","So, let me go ahead and begin by saying that we're very pleased to report a very solid second quarter performance, reflecting both a pickup of the homes that were lost in the first quarter due to weather conditions and a general recovery in the housing market.","Deliveries improved 5% over last year while new orders improved to last year's levels and exceeded the upper end of our guidance by just a little over 2%. In the second quarter, we achieved net earnings of over $421 million or $1.30 per share and our strong cash position enabled us to opportunistically repurchase another 1 million shares of stock and set up the repayments of $500 million of debt just after the quarter ended.","At quarter's end and before the debt repayment, we recorded a debt to total capital ratio of 38.3%, which is a 410 basis points improvement over last year's level. Overall, our results reflect the fact that the housing markets strengthened throughout the second quarter confirming and continuing the trend that we reported on our earnings call last quarter.","We clearly saw traffic and sales continue to strengthen in the second quarter as the combination of lower interest rates together with at least slower price appreciation and in some instances slightly lower prices have positively impacted affordability. And that together with low unemployment, wage growth, consumer confidence, and economic growth drove the consumer to return to a more affordable housing market.","And while the current market conditions would not be considered robust, they would be considered solid. We believe that the housing market is generally running in a performance channel that is bounded on the downside by the production deficit that has persisted for the past decade and has kept housing supply constrained, while it is somewhat moderated on the upside by rising land and labor costs as well as affordability limits. Within this channel the market is generally continuing to improve, and we believe, will continue to improve for the foreseeable future.","Although we reported gross margins at the lower end of our previous guidance, this reflects the greater than expected incentives used during the market slowdown or pause to maintain volume ensure -- and ensure that we achieve our 2019 closing targets between 50,000 and 51,000 homes and we remain confident that we will achieve this target this year.","We expect to see our margins improve steadily throughout the remainder of the year as prices remain stable and incentives continue to subside. Accordingly, we expect to generate strong cash flow for the remainder of 2019 and expect to continue to use excess cash flow to both pay down debt, while opportunistically repurchasing stock.","We're well-positioned to thrive in this solid market condition. We've continued to refine our ramp strategies to position ourselves for strong performance and a strengthening balance sheet. Rick's going to update further -- this further in his remarks.","And additionally we have noted -- as we've noted in prior calls, we continued to invest capital in technology initiatives that are redefining the future of both our company and our industry. We believe that our tech initiatives represent significant opportunity and upside for the company as we create efficiencies in internal operations, reduce our SG&A, and reduce our cost structure.","In the second quarter, our SG&A continued its downward trend with our lowest second quarter level ever at 8.4%. We continue to be laser-focused on progress on our technology adoptions and change management, and this is being incrementally reflected in bottom line improvements, while we enhance our customer experience and our customer interface. We're still at the very beginnings of opportunities that we envisioned as we're going to build an ever better and more efficient mousetrap.","Before I turn over to Rick, Jon, and Diane, let me just say that we remain encouraged by both Lennar's position and market conditions for the remainder of the year. Our size and scale in each of our strategic markets continues to manage -- to help us manage cost and production in a land and labor constrained market. Our focus on technology is driving efficiency that is reflected in our consistent improvement in SG&A.","Our strong cash flow and bottom line profitability are continuing to enable us to reduce debt and repurchase shares. Our strong balance sheet continues to improve and position us for the future. And our strategy of shedding non-core assets continues to drive an intensified focus on our core homebuilding business.","As the homebuilding market continues to solidify in the wake of the recent pause, we're optimistic about our ability to deliver strong and consistent performance for the remainder of 2019.","And with that, let me turn over to the rest of the team. Rick?","Rick Beckwitt","Thanks Stuart. In these recovering market conditions, our homebuilding operations executed at a high level and produced solid results. Homebuilding revenues for the second quarter totaled $5.2 billion, representing a 3% increase from 2018. This was driven by a 5% increase in deliveries to 12,729 homes and a 1% decrease in average sales price.","Deliveries for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance as we were able to accelerate some third quarter closings into the second quarter. Our gross margin for the quarter totaled 20.1%, which was within the range of prior guidance and flat sequentially with our first quarter.","As Stuart mentioned, our second quarter gross margin was impacted by an increase in sales incentives offered to homebuyers during the market pause in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our margin was also slightly impacted by an increase in the number of closings coming from third-party option contracts versus on land that we developed ourselves. This is in line with our land-lighter strategy that is focused on maximizing cash flow and our internal rates of return.","Notwithstanding that our gross margins were down in the quarter, we expect our margins to increase in both Q3 and Q4 through a combination of reduced incentives and lower direct construction costs that Jon will talk about.","Our SG&A in the quarter was 8.4%. This marks an all-time second quarter low and highlights the power of our increased local market scale and our operating leverage. Homebuilding operating earnings on the sale of homes totaled $603 million, up 48% from the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter totaled $421.5 million, up 36% from 2018.","New orders for the quarter increased 1% to 14,518 homes, exceeding the high-end of our Q1 guidance. From a dollar value perspective, new orders totaled $5.8 billion, which was down 4% from the prior year, reflecting an increase in sales incentives, which I talk about a higher percentage of entry-level homes and a transition away from the higher-priced CalAtlantic homes in the year ago period.","Our average sales price will continue to move lower going forward as many new entry-level communities come online. This is particularly the case in Texas, as all of our Texas markets in the last 18 months we bought over 75% of the land that's targeted to entry-level product.","During the second quarter, we saw increased seasonal demand, which benefited from both lower mortgage rates and moderating sales price increases. Homebuyers' sentiment improved throughout the quarter and we experienced solid traffic on both our website and our Welcome Home Centers. While our rates helped drive demand, we continued to price to market and offer incentives although at reduced levels from the market pause to keep our homebuilding business on track to build and close more than 50,000 homes in 2019.","We continue to believe that maintaining an even flow of steady production is the best operating strategy, as it will drive higher operating margins, IRRs and increase shareholder value. We ended the second quarter with a sales backlog of 19,061 homes with a total dollar value of $7.7 billion. This backlog combined with our current housing inventory puts us in a great position to achieve strong operating results in fiscal 2019.","Before I turn it over to Jon, let me give you a brief update on our land initiatives. The three strategic initiatives we discussed last quarter have continued to expand in both their initial markets and into new markets. In the last quarter, these ventures have put under contract or closed more than 11,000 homesites.","Lennar will build on the majority of these homesites with selective sales to other builders to enhance the overall return in these ventures. As I said in the past, the majority of these homesites will be delivered to us fully developed on a rolling basis so just-in-time inventory.","In the second quarter, we also announced another strategic transaction with Level Homes an Engquist Development in Raleigh, North Carolina. Through this transaction, we purchased 34 homes under construction and 29 developed homesites. More importantly, in continuing with our asset-light land strategy, we have a future right to purchase approximately 1,600 finished homesites across seven communities. These homesites will be delivered by Engquist over the next six years and this marks the beginning of a new strategic relationship in the Carolinas.","Recognizing the continuing short supply of dwellings both for sale and for rent, we recently entered an agreement with one of our long-standing third-party relationships to build homes that will be purchased by that third-party in a stand-alone rental community. This community is in Florida and is the first in what we believe will be an ongoing business strategy and relationship where we build and sell homes in bulk on land owned by third parties with no lease-up risk.","We are actively discussing this program with several landowners and investors that control large parcels of land suitable for single-family rentals in locations where we have a leading market share and we are the low-cost producer. We are optimistic that we can replicate this program, and that we can leverage our buying power and building expertise to achieve outside returns, and continue to lower our SG&A. We love this new business model as it will generate high IRRs, strong margins; leverage our existing overhead with no accompanying land risk. This is a perfect expansion of our land-light strategy.","Now I'll turn it over to Jon.","Jon Jaffe","Thanks Rick. Today I'm going to give some color on the various cost factors that impact our cost of sales and the timing of how they flow through our deliveries. First, with respect to direct construction costs, there are several components impacting our direct costs. The positives are tailwinds that come from the drop in lumber prices, cost synergies and our production-first operating platform. The headwinds are cost pressures from the ongoing labor shortage in tariffs.","While there are many variables that affect our direct cost, including the mix of homes closing in any particular quarter, as we look back at Q2 and look forward at the next few quarters we see that directionally our direct construction costs are decreasing. In the second quarter, the cost of materials, which account for 57% of our directs will lower sequentially by 0.5%. This is the first time in years that the cost of materials has dropped as lower-cost lumber and synergies flow through our closings.","The biggest factor impacting material cost is lumber, which represents approximately 13% of direct cost. The peak pricing for lumber was back in June of 2018 at approximately $600 per thousand board feet. That pricing went into place for homes we started in July through September of 2018 and those homes deliver primarily in Q1 and Q2 of 2019.","Lumber dropped to around $330 per thousand board feet in December of 2018. It then bounced back to $400 before trending to its low point earlier this month in June of $300 per thousand board feet. The December pricing will impact homes that started in January through March for Lennar, which will primarily be delivering in our third and fourth quarters. Deliveries in our second quarter will mostly start in October through December and priced off of September's lumber pricing of around $400 per thousand board feet.","With respect to synergies, we remain on track to achieve our targets and are seeing those savings reflected in our cost of deliveries. Let me walk you through the timing of these synergies.","Synergies were first layered in as negotiations with national vendors took place shortly after the merger in Q2 and Q3 of 2018. This was followed by negotiations with local trade partners, which resulted in new trade contracts for home starts in Q3 and Q4 through 2018.","The transition of closing out CalAtlantic communities and the conversion of product to Lennar's more efficient Everything's Included platform takes place over a longer period of time. Once a new contract is established based on the negotiations for trades and new specifications and plan changes then new permits were required for the start of the new product to benefit from these lower cost.","Homes benefiting from these production change strategy benefits have saving starting in our second quarter -- with homes delivering in our second quarter and a meaningful cohort of these plans we'll deliver in the second half of 2019.","The severity of the labor shortage in the construction industry is the strongest headwind that we face. Labor cost represent 43% of our direct spend and were up 2.8% sequentially in the second quarter and 7.7% year-over-year. While labor cost continues to rise, I strongly believe our Builder of Choice focus has allowed Lennar to minimize the impact of labor -- of the labor shortage, especially in our ability to access labor for our jobsites.","Another headwind is tariffs on material cost. Firstly, with the 10% tariff on Chinese goods that took place last September, and then another 15% this June. On average the impact to us is about $500 per home. We're in constant communication with our manufacturing partners, discussing strategies for offsetting impacts to these tariffs with alternate specifications and locations in manufacturing. The strategic relationships with our manufacturers just like with the rest of our trade partners is a result of the focus of our Builder of Choice program. We're seeing the benefits of this play out in real-time with discussions that develop solutions for avoiding cost increases, while improving safety, quality and cycle times despite the labor shortages.","We consistently give advanced visibility to our trades for our production needs allowing them to plan accordingly. Maintaining an even flow start pace with our Everything's Included platform allows the trades to make better utilization of their limited labor. These efforts combined with our significant size and scale in each market enables Lennar to be the low-cost builder to serve.","Lastly, another headwind affecting our cost of sales is land. Land cost as a percent of sales is increasing primarily due to two factors. As we've noted on previous calls, the land market remains constrained as entitlements are taking longer, restricting the availability of land in the market, which results in appreciating land cost. Additionally, as Rick mentioned, we're delivering a higher percentage of homes on option or just-in-time land. While this land delivers higher returns it comes at a cost premium, due to the low risk and short carry time associated with it.","Overall, we remain focused on improving our net operating margin, free cash flow and return on capital. We're driven to simplify our operations enabling us to execute on our four pillars, our Builder of Choice production first operational program, our just-in-time selling platform driven by our dynamic pricing model, our technology-driven efficiency leverage overhead structure, and last our simple and efficient Everything's Included platform.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Diane, who will give you more color on how these costs will result in our margin guidance for Q3 and Q4.","Diane Bessette","So thank you Jon, and good morning to everyone. So let me summarize and reemphasize a few points from our second quarter starting with homebuilding. So as we've mentioned looking at deliveries, deliveries increased 5% from the prior year and exceeded the upper range of March guidance by 6% as we benefited from both deliveries that were postponed by weather from our first quarter, and the recovering housing market.","Our second quarter gross margin on home sales was 20.1%. The prior year's gross margin was 21.6% excluding CalAtlantic's purchase accounting. Q2 2019 gross margins were impacted by an increase in sales incentives offered during the homebuilding market pause and an increase in construction cost as a result of continued cost pressures due to land and labor shortages.","Our second quarter SG&A was 8.4%, which is the lowest second quarter SG&A percent we have ever achieved. This compares to 8.7% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to continued operating leverage, evidenced through improvements in personnel and related expenses, and a decrease in broker commission's year-over-year.","And then turning to new orders, new orders increased 1% from the prior year and additionally new orders exceeded the upper range of March guidance by 2%. Looking at absorptions, absorptions for the second quarter was 3.7 versus 3.6 in the prior year. Additionally, we ended the quarter with 1,325 active communities.","And finally for homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we had a combined loss of $21 million compared to $17 million of earnings in the prior year. This was primarily due to a loss on consolidation of a previously unconsolidated entity, partially offset by our share of operating earnings from one of our unconsolidated entity.","Then turning to Financial Services, looking at the results, the operating earnings net of non-controlling interest related to States Title were $62 million compared to $56 million in the prior year. And here is the detail of the components.","Mortgage operating earnings increased to $43 million compared to \u2013 from $35 million in the prior year. As a result of the sale of our retail mortgage business in Q1 of 2019, total origination volumes decreased to $2.6 billion from $2.9 billion. The sale of the retail business however enabled the mortgage division to focus solely on the captive business, implement technology improvements, streamline processes and achieve G&A reductions that exceeded the impact from lower origination volumes.","Title operating earnings were $13 million compared to $16 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to the sale of the majority of our retail agency business and title insurance underwriter business to States Title in Q1 2019, which resulted in a decrease in retail closed orders. This decrease in retail volume was partially offset by an increase in captive closed orders and a decrease in G&A expenses, due to the sale.","Rialto Mortgage Finance operating earnings were $6 million compared to $3 million in the prior year. The increase was due to higher securitization dollar volume during the quarter as compared to the prior year.","And then turning to Multifamily, our Multifamily segment had an operating loss of $4 million compared to operating earnings of $15 million in the prior year. There were no sales in the quarter compared to two sales in the prior year that resulted in $17 million in gain for that segment. However, we had $4 million of promote revenue compared to \u2013 related to communities as Lennar Multifamily Venture Fund I compared to $5 million in the prior year.","A few weeks ago, we announced the final closing of Lennar Multifamily Venture Fund II with the total of $1.3 billion of equity commitments including Lennar's commitment of $381 million. This success is a continuation of the build-to-hold platform that we have migrated to where we earn feed and promote, while creating value within our fund.","And then finally, in the other category, as a reminder this category is for the legacy Rialto assets outside of Rialto Mortgage Finance and our strategic technology investments. Earnings were $2 million in the second quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year.","Now turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $801 million of cash. At the end of the quarter, our homesites owned and controlled were 289,000 of which 215,000 are owned and 74,000 were controlled. Land acquisition spend during the quarter was $755 million and land development spend was $611 million. We had borrowings on our revolving credit facility of $550 million, leaving $1.85 billion of available capacity. At quarter end, our homebuilding debt to total cap was 38.3% and during the quarter we repurchased 1 million shares for a total of approximately $52 million.","Stockholders equity increased to $15.2 billion and our book value per share grew to $47.06 per share. And then subsequent to quarter end as Stuart mentioned, we retired $500 million of senior notes that were due in June.","So then turning to guidance, I'd like to just give some guidance for the third quarter. Starting with homebuilding, we expect new orders between 12,500 and 12,800. We expect to deliver between 13,000 and 13,250 homes, which reflects the acceleration of home deliveries into Q2. We expect our Q3 average sales price to be between $385,000 and $390,000. We expect our Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 20.25% to 20.5% and our SG&A to be in the range of 8.3% to 8.4%. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories we expect a Q3 loss of approximately $10 million to $15 million.","And turning to our ancillary businesses, we believe our Financial Services earnings will be between $52 million and $55 million. We believe our Multifamily earnings will be about $5 million. And for the other category related to the Rialto legacy assets and our strategic investments, we expect Q3 earnings of approximately $3 million.","We expect our corporate G&A to be about 1.7% of total revenue. And we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25.5% for the remainder of the year. The weighted average share count for Q3 should be approximately 321 million shares. And when you roll up all of those numbers, the guidance that we are expecting is an EPS range of $1.25 to $1.35.","And now let me update guidance for the full fiscal year 2019. With regard to deliveries, we expect to deliver between 50,500 and 51,000 homes. We believe our average sales price will be about $400,000. Our gross margin is still expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Our SG&A should be in the range of 8.3% to 8.4% as we continue to benefit from operating leverage.","Financial Services earnings should be in the range of $200 million to $205 million. Our Multifamily earnings should be in the range of $8 million to $10 million, and we expect corporate G&A to be in the range of 1.5% to 1.6% of total revenues. So in summary, we believe we are well positioned to have strong profitability and cash flow generation in 2019.","And now, let me turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per person. Our first question is coming from the line of Mike Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Mike Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. First question, just on the housing market and some of the commentary that you gave earlier on in your prepared remarks, specifically talking about the housing market strengthening during the second quarter. You highlighted traffic and sales.","And, I believe, even, if I heard you right, incentives declining, but I just wanted to get a little bit more granular in terms of the order trends, if possible. How they progressed during the quarter? Obviously, they came in a little bit above your guidance. And any commentary around June as well particularly as it relates to any possible early impact from the recent further decline in rates.","Stuart Miller","Yes. So, Mike, I think that, what we highlighted in the call is that the market had really continued the trend that we saw in the first quarter. There had been progressive improvements through the quarter, though fairly mild. And I was clear to say that, the market rather than being robust could be qualified as solid and it really did solidify through the quarter. And I think that's what you're seeing play through our numbers. Rick, you want to add to that?","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. And if I had to give you sort of trajectory in the quarter, May was the strongest month for us from both the new sales orders, from an absorption pace standpoint, and from just an overall field traffic and buyer sentiment. Incentives were down quite a bit from our fourth quarter with regard to the incentive in the sales order. And that's what gives us a little bit confidence that you'll start to see some margin improvement in the back half of the year combined with the construction cost up that Jon highlighted.","Mike Rehaut","That's great. Thank you Stuart and Rick on that. I guess, secondly, just to highlight your -- or talk a little bit more about the incentive trends. Specifically, the gross margins, you kind of highlighted that the increase -- if I heard it right, that the sequential increase in incentives on closings was still more of a flow-through from the softness in the fourth quarter. I wanted to be sure that that was fully the case.","And that, as you're saying, maybe we could just shift the attention a little more towards, if you have any stats, around incentives on orders. And you've kind of been saying that they're down materially from the fourth quarter. I was curious on the cadence -- the continued cadence if there was any improvement in incentives on 2Q orders versus 1Q? So, I think, that's an area of focus right now as it relates to -- if the market continues to strengthen, as you talk about -- if the pricing has further improved 2Q versus 1Q?","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. That's what I was trying to address. If you looked at the incentives in the new sales orders, not in the closed home, for Q4, that was about 6.1% in the fourth quarter. As we moved into Q1 and Q2, we saw additional improvement, Q1 was about 5.7%, Q2 was about 5.6%, but trending in the quarter down through the quarter of Q2.","Mike Rehaut","Okay. So the 5.7% and 5.6% were -- you're talking specifically on orders?","Rick Beckwitt","That's what you asked, yes.","Mike Rehaut","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Truman Patterson","Hi. Good morning, everybody. This is actually Truman Patterson on for Stephen. Thanks for taking our questions. Just piggybacking off that last commentary with you guys saying that May was the strongest month of the year from, I believe, orders and absorptions and incentives. Do you guys believe that the lower interest rate environment has extended the spring selling season?","Stuart Miller","Well, I think, that's yet to be seen. We generally don't comment beyond the end of the quarter, but we definitely saw the market being fairly solid through the second quarter. And even as we've started to go into the third, it feels like the market is, as I said, solid.","Lower interest rates clearly are impacting affordability. That's bringing people back to the market. And while new home sales are reported across the nation right now at down by about 7% or 8%, we're still looking at a generally solid economic environment with low unemployment and increasing wages basically getting customers to act on their appetite to find a home.","We're in short supply relative to homes and interest rates is really enabling affordability to kick in and to bring buyers back to the market. So that's a trend that we've been seeing and that's kind of how we see things as we look through the end of the year, continuing to improve and solidify.","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. And as I said in my remarks, the market is really following its typical seasonal pattern with improvement from the prior quarter periods. So I think it's too soon to tell whether it's going to be an elongated selling season because of mortgage rates being down. But what it has done is peak buyer interest, because things are more affordable right now.","Jonathan Jaffe","And this is Jon. I'll just add to that, if you think about it the second quarter of 2018, everyone thought that was a very strong market for new home sales and we surpassed that level in our second quarter of 2019. So again, direction talks about an improving marketplace. And there's no question as Stuart mentioned that the affordability impacted the lower interest rates is helping that.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thanks for that. I didn't hear a community count number. Could you guys just give us an update on community count growth? And last quarter you guys mentioned some weather-related catch up. I'm really just trying to get a sense of where you all think you could end the year and looking forward to some longer-term growth potential?","Diane Bessette","Yes. Steve. So we ended the quarter with 1,325 active communities. And if you look at where we think we'll be for Q3, we think it'll probably be flattish with the prior year. And if you look ahead as you get to the end of the year, we might be a little bit lower than the prior year just because we're accelerating our absorption pace.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thank you guys. And then anything kind of longer term, how you guys are thinking about community count growth?","Richard Beckwitt","Well we haven't really given projections into 2020, so I think that's a little bit premature right now.","Truman Patterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ivy Zelman of Ivy & Associates. Your line is open.","Richard Beckwitt","Good morning.","Ivy Zelman","Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. So I'm going to go for the bigger picture question given the fact that your stock is selling off and I think there's a big elephant in the room that no one's addressing, which is the fear of recession and the yield curve is certainly telling us that. So people say to me, why in the world would I want to own a homebuilding stock late in the cycle with the risk of recession around the corner after 10 years of economic recovery.","And I think something you guys said today, sorry for the background noise was really interesting about your ability to sell homes to single-family rental operators. And one of the big concerns I hear about Lennar's specifically is that your factory of 50,000-plus units a year being the number three or higher in 25 markets, you actually have to continue to take a lot of risk in terms of exposure to land. And recognizing that if there is a downturn, you actually have more exposure than anybody else, because you have such a big machine to feed.","So talk to us about in the downturn, if in fact a recession were to come to fruition, which I personally don't think is going to happen, but I'm not an economist and predicting recessions. But if in fact, how much of it for example of the single-family rental piece, whether it's Opendoor that's buying your homes or is -- or some of these guys that then sell it to a single-family rental operator. I think people are just very concerned about the risk of being involved in homebuilding sites this late in the cycle. And all of your size, even if you guys are doing an awesome job on scale, it's still a very capital-intensive business with obviously cyclicality risks. Thank you.","Stuart Miller","Well there are a lot of embedded questions there Ivy and a lot of topic. And I think that we can all agree that there are crosscurrents in today's market. And there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic into -- this world quite positively. And there are some concerns that are out there, some of them are at the macro level and those are environmental programs that we're going to have to fit into. At the end of the day, our view is that the base of the economy is strong, unemployment's low. And relative to the housing market, you're really dealing in a world that we've not seen before.","And that is for the past 10 years, you've really seen relative to the population of the country, a production deficit that has persisted. And that persistence means that housing is in short supply, is going to continue in short supply and there are going to be some movements in the market overall that are sometimes up, sometimes down. Affordability will be tested as we saw with the pause. But even with land short labor constrained prices or costs being pushed up, there's a need that is driving the housing market. And in our view and I've said this for some time, it presents somewhat of a floor for a downward limit on how constrained the market can get.","And while the upside in the market is somewhat constrained as well, because of cost and affordability, there is a channel of production that it seems in order to fill the need for dwellings in the country, we're going to be traversing for quite some time. And if you look at a normalized level of production, and I know some people question it of around 1.5 million and maybe it's a little bit lower, we've been underperforming that for some time.","Now what we've done is we've created some innovative land strategies and some innovative production strategies, recognizing that there will be a balance between what is sold and what is rented. And we're participating in both sides of that market in our rental program in our for-sale housing program that will in some instances be sold to groups that are buying and leasing. And we're really adopting a broad strategy of participating in all parts of the market as the country overall has to fill the need of dwellings that are in short supply.","Richard Beckwitt","I guess the other...","Diane Bessette","Well I think that's a -- go ahead Rick. Sorry.","Richard Beckwitt","I'd add -- Ivy is we benefit from being the low-cost producer. And while margins may move up or down depending on what goes on in the economy, we do know that we have an operating advantage. In addition to that, on this for-sale rental stuff, these are in areas that we wouldn't build, but for this type of program, because it's not a good for-sale market, it's more affordable markets where we found an opportunity to leverage our operating platform.","As Stuart said, we are not seeing cracks in the system out there. We feel that the economy is moving along. And we're quite confident that if there is a downturn that we'll be able to react very proactively and slowdown the machine, but still have tremendous cash flow, because we won't have to buy as much land.","So I think in an environment where the market goes down, we're really strategically positioned to outperform. Got to keep in mind that during the last downturn there were different issues at play. The biggest issue was that people couldn't afford to stay in their homes, because mortgage rates were much higher. We don't have that. And then past decline that's when a lot of inventory came to the market because people couldn't afford to live where they were living. That's not the case today.","Ivy Zelman","Well I think that's really helpful both of you. I think I'm just trying to be -- play devil's advocate, because I think your stock's the best recommendation that we have in our sector, it's our top pick.","And what I see is just this hesitancy and concern. So what you just said Rick is that even if there was a downturn, the cash flow that you would generate do you -- I'm assuming you guys have modeled out what a recession not led by housing but let's just say trade wars or something that creates a recession what your sort of different sensitivities are. And I think it'd be helpful maybe not on this call, but I just think that's what the market's talking about today reminds me of when China was blowing up in first quarter 2016 and there's just a lot of fear and uncertainty. And you guys as a homebuilding company till you lived through a downturn maybe people stay away. And I think they're not doing themselves a service buying the stock here, but it'll be helpful for you guys to help even though you don't think Stuart there's going to be a recession, what happens to the company's earnings? What does it look like? What does the cash flow look like? I think that all will be really constructive for us to understand better.","Stuart Miller","Okay. Look we can add some color to that. But I think that we start with the understanding that our strategy is basically derived from that view of this channel and the downside protected and upside, kind of, limited moving through this middle zone.","And remember as we said, as we went through the pause in the second half of 2018 we're focused on building through using pricing to basically maintain production, which maintains cash flow. And so as you think about the way that we would model a recession that is not housing led, and I think that it would not be but might be a derivative of trade wars or other things. It would be defined by those thoughts that the production deficit is a buffer, land and labor is a limiting factor and we're going to continue to produce homes at an accelerated level by using pricing to keep our production machine moving through.","Ivy Zelman","Great. Well, good luck guys. Thank you.","Stuart Miller","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much guys. Stuart, Rick, Jon if I can maybe follow-up here on that line of thinking. I think there's really no dispute about the -- some of the factors, which you've said can act as buffers to the industry as we go into the next downturn whenever that is.","But by the same token, it's a little surprising to me that you would need -- that you wouldn't be seeing those same factors and then put together with lower rates, driving better pricing in the marketplace today without the need -- in other words it's surprising to me that you need to continue to have incentives.","At the level that you're doing, I would have thought that your incentives would have been able to drop substantially sequentially from 1Q to 2Q in light of the lower rates and you've talked about the housing market having -- or your demand experiencing a typical seasonal pattern I think was your phrase.","But rates have not been following a normal seasonal pattern this year. And so if I pull in my question with incentives, because you've been kind enough to give us this metric of 6.1%, 5.7%, 5.6%. Is that in your view keeping up with the market or are you leading the market with incentives? And if you could talk a little bit about why you think the incentive level that you're at has been necessary in light of the fact that the rates have dropped so much?","Jon Jaffe","Hey, Steve its Jon. I definitely characterize that as keeping up with the market. We are not of a scale nor is any other builder to make the market, and so you have a consumer that is looking at what value can they get for their monthly payment, which interest rates will have a big effect on, and creates a market pricing.","We're participating in that market from community, community it may vary, might be more or less aggressive depending on that particular marketplace. But in general we're in the market and I think it's just a reflection of a long upcycle, but one that's defined as slow and steady, which in a lot of respects is more healthy than one that is very robust because that can't last very long. And so when this channel that Stuart described in my view is slow and steady, so there isn't robust demand that as you think about your question of normal seasonality why hasn't it been stronger and created a greater reduction incentive. It's really a reflection of marketplace that we've seen for the last few years just continuing forward at that pace.","Stuart Miller","Additionally, I would say that if the perception is that we\u2019re using incentives to stimulate the market in a broader sense, the incentive structure is -- advice that at a very local level community-by-community in response to existing market condition. This in cooperation with Jon, Rick our division presidents and the people on the ground. So you're really looking at a composite incentive number that derives from what the local level is telling us that the market is requesting. So it's an active feedback rather than something that is forced downward to drive the market.","Jon Jaffe","Steve, let's also remember the incentives number would go to zero even in the best of markets where we are closing cost and cost of that nature. So the floor is sort of call it 3%-ish in terms of what the bottom in a really strong market would be.","Rick Beckwitt","I think, sort of, just to end this. We run the analytics and models to understand where we maximize returns and profitability based on pricing and pace. And we started this year saying that we were going to deliver a certain number, we knew what our fixed overhead and our operating cost were and we're driving towards a cash flow number and an earnings number.","And we could certainly slow down production and push price, but that wouldn't produce a better result. So I think we're operating the company with the strategy that we entered the year and we are focused on one small piece of the puzzle and there's a big -- a lot of pieces around it.","Stephen Kim","Yeah, that's helpful and that is just one of the things that we look at where we look at, obviously, a lot and we try to look at as many things as you look at to the best of our ability.","So in that vein going to land spend, I was a little surprised that your acquisition oriented land spend wasn't lower this quarter given a market environment that is solid but not robust and given an outlook for -- given the order situation being flattish year-on-year and community count going to be flat to may be even slightly down by the end of the year.","I was a little surprised that your acquisition spend was I think it was about first half of this year it's about $1.5 billion, and I think in the back half of last year it was like $1.6 billion or so. I would have thought that the acquisition land spent would be declining as we go forward. So can you give us a sense for what we can expect from the acquisition oriented land spend, which obviously would tie into your cash flow outlook over the next couple of quarters?","Rick Beckwitt","Yes. I'll let Diane talk about the go-forward number. But I think, you need to keep in mind Steve that the land spend in any quarter is not necessarily dollars that are at -- that just came together in an acquisition in that quarter. Some deals take years to come together in order to get to a point where all the entitlements are in place and we're ready to go. And a lot of the land that you're looking at that got acquired has been under contract for two or three years. So you can't look at a comparison between last quarter and the quarter before that to this because it's apples and oranges particularly since we're buying and contracting for a much larger business now than we were in the past.","Diane Bessette","Yes Steven, I think if you just look at the numbers, our second quarter was not too dissimilar from the first quarter, a little bit higher, but not materially and so I think we're clearly are in the second quarter is a good proxy for what you'll see in the third and fourth quarters as well.","Stephen Kim","Okay, great. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley of Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew Bouley","Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the guidance. You're guiding to I guess implying growing deliveries by double digits in the fourth quarter, but you're saying that -- or guiding to order growth of kind of low single digits in the third quarter. Obviously, the backlog is down a bit year-over-year in units. So, is there any additional color there perhaps around your internal star projections? What else could you say that gives kind of insight into reaching that fourth quarter delivery guidance in light of where orders and backlog are? Thank you.","Diane Bessette","Yes, I think if you look at our third quarter of guidance on delivery, you're absolutely right. We're sort of in the single-digit range and we see pickup as you go into the fourth quarter. We're generally back-end loaded. So I'm not sure that we're too dissimilar. If you look at the pattern of last year, pretty similar, we always pick up and have our strongest --new order and delivery growth in the fourth quarter. So I'm not sure that we're too out of sync with the typical pattern.","Matthew Bouley","Okay. Understood. And then secondly, the SG&A side, I think you've shown some pretty clear progress with the tech investments and streamlining all the costs. I think Stuart you termed it as a significant opportunity still going forward. So just any additional thoughts on kind of the longer term opportunity, broker commissions, advertising, what are the different buckets and how much runway is their on all that? Thank you.","Stuart Miller","Yes. Look I've noted this before. I think that there is still a lot of opportunity throughout our SG&A levels to improve our business operation by using technologies and we're working with a number of really vibrant programs and a lot of them are customer facing. We've talked about Opendoor. Opendoor enabled homes or home sales for our company continue to accelerate. And the better we get at working with Opendoor, the more we're able to drive our cost down. And that's a benefit to our SG&A.","But at the same time, we're working with companies like States Title to improve the amount of time that it takes to get a title policy and to deliver documentation to our customers. And in time, though not yet, that will improve some of our financial services performances. We're using Blend to help our customer better access, the mortgage application process. And across our platform, there is just a number of technology opportunities to refine the way we do business and bring cost down incrementally. It's not going to happen in large steps quarter by quarter, but what we've been seeing is 10 basis points here, 20 basis points there over the last quarter year. And over years, you're going to start to see us become a much, much more efficient business because technology has made us better at what we're doing.","Matthew Bouley","All right. I appreciate all the details. Thanks again.","Stuart Miller","Okay. You bet. Why don\u2019t we take our last question?","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt of BTIG. Your line is open.","Carl Reichardt","Thanks very much. I wanted to ask two questions about California, I'll just ask one question with both of parts in it. One, just can you talk a little Stuart about how California performed for you? And then, with the move towards more lot options and what looks like a pretty significant move to smaller homes quick returns, does that impact at all how you think about California in terms of land mix and community mix on a long-term basis? How that might influence your thought?","Jon Jaffe","This is Jon. I'll take your question. So California in general improved, but it's really two different categories to think about when you look at California. The high end coastal markets particularly the San Francisco Bay Area and Orange County are still a bit sluggish. Those are the higher price points, you're talking $1 million-plus homes and heavily influenced by what's being impacted with the Chinese buyer. So those we're going to call it for what it is those remain sluggish.","The more eminent markets from the empire in the South in San Diego, up through the Central Valley and into Sacramento, those markets are all performing very well, very consistent with what Stuart described in terms of the overall market condition being solid. And we're seeing strength in market there much lower price points, say in the $400000 to $600000 price range is performing very well.","With respect to land in California, we're well positioned. It's not a market that really lends itself to a lot of growing option developed program. It's mostly owned developed land, but we do have given our scale in the respective markets. We've got very strong strategic relationships where there are opportunities for phase takedowns for long-term relationships. We're in every one of those opportunities throughout the state and maximizing it. But you're not going to see the same kind of volume on just-in-time land inventory that you'll see in a Texas or Florida market that's the land position is more set up for delivering that.","Carl Reichardt","Okay. Thanks, Jon. Appreciate it.","Stuart Miller","Okay. It sounds like we've come to an end. I want to thank everyone for joining us and we look forward to continuing to give guidance and understanding of our business as we go forward. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."],"12939":["Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 10, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Alexandra Lumpkin - IR","Stuart Miller - CEO & Director","Richard Beckwitt - President ","Jonathan Jaffe - VP & COO ","Bruce Gross - VP & CFO ","David Collins - Controller & Principal Accounting Officer","Analysts","Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities","Carl Reichardt - BTIG","Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates","Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI ","Peter Galbo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Operator","Welcome to Lennar's fourth quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now turn the call over to Alex Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statement.","Alexandra Lumpkin","Thank you, and good morning.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Operator","I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.","Stuart Miller","Very good, and thank you, Alex. This morning, I'm here with Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, Vice President and Treasurer; David Collins, our Controller; and, of course, Alex Lumpkin, from our legal staff who you just heard from. We also have Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto here. As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview, and then Bruce will give further detail. [Operator Instructions].","Today, I'm also going to ask Rick and Jon to give a brief update on our integration of the CalAtlantic strategic combination. So let me go ahead and begin by addressing the elephant in the room by highlighting our fourth quarter bottom line miss that derived from the shifting of a onetime noncore non-Rialto transaction. While this transaction is still covered by confidentiality agreement that restricts our ability to disclose its actual substance, we can say that it will produce more than the fourth quarter shortfall in the first quarter, and that profitability will benefit from the lower federal tax rate. Bottom line, this shift benefits the company overall.","Aside from the shifted transaction, we are very pleased to announce a very productive fourth quarter. We produced very healthy operating earnings, continued to track ahead of the target -- of target on our closed and fully integrated WCI transaction, announced our strategic combination with CalAtlantic, we began the preclosing integration process for that industry-transforming transaction, we continued to grow our LMC Multifamily business, and we continued to position Rialto for a future on its own.","Generally speaking, let me say it's a very exciting time to be in the homebuilding industry, and it's particularly exciting to be working here at Lennar. At Lennar, we're focused on every aspect of our business as we continue to migrate the company to a pure-play homebuilding platform. And we continue to innovate and evolve our core operations to perform at the highest levels in the industry.","Through the end of the fourth quarter, we were able to continue to execute on our business plan and strategy of growing and refining our business while focusing on our balance sheet. We ended the year with a net debt to total cap of 34.4%, even after paying all cash for our WCI acquisition at the beginning of the year. At the same time, the housing market has been strong, and it's getting stronger. There continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs have been created across the country, and wages have generally been moving higher. The low unemployment rate and the labor shortage has been translating into wage growth, and the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the same sense that we have as business operators, and that is that the economic environment is generally strong and stable and improving.","Accordingly, we've seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be at least in line with or above our expectations. Against that backdrop, the recently passed federal tax act has added additional momentum to the economic landscape. While many has been concerned about the effects of the new tax law on housing with its mixed bag of impacts, initial readings and reviews are suggesting that it is generally stimulative to the economy, and that is good for housing.","Concerns about the reduction of mortgage -- of the mortgage interest deduction, deductibility of real estate taxes and state and local taxes seem to be offset by overall optimistic momentum around economic stability and growth. We have carefully studied the specific impacts of the tax law on our typical buyer profile in each of our markets, and we found that the effect is generally positive at their income levels. Additionally, the doubling of the standard deduction should help a new group of frustrated apartment dwellers accumulate savings for a down payment to purchase a home and create personal stability.","We continue to feel that the strong economy, together with limited supply and production deficits from past years, have been and will continue to drive demand and pricing power as we move through the upcoming selling season, even though that will be somewhat offset by land and construction cost increases. This really sets the stage for a very successful strategic combination of two of the largest homebuilders in the industry.","As you've heard from us before, we are very enthusiastic about our combination with CalAtlantic. This transaction is all about creating leadership and scale in the markets that we know best and with the product lines that have defined our companies for decades. With scale, we believe we can drive both synergies and efficiencies as we build best-of-class operating platforms in the most strategic markets in the country. We believe we can use technologies to innovate and improve our operations to drive cost down. And we believe that we have the best and most experienced operating team in the industry to integrate these two companies quickly, efficiently and seamlessly to drive these efficiencies quickly.","Already, you are seeing that the two companies have not skipped a beat since the announcement of the transaction. CalAtlantic announced sales, closings and backlogs for the fourth quarter this morning and exceeded expectations across the board. Likewise, Lennar's sales were up 12% over last year's, deliveries up 5% and backlog up 17%, all above guidance. Both teams of professionals have continued to execute and remain focused on the business at hand while preparing for the closing -- the upcoming closing, on February 12.","In a break from convention on these conference calls, I'd like to spend some extended time on the CalAtlantic combination. Given the importance and significance of this combination and its integration, I have invited Rick Beckwitt and Jon Jaffe to provide transparency and give you an update on the progress of the integration planning and timing. I think you will see that we are focused on the details needed to move quickly and efficiently as we execute both on current and expected business accomplishments as well as the complex task of bringing two great companies and traditions together without missing a beat.","Rick, could you start off?","Richard Beckwitt","Thanks, Stuart. Let me start by reminding everyone that on October 30, we announced our strategic combination with CalAtlantic for $9.3 billion, which included $3.6 billion of net debt assumed. The consideration included 80% stock and 20% cash. After we announced the transaction, we issued $1.2 billion of senior notes to pay for the cash portion of the acquisition. As Stuart mentioned, we anticipate closing the merger on February 12, 2018.","Our strategic combination with CalAtlantic will create the nation's largest builder with latest 12-month revenues in excess of $19 billion. The combined company will have a top three position in 24 of the 30 largest markets in the nation with local market shares ranging from 20% to 40% in many markets. This local critical mass will drive huge savings.","During our due diligence period and since the announcement of the deal, we have been focused on integrating the two companies with a plan to drive both top line and bottom line performance. We have a detailed road map to recognize significant synergies through direct cost savings, reduced overhead costs, the elimination of duplicate public company costs, production efficiencies, and technology improvements. I'm happy to say that the CalAtlantic integration is right on schedule. Decisions have been made on regional presidents, division presidents, and all corporate and division personnel. In selecting all personnel, we had a deep bench of high-quality associates from both companies to choose from, and we selected the best player on the field regardless of which company they work for. We've already spoken with all of the senior associates with regard to employment decisions, and we will communicate with the remaining associates in the next two weeks.","When the deal closes, we will have five operating regions, up from our current four; and 38 homebuilding divisions, up from our current 33. The new divisions include two new markets, Indianapolis and Salt Lake City, and three new divisions to accommodate the largest scale and footprint of our operations. These new divisions include San Diego, the LA\/Ventura market, and Orlando. The operations in the remaining 33 markets from both companies will be combined into one division per market, which will result in significant synergies and operating leverage. However, from a personnel standpoint across our entire footprint, we've retained key purchasing and land acquisition associates from both companies since these associates will drive significant cost savings and drive our go-forward growth in the company.","We created an integration process and an execution team that includes leaders from both companies that touch all the relevant parts of our business. Our integration priorities have been technology decisions, land acquisition, product streamlining, EI conversion, value engineering and purchasing. We are well ahead of our time line in each of these critical areas.","From a technology standpoint, the go-forward operating system decisions have been selected. System conversions are already being mapped out prior to the closing and will start the day of closing. Our goal is to be operating on one system simultaneous with the build-out of our CalAtlantic tech line.","From the land acquisition standpoint, Jon and I and our regional presidents have been reviewing all significant land acquisition opportunities endorsed by the CalAtlantic division since the announcement of the merger. This has allowed us to have a consistent underwriting, leverage our product profile of both companies, capitalize on cross-marketing opportunities and benefit from our increased local market scale when negotiating the purchase of these land assets.","From a product standpoint, as we did in the WCI integration, we have been calling through the home plans from both companies to identify the most efficient and best-selling plans. We have analyzed each community to determine whether we would make higher returns and profits by building CalAtlantic or Lennar products. In most cases, as expected, our Everything's Included Lennar product is both faster and cheaper to build. In some cases, the CalAtlantic Design Center product offering commands a higher sales price with outsized margins.","Yesterday, Jon and I completed our review of the development, construction and marketing schedule of all of the CalAtlantic communities. Of the existing 566 CalAtlantic communities, approximately 41% will remain CalAtlantic, 50% will be rebranded to Lennar over the next several quarters, with the remaining 9% rebranded to Village Builder or WCI, which are our Design Center brands. All future communities will be sold under the Lennar, WCI or Village Builder brands.","To facilitate this product conversion and rebranding process, Lennar and CalAtlantic entered into a master construction agreement that allows each company prior to the closing of the merger to construct homes designed by the other company on land owned by the other company. Pursuant to this construction agreement, we've already begun to pull permits and start homes in approximately 45 communities across the country. This type of forward thinking has given us a jump-start on product conversion and will accelerate the opportunity for us to benefit from faster cycle times and lower build costs. Purchasing and value engineering is by far the most important driver of this strategic combination.","I'd like to turn it over to Jon now to walk through this important element of the deal.","Jonathan Jaffe","Thanks, Rick. We publicly announced that we expect to realize at least $75 million and $250 million in synergies in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, respectively. As reported in our S-4 filing, we told our board of directors prior to signing the merger agreement that we believe the synergies will be $100 million and $365 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, respectively. The majority of these synergies, $265 million in 2019, will come from lower direct construction costs. Given that the combined volume represents approximately 125 million square feet of homes per year, this equates to $2.12 per square foot, just a 3.7% savings from Lennar's current direct construction costs. Contributing to this 3.7% savings per foot will be the cost savings associated with Lennar's stand-alone volume as we would expect greater leverage as we increase our production from 75 million to 125 million square feet.","We have already put in place a world-class supply chain team made up of associates from Lennar, CalAtlantic and some new additions to the team. We are organized with a 15-member supply chain team, five regional purchasing vice presidents, three regional operating centers and our division purchasing teams. We will benefit from Lennar associates' experience in supply chain and Everything's Included execution and CalAtlantic associates who manages -- managed the supply chain integration of the Standard Pacific-Ryland merger as well as the Centex-Pulte merger. Lennar's three existing operating centers in Florida, Texas and California will be leveraged to officially process the purchasing activity of the larger organization.","We have a detailed road map by task and completion date to capture supply chain synergies, which prioritizes action items. We've already evaluated the national contracts between the two companies and created synergy targets by category. Meetings have commenced with strategic manufacturers and suppliers, and we have already started awarding national contracts based on the combined volume. This week, we are at the International Builders Show taking place in Orlando and one-on-one meetings with all of the major vendors. Plans are in place for the exploration of private label manufacturing, vertical integration of components such as concrete block, trusses and panelization, along with product value engineering.","Plans for SG&A synergies are in place with our operational structure set, as Rick described earlier. Additionally, when CalAtlantic communities are converted to Lennar's efficient Everything's Included platform, we'll gain more leverage as we will see an average cycle time reduction of 20 days as much as 50 days on the high side. This will increase the sales pace from two sales per month in those converted communities to a pace of 3.5 to 4 sales per month. The synergies of this combination will lower direct construction costs, reduce cycle times, leverage SG&A and increase sales base, all of which will deliver greater profitability and internal rate of return on invested capital. Based on where we are in the integration process and the plans are in place for execution, we're confident in our ability to deliver the cost synergies discussed in our S-4 filing for 2018 and 2019.","I'd now like to turn it back over to Stuart for some comments on this.","Stuart Miller","Great. Thanks, Jon. Thanks, Rick. So as you can hear from Rick and Jon, simply put, we are on it. We have broken down the critical elements of this integration, and we are executing exactly as you would expect from this team. As I've noted before, and we will demonstrate, continue to demonstrate as we go forward, we expect to bring these two companies together efficiently and effectively to build the best homebuilding platform in the industry and to drive savings and engaged innovation in the process.","So with that, to give greater detail on our financials, let me turn over to Bruce and to David.","Bruce Gross","Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the fourth quarter were $309.6 million or $1.29 per diluted share. The company's core operational metrics exceeded expectations. Excluding the strategic onetime transaction that Stuart highlighted shifted into the first quarter of 2018, we would have exceeded the consensus estimate of $1.47 by $0.04. This compared to fourth quarter 2016 net earnings of $313.5 million or $1.31 per diluted share, which was favorably impacted by energy credits.","Revenues from home sales increased 14% in the fourth quarter driven by a 5% increase in wholly owned deliveries and an 8% increase in average selling price to $387,000. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, we were impacted by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma, and we reduced our fourth quarter projections by 950 deliveries. Our operational team managed through this challenging period and were able to deliver approximately 400 of these 950 homes during the fourth quarter as operations return to normal.","Our gross margin on home sales in the fourth quarter was 22.4%, which was better than our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 23.3%. The gross margins have climbed year-over-year was due primarily to increased land and construction costs, partially offset by an increase in average sale price. Sales incentives improved 50 basis points to 5.7% with the improvement driven by our Homebuilding West segment.","Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our Homebuilding East segment, and direct construction costs were up 7% year-over-year to approximately $57 per square foot driven by approximately an 8% increase in labor and a 6% increase in material costs.","Our SG&A percent continues to drive lower as fourth quarter was 8.4%. This was the lowest fourth quarter SG&A percentage in the company's history, and this compared to 8.7% in the prior year. The improvement was primarily due to a decrease in external broker commissions as a percentage of revenue from home sales and improved operating leverage. Our operating margin for the quarter was 14%.","The joint venture, land sale and other category was a combined $12.4 million for the quarter compared with our guidance of $90 million to $95 million. This is the shortfall that we highlighted was attributable to the strategic transaction that will shift into the first quarter of 2018.","We opened 84 new communities during the quarter and closed 77 communities, to end the quarter with 765 net active communities. New homeowners increased 12%, and the new order dollar value increased 18% for the quarter. Our sales base was 3.2 sales per community per month, which was similar to the prior year.","Our dynamic pricing tool has enabled us to carefully manage our inventory again. And as a result, our completed unsold inventory decreased by 127 homes or 13% year-over-year to 848 homes, despite an increase in homebuilding volume. This calculates to only 1.1 per community, which is our lowest level per community since 2012.","During the quarter, we purchased 8,200 homesites, totaling $647 million. We continued with our soft pivot strategy. However, this quarter, we did have some larger strategic purchases in the West region, and our homesites owned and controlled now total 179,000 homesites, of which 141,000 are owned and 38,000 are controlled.","Turning to Financial Services. This segment had operating earnings of $42.1 million compared to $51.4 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $27.8 million from $36.6 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations decreased 9% to $2.5 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the prior year, while refinance volume was down 54% versus the prior year.","We have shifted to purchase business, which now represents 92% of our originations. The refinance drop has led to a more competitive origination and pricing environment. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% this quarter compared to 81% in the prior year.","Our title company's profit decreased slightly to the refinanced transaction to $14.6 million versus $14.9 million in the prior year.","The Multifamily segment delivered a $38.6 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $43.8 million share of gains from the sale of 2 operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 13 completed and operating properties and 35 under construction, 12 of which are in lease up, totaling approximately 14,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $4.5 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline of approximately $9.1 billion and over 25,000 apartments.","Our Rialto segment produced operating earnings of $2.2 billion compared to $8 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $46.4 million of earnings, which includes $14.2 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $32.2 million of management fees and other, which includes $10.9 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate Fund 1 and 2 now totals $119 million.","Rialto mortgage finance operations contributed $368 million of commercial loans into core securitizations, resulting in earnings of $14.3 million compared with $622 million and $35.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower volume and lower margins, 3.8% in the current year versus 5.8% in the prior year.","Our direct investments had a loss of $20.6 million as we continued to make good progress on monetizing the remaining assets from the FDIC and early portfolio purchases. We have now reduced the remaining REO and loan assets in the FDIC portfolio to approximately $25 million at year end, and all of the remaining assets are under contract to be closing in our first quarter.","Rialto G&A and other expenses were $31.6 million for the quarter, and interest expense, excluding the warehouse lines, was $6.3 million. Rialto also ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $242 million of cash.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.7%. The rate is higher than the prior year's fourth quarter of 32.5% primarily due to additional energy credits recognized in the prior year. The tax reform bill will reduce our effective tax rate in 2018 from the current 34% to approximately 25%. Excluded from the 2018 effective tax rate is a onetime noncash charge of approximately $70 million to be recorded in our first quarter of 2018 related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets as a result of the new lower federal tax rate.","Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to total capital of 34.4%, an increase of only 100 basis points year-over-year despite acquiring WCI for $642 million in an all-cash transaction at the start of this year. Our liquidity streams provide exceptional financial flexibility with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our $2 billion revolving credit facility.","During the quarter, we are redeemed $400 million of 4.75% senior notes that were due in 2017. And we also issued $300 million of 2.95% senior notes due in 2020 and $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due in 2027, to fund the cash portion in connection with the CalAtlantic merger and to the expenses related to the combination.","Stockholders' equity increased to $7.9 billion, and our book value per share grew to $32.81 per share. Before I provide 2018 goals, I wanted to turn the call over to David Collins, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. He will be providing purchase accounting details starting in our first quarter for the combination with CalAtlantic. We felt this is a good time for him to provide you with a primer on the purchase accounting process. So let me turn it to David.","David Collins","Thanks, Bruce. As part of the CalAtlantic acquisition, we will be required to evaluate the assets and liabilities acquired and record them at fair value on the acquisition date, which is expected to be February 12, 2018. These adjustments will include, but not be limited to, adjustments to inventory, investments in unconsolidated entities, other assets, goodwill and debt. Certain of these adjustments will impact our gross margins going forward. There will be a more significant impact to gross margins from the acquisition date through the early part of Q3 2018 as a result of the backlog writeup that is required for homes that have already been sold.","The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as the final purchase price, which is partially contingent on the value of Lennar's stock on the acquisition date, will impact the amount of goodwill recognized in the transaction.","We expect to have our provisional purchase allocation completed by the time we file our first quarter 10-Q in April of this year. The allocation is subject to change within a measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date.","We look forward to updating you on our first quarter conference call.","Bruce Gross","Now I would like to provide some goals for Lennar in 2018. Note that we will update these numbers in March at our first quarter conference call to include CalAtlantic. First, deliveries. We are currently expecting to deliver between 32,000 and 32,500 homes for 2018. We expect a backlog conversion ratio of approximately 65% to 70% for the first quarter, 75% for the second and third quarters and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We expect 2018 operating margins to match the 2017 level of 12.9%.","The full year gross margin is expected to be approximately 22%; and SG&A, approximately 9%. There will be seasonality between the quarters, with the first quarter being the lowest operating margin and then improvement as volumes increase throughout the year. However, the quarterly year-over-year operating margins should be fairly consistent with the prior year.","Financial Services are expected to be in the range of $160 million to $165 million for the year, and the significant decline in refinanced volume that impacted 2017 will continue to impact the first half of 2018 comparisons. As a result, first quarter and second quarter are expected to result in lower year-over-year earnings. However, we do expect to see year-over-year earnings for the third and fourth quarter to be higher.","Turning to Rialto, we expect a range of profits between $60 million and $65 million for the year. The second half of the year is expected to have higher profitability than the first half, and our first quarter is expected to be approximately $10 million.","Multifamily expects to sell 7 to 9 multifamily communities in 2018. However, these communities are smaller in size than with 2017 transactions. This should result in a range of profits between $50 million and $55 million for the full year. The first quarter is expected to be just over breakeven and then a small profit in the second quarter and a significant portion of the profit in the third and fourth quarter.","The category joint ventures, land sales and other income, as we look at this category, we expect approximately $100 million of profit for the year, primarily coming from the strategic transaction that shifted from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2018. The quarterly breakout is approximately $80 million in the first quarter with the balance spread over the last 3 quarters.","Corporate G&A is expected to be steady as a percentage of total company revenues year-over-year as we continue to invest in technology initiatives. And as I mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate for 2018 will be approximately 25%, excluding the onetime $70 million noncash deferred tax asset charge. Our net community count is expected to increase approximately 7% to 10% from our ending count of 765, with the increase spread throughout the year.","With our operating strategies and strong earnings contribution expected, we are well positioned to deliver significant cash flow in 2018. The use of cash in 2018 will be prioritized to first reduce debt. With these goals in mind, we are well positioned to deliver another strong, profitable year in 2018.","Let me now turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Stephen East from Wells Fargo.","Stephen East","I hope you can hear me okay. I'm also at the Builders' Show. So a ton of information here. So I guess, the first question is when you look at the S-4 as you walk through all the $365 million of savings versus the $250 million, you explained a lot of what was happening, but what was in the $365 million that was not in the $250 million guidance?","Richard Beckwitt","Steve, it's Rick. We were just being conservative as we were announcing the transaction to The Street. We're also very focused on other folks that might have an interest in doing the transaction, and we wanted to put on the table to our shareholders what we knew we could accomplish. And then since the -- we had more detailed analysis, we knew there was upside.","Stephen East","Okay. I got you. All right. And then switching to the gross margin. Costs up 8% in addition to labor being up 6%, surprised me a little bit. I guess, was that primarily the land drive? Or what else was driving that? And how the dynamic pricing play in the quarter, I guess, both from a gross margin perspective and the incentives level that you all reported?","Jonathan Jaffe","Steve, it's Jon. The bulk of that cost increase is really lumber increases that had taken place earlier in the year but were flowing through our cost of sales. So lumber, both labor and materials associated with framing, were up -- made up 32% of that 8% increase year-over-year. Lumber by itself was up 12% from June to September. Since then, lumber has moderated, and we don't expect to see that increase continue, but that's the major driver behind that. And of course, it will flow into margins as well as higher land basis, and particularly in some of our markets like in Inland Empire and Coastal California, so we do have that impact as well. Dynamic pricing, we're definitely seeing evidence that, that is, as we sell earlier in the process, that's driving our incentives down, which is helping attribute to a positive impact on our margins.","Stephen East","Okay. And can you quantify that or do you want to try to quantify that for us?","Richard Beckwitt","So we did highlight that sales incentives have come down 50 basis points year-over-year, and that was driven by the Western region that was a little bit ahead in using the dynamic pricing tool.","Stuart Miller","And you'll continue, Steve, to see incremental improvement as our dynamic pricing tool becomes more and more understood and adopted throughout the company.","Stephen East","Okay. As you all look at it now, Stuart, how much do you think you can capture, say, like in the next year to bring down those incentives?","Stuart Miller","I knew that would be the next question. We're going to sit, wait and watch and see exactly where it goes. It's with all of these initiatives. They are hard to predict. Their timing is even harder to predict. We've got 33 divisions, each implementing, and it's somewhat of a dance. So we're looking at incremental improvement quarter by quarter. And I just think that with each new initiative, we'll see how high it can take us or how low it can take us. And additionally, what new increments we can start to bring to the table with new improvements. So I think there's a lot of room for improvement from all of these initiatives.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt from BTIG.","Carl Reichardt","Jon, I wanted to ask you about the direct cost reduction that you've called out when you look at the merger. What do you think the savings split would be between labor versus materials versus other elements? Where is the leverage greatest in your mind?","Jonathan Jaffe","Well, from a prioritization standpoint, it's going to be on the materials side. We\u2019re first going to attack national contracts. Labor, because of the labor shortage that exists out there, it's definitely high up on the priority, but it's going to take a little bit longer to get the trades converted over to the greater volume and in which trades have the ability to expand into that. But as you look at the actual math behind it, it's probably split pretty evenly between the two categories.","Carl Reichardt","Okay. And then Rick, you were kind to talk a little bit about the changeover in the near-term communities for CAA. As you look at their longer-term land positions, what kind of flexibility do you have to alter product choice and then perhaps change mix over time? And I'm thinking about them being slightly more of a move-up focused than you, if I've got it right. Is there a chance that you could see more of that product move towards entry level as you bring it to market?","Richard Beckwitt","So in the go-forward deals, certainly, things that are platted or what have you, we have great flexibility in product selection. We got, in the Lennar world, move-up product. We have that in Village Builder brand and in our WCI brand. And there may be some CalAtlantic product that we ultimately convert to EI. So we have got great flexibility to do any at all. We, Jon and I, have spent a lot of time looking at individual deals, figuring out which ones we think we should increase velocity and put some lower priced product in there. So you'll see us do all of the above.","Jonathan Jaffe","And I would just add that, as always, it's going to be a community by community, submarket by submarket analysis of what produces the best returns, both margin and IRR.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates.","Ivy Zelman","On the detailed overview, it's extremely impressive, so thanks, Jon and Rick for that. I guess, my first question, maybe, Jon, you can talk about the benefits of scale. I know when you're the largest builder, you said in over 2\/3 of your market, so at least top 1 or 3 position. Assuming you get to see every land deal maybe before everyone else, can you walk through other benefits of scale? And then I have a follow-up, please.","Jonathan Jaffe","Sure. And we know this from the markets where we already have these dominant positions. As you said, Ivy, first and foremost is access to the land market where we have a priority position there. Equally important is we have a priority position relative to the labor supply. As you know from past conference calls, we have a very strong focus at Lennar, becoming the builder of choice for the trade partners, and we've already seen tremendous progress just based on Lennar's volume. The additional volume added to that, that takes us to up that 125 million square feet, I think is going to give us tremendous opportunity to truly become the builder of choice for the trades because we'll able to put consistent productivity in front of them, which is critical for their labor force to keep their peace workers focused on the job, building the same plans over and over. That's going to be a huge benefit for us.","Richard Beckwitt","And one last thing, Ivy, it's people. When you have the biggest, best operating machine, especially on the sales side of the equation, people want to come and sell homes in that operation. So we attract great new home consultants in the organization.","Jonathan Jaffe","And I would just add, too, because -- as we've talked a lot about on our calls, our focus relative to marketing, and really, the success we have had with social media and our online presence, that's going to be a tremendous leverage opportunity for this additional scale at almost no additional cost to be able to do the digital marketing effort that will bring in high-quality customers at even lower and lower costs.","Ivy Zelman","Great. That's very helpful. The second question, as you talked -- Jon, you mentioned opportunity for backward integration, concrete block, framing panelization, et cetera, maybe you could just take one of those as an example. I'm sure you've look at the investment and the return and the impact to profitability that you may derive from that type of backward integration. And I know it's a lot but maybe even the timing with the combination, obviously, only being finalized in February. Is this something that you think about in a few years? Or could it be [indiscernible]? So a lot there, but appreciate any response.","Jonathan Jaffe","Ivy, it's a little bit longer on the time horizon just because it's -- we have [indiscernible] carefully. We definitely are deep into the process. But if you look at Florida, as an example, we're going to build 15,000 homes in the State of Florida. There's tremendous opportunity with that scale to have activity in Florida that's vertically integrated. We will determine what those values are, and that will really create the prioritization of what goes first, whether it's concrete block in Florida, whether it's truss plans in Texas. Those are things we definitely will get to, and work is underway. But it's really premature to talk at any more detail right now.","Richard Beckwitt","I think what you'll see, Ivy, is we'll probably do some sort of mutual arrangement with someone to get in. And then as we understand the dynamics and the pricing of the business and flow-through, you'll start to see us do something on a stand-alone basis.","Jonathan Jaffe","And I'd just remind you, Ivy, we have Paul Dodge, heading up this whole effort. He's been on both sides of the equation. He's been on the supplier side as well as the builder side, so we have a good understanding of all aspects of what it'll take to accomplish this.","Stuart Miller","So the focus -- yes, just to finish up, Ivy, the focus has been squarely on driving the greatest savings through our cost structure. We're starting with the lowest-hanging fruit. It's going to be in and around the material side of the business and national contracts. Probably, the next level down is in and around local labor. The consolidation and becoming the largest concentrated local builder is really important in terms of consolidating the attention of the labor force. And this is going to be a big benefit and a strong local focus. So to us, that's kind of the second tier of low-hanging fruit. As we get to a third tier, and Rick, Jon and myself have been looking strategically at how we think about some elements of vertical integration that can change the way that we look at the building industry as we develop this core scale in each local market. Rick highlights in Florida believes that building 15,000 homes, that's scale. That enables us to do and look at a lot of things that we haven't been able to look at before in an economical way, and these will be drivers of savings at a third tier as we go forward.","When we talk about these various tiers, I hope you're getting the sense that the integration process and the focus is happening very quickly. The lowest-hanging fruit will be incorporated at the very beginnings of this combination. The second and third level will come quickly behind.","Ivy Zelman","No, that's extremely helpful. Just quick, I'll sneak in one more, Jon, you mentioned digital -- I'm sorry, digital marketing. And can you talk about how many hits a week or how successful you see from that initiative?","Jonathan Jaffe","I think the metric we look at as most impactful is the number of leads we get from that. That's people who actually ask for information. So versus hits, which is hard to tell what that leads to, but leads are people who are interested enough to ask for information. We are continuing to generate over 100,000 leads per quarter from our social marketing outreach program.","Stuart Miller","And let me just say parenthetically, from our viewpoint, the numbers that we're producing are impressive. We view ourselves as being in the very first inning of digital marketing and what we can do with it. So we are very focused on getting better and better at targeting and engagement. And we think that we can create a great digital conveyor belt of customers that are interested in our products. So there's more to come in this arena.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore.","Stephen Kim","Hopefully you can hear me well. I'm also at the Builders' Show. You've laid out some pretty impressive initiatives that you had been taking to try to get ahead of the integration. I guess, I was curious as to whether any of that has spread over into the land side of the equation. And if you could talk a little bit about what you envision for land spend for a larger organization, given some of the overlapping in existing markets that you will have. So just if you could comment on what you expect from the land spend side in terms of expectations, different from maybe Lennar stand alone.","Richard Beckwitt","So Steve, I'm not really prepared to give you a dollar amount yet because we're going through that now. But I can tell you that our entire organization from a division president, regional president, land acquisition teams are totally coordinated on the opportunities to drive growth. What makes deals successful, as Stuart has highlighted in the past, is, number one, integrating the operations and become a one company; number two, going after that low-hanging fruit; and number three, keeping machines going and growing. And when deals pause and stall out is because they're not focused on all of those aspects of the business. So as I highlighted in my commentary, we've gone heavy in purchasing personnel and heavy in land acquisition personnel and development personnel because that's the future of the company. Jon and I are reviewing the significant deals. Our regional presidents and division presidents are isolating those transactions, maximizing absorptions and pace and looking at value enhancement in each one of these deals.","Jonathan Jaffe","Steve, it's Jon. I'd also add that as we look at the process of integration, we have prioritized land acquisition as the absolute top priority from the perspective of analytics, underwriting tools, approval process, so that we can could hit the ground running and not skip a beat in terms of giving our teams, our operational teams on the field, the clarity of how they will go about executing the acquisition game plan.","Stuart Miller","And then let me just add as an overview here, Steve. I don't want you to think of Jon and Rick's primer or overview on integration as a group of initiatives. These are action plans. And the action plans have been constructed. They are being put in place. And I think that not skipping a beat is our primary focus right now. As it relates to land, there are land plans and land expectations being consolidated and put together at each divisional level. And it's as a primary focus as to exactly how many dollars we're going to be spending over the course of each next year in order to maintain the trajectory that's expected. We'll give better ideas of consolidated numbers after we close the transaction. Hopefully, we've been able to convey to you that the we're not waiting to close to come up with a plan. The plan is going to be well in place to be enacted the day we combine. And one last point, and that is, we're benefiting from just tremendous cooperation and professionalism from Scott, Larry and Pete. They are sourcing these opportunities. They're bringing them to our attention. They're out there actively looking to help the pro forma company to grow, and we couldn't thank those guys enough for their leadership throughout this whole process.","Stephen Kim","Great. No, that's very helpful. And it kind of gets -- as sort of as a segue to my next question, which is looking a little bit more at the construction in progress side of the equation. So I guess, first, kind of a two-part question, the conversion to you, Everything's Included, this is something you've done before, actually. And was curious if you could share with us how long do you think it takes as to sort of make a conversion from design studio to Everything's Included? Is there a learning curve, for example, with trades or with your supervisory staff? Are there sourcing contracts that have to expire first, which need to be integrated into Everything's Included? Those sorts of details, if you could just give us a sense for how long the conversion to EI takes. And then sort of a second question kind of embedded is I know there's a lot of concern on the part of industry, do you largely believe that you will be able to integrate CalAtlantic effectively? Just being a little concerned about the timing, the year, the time of year, the spring selling season, where you really need to get all your ducks lined up in a row. You've shared a lot, which gives us some comfort that you're not going to be caught off guard there. But just so if you could put maybe just specifically address anything that you're doing, recognizing that this is a super important time of the year to be going to market and going out with a bit of a unified strategy.","Stuart Miller","Steve, let me start off, and just an overview, Jon's going to kind of fill in some of the blanks. But in combination and integration, you've seen some of this with WCI. This is not an arbitrary race to get something done. This is an orderly strategic process of making sure that we keep the racecar on the track. And we make the changes incrementally as they are most effectively implemented. There is a differential between existing product and product that is to be started. And on existing product, there is a difference between communities that are just finishing up versus those that are just getting started. So the process of actually implementing Everything's Included is something that's going to be a part of an orderly process as it has been in the past. Jon?","Jonathan Jaffe","So it starts with a game plan community by community that we'll look at. Rick was highlighting some of this in his comments to which communities it makes sense to lead as the existing CalAtlantic product and build through and finish them out in their design studio format. And then which communities does it make sense and when to transition over to Everything's Included product. Now to your question about how difficult that is, that Everything's Included project is already existing in the Lennar portfolio, right? It's not something we have to create. We know it, and we know in each market. Now remember, one of the strategic reasons we are really excited about this combination is its markets we know and its products we know. So we know the products. We also know the Everything's Included levels in those markets. We've done that research, and so that will be a consistent, somewhat seamless transition to just put the Lennar product and the EI package on an existing CalAtlantic community.","So some will continue out as appropriate to finish out as CalAtlantic product, and then bulk of the transition you'll see in the second and third quarters when we switch over to EI product. It's my expectation that as we turn the corner into 2019, virtually 100% of our starts will be Everything's Included product or under the Village Builder or WCI brands.","Richard Beckwitt","And Steve, one final point. It's -- I think it's important for you to realize that we really only have two markets in this whole operational -- operation combined that have never done EI. That's Salt Lake City and it's Indianapolis. In all of the other markets across the nation, we've got personnel that know how to do this, know how to design it, know how to build it, know how to source it, know how to purchase it. So this is not a new thing.","Jonathan Jaffe","Not only that. It's Jon again, obviously. Those divisions -- all divisions are supported by regional presidents that know this product and market with obvious exception of one CalAtlantic regional president that's coming over. But he and all the other regional presidents will be supported by purchasing teams, national and regional, marketing teams, national and regional, that really know our Everything's Included platform inside and out.","Stuart Miller","And look, as just as a follow-up, Everything's Included is not -- it's not an easy thing to just adapt or adapt to or adopt. We've seen a number of builders try to copy what we do. It's a process. It's a process on the sale side. It's a process on the production side. There are learned behaviors. They will be implemented and learned over time. Everything's Included is an attractive program. It's a marketing and production program. It's attractive because it really has big benefits on the production side. It will take some time. It will take some learning, but we're very confident that the implementation will be orderly.","Stephen Kim","Great. And what about the spring?","Jonathan Jaffe","What do you mean, Stephen, what about the spring?","Stephen Kim","Just is there anything particular that you are doing or are planning to become that reflects just some of the challenges of entering the spring selling season as opposed to, let's say, doing this at a later time in the year? Maybe where the industry isn't quite so much gearing up with generally a much more aggressive posture? I was just curious if there's anything about the spring that affects the way you go and approach the integration.","Richard Beckwitt","Yes. So Steve, I think that really gets to the importance of this master construction agreement that we signed with CalAtlantic. We have 42 communities across the country already permitted and starting homes right now that's Lennar brand. This has never been done in the [indiscernible].","Stuart Miller","Yes. And let me say, as it relates to the spring, Steve, I think that the single most important thing is at each community level that there'd be certainty, okay? The communities are already purchased. The product is pretty much in place. We're not going to cloud the spring selling season with a lot of uncertainty. The mapping of the exactly what each community is going to be doing is already being set out. As we enter the spring selling season, there will be certainty at each community level, and we'll be prepared for the spring, if that's the question.","Jonathan Jaffe","And just one more comment, addresses your question, but I think, really, all of these questions. We are already commencing what we call community operations reviews. So our management teams, the new combined management teams are going around every community, meeting with the sales team in that community, construction team, the customer care team, to understand exactly where that community is, really confirm the road map and make sure everyone is on the same page, everyone is rolling in the same direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Lovallo from Bank of America.","Peter Galbo","It's actually Pete Galbo, on for John. Bruce, I think you mentioned an 8% increase year-over-year on labor cost, and that was up from the 5% you mentioned in 3Q. I was just wondering if there's anything more in that outside of the disruptions from the hurricanes pushing up labor costs or any other material changes happened in the quarter.","Jonathan Jaffe","It's Jon. I'll take that. So like you said, the bulk of the increase even affecting the labor side is happening in the framing component. There's nothing unusual on that, I would say. Even relative to the hurricanes, there is trade hero there that have increased prices relative to that, I think gets pulled into the repair business. But by and large, it's just the continuing trend of the labor constraint against a improving homebuilding environment.","Peter Galbo","No, I appreciate that. And again, appreciate all the color on the topic of integration. I guess, Stuart, just taking a higher 10,000-foot view here. You now have two builders that are effectively double the size of your next largest competitor. And just wondering how you guys are thinking about -- with everything else that's going on, how you're thinking about how your competitors may respond, the smaller competitors may respond to changing dynamic that you guys have kind of set out here on.","Stuart Miller","I think that the way we're configured, we have our eyes squarely focused on our business. And we're not all that focused on the competitive response. As you come around the halls of Lennar, you will see that we are very independently focused on how we're configuring our company for the future. It's not just this combination and the seamless execution that we expect of ourselves. It's not just preparing for a spring selling season, making sure that there's certainty at the division and at the community level with product in place and ready for the spring selling season. It's also about the number of initiatives that we have on track concurrently, even while we are integrating, focusing on our digital marketing strategy, enhancing beyond 100,000 leads per quarter to something much greater than that. It's about a dynamic pricing tool that is going through implementation at just Lennar divisions and ultimately, combined divisions that will redefine the way that our business operates, driving SG&A lower and profitability higher.","We are thinking way outside the competitive landscape box to think about how we can -- I've said it over and over again, how we can build a better mousetrap. And so the competitive response from the rest of the market is of less consequence to us than how we can vertically build a better program that is something that the homebuilding world hasn't yet seen. And we think that the key to the kingdom for us is, in large part, this local concentration and scale, the ability to build that concentration and to rebuild both production lines, sales approaches, marketing approaches and internal operations to build a better program for homebuilding going forward. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it from 10,000 feet.","Jonathan Jaffe","And supporting that, supporting Stuart's comments on what we see in front of us, this is something that's not so obvious to everybody, and that is the people and the culture at Lennar. And what we have is a group of people that are really enthusiastic and excited about these challenges and opportunities in front of us that are welcoming and looking forward to the CalAtlantic associates joining their teams, and there is just overall enthusiasm about what we're taking on and the opportunities.","Stuart Miller","All right. So listen, in conclusion, I just want to thank everyone for joining us. I think that you can see that we've been very focused on integration, focused on our business, and we'll continue to be that way. I do want to say, as a parting comment on this call, that the efforts that we've articulated have been efforts around both companies. And the tireless work of Scott and Larry and Pete, especially Jeff McCall, who we haven't even mentioned yet, and the many, many associates at CalAtlantic that we look forward to getting to know better and work with, it's just been a very impressive and -- partnership to build the business platform as we go forward. We're really enthusiastic about this combination. We're enthusiastic about what it does for us in the short term and where it can take this company in the long term. And as Scott Stowell joins our Board of Directors and as we begin moving forward, we're very enthusiastic about the business, and I think that's come through on this call.","So thank you for joining us. We look forward to giving you future updates as we close this combination on February 12, as we continue to integrate and ultimately, as we report quarterly progress going forward. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Sir, you may begin.","Stuart Miller","Great, thank you, David. This morning, I'm with Rick Beckwitt, our President; Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dianne Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and of course, David Collins, who you just heard from. And we also have Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto here and Eric Feder, from the Rialto Group; John Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; is also with us by phone from California and will participate in the Q&A portion. ","As always, I am going to start with a brief overview, Bruce will deliver further detail, and we\u2019d like to ask that during the Q&A portion that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible in the hour allotted. ","So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are very pleased to announce a very strong earnings for the second quarter, with strong and balance results being reported by each of our operating segments. While in our first quarter, we noted that the somewhat sluggish overhang from the end of 2016 had negatively impacted margins and therefore our operating results. ","We felt that the market was improving, as sales picked up throughout the first quarter. We anticipated that the spring selling season would be solid and that we would in fact see improved results as the year progress. These are exactly the conditions that drove our results for the second quarter. ","We have continued to see strength in the housing market through the second quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins exceed our initial expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market, there continues to be a perception that jobs are being created across the country and that wages are generally moving positively.","We often discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into a sense that many job sectors compensation is moving up and while much of the data collected by the government doesn\u2019t seem to reflect significant wage growth. The customers visiting our welcome home centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment. ","There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that the governmental pro-business environment will result in at least job security and possibly some tax relief as well.","Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the sense that we have as business operators that the economic environment in general is strong and stable and improving. The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery continues to seem to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal. ","We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years are now intersecting with land and labor shortage and we started to see some pricing power as we have moved through the selling season, somewhat offset however by construction costs increases.","Additionally the economic realities of a constrained and supply of housing options and the economic realities of higher rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision making for the first time home buyer as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market. ","Across our platform each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market as we look ahead through the remainder of 2017. We are expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow to mature and to improve as we enter the back half of the year. ","Against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. To begin, our for sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Deliveries for the first quarter increased 15% and our gross and net margins improved 40 basis points and 130 basis points sequentially.","In the second quarter, new orders were up approximately 12% year-over-year, driven by higher sales pace of four homes per community per month versus 3.9 last year, combined with a community count growth of some 6%. Interestingly, our strongest markets Portland, Seattle, Inland Empire, Coastal California, the Bay area, Tampa and Southeast Florida, all had a sales pace of over five homes per community per month.","We continue to gain stronger results, powered by our focused strategy on driving better quality traffic to our digital marketing efforts. Today, our social media outreach generates internet leads that now surpass 100,000 per quarter. And that is driving our marketing and advertising spend, which is now down year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters. We continue to operate at a very high level of operating efficiency and we're continuing to focus on improving from here. ","Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We saw the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during this quarter as we exceeded home delivery expectations by reducing our completed unsold inventory by 17% without sacrificing margin.","As you've heard from us in prior quarters, we're using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model, fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives as well. We continue to focus on overall operational efficiency driving our SG&A to historic lows for our first quarter and now for our second quarter as well. We're simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time. ","In addition, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter and the integration, which is being guided by Rick Beckwitt and his team led by Fred Rothman and Darren McMurray is progressing exactly as planned. WCI will continue to contribute to earnings as expected as purchase accounting and non-recurring cost dissipate and as cost benefits and SG&A savings accumulate. ","Overall, our core homebuilding strategy remains to pivot our land strategy towards shorter term land acquisitions and to maintain a 7% to 10% growth rate for the company, while we enhance our operating platform by reducing SG&A. Parenthetically, given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rate should be on the higher side or little bit overall goal for the year. ","Additionally, we are focused on expanding our first time homebuyer offering with our mix now standing right at around 40%. Combined, these strategies -- these strategic elements will produce very strong cash flow for the company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement.","Let me turn briefly to our Financial Services segment. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the second quarter as it contributed operating earnings of almost $44 million.","Of course, the business is growing and lockstep with our homebuilding operations and with the addition of the WCI acquisition as the refi business has diminished over the past year Lennar Financial Services is continuing to expand its non-Lennar business reach and bottom-line to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation will give additional color in just a few minutes. ","LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, our Multifamily Apartment segment has continue to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $6.5 million of earnings in the second quarter driven by the sale of one of our merchant build apartment communities. While we have continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we also have grown LMV our build-to-core program, which is cash flow focused on building an apartment portfolio.","In the second quarter, we started 1,140 apartment homes in 4 communities, with the total development cost of approximately $520 million. As of May 31st, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 76 communities, totaling approximately 23,600 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.2 billion.","These included 37 merchant build communities totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion. And 39 LMV build-to-core communities totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $4.1 billion. Our Multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations.","Turning to Rialto, Rialto contributed $6.2 million to the bottom-line this quarter versus a loss a year ago. Rialto's investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base as well as harvest value for investors and for us.","Our first two flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers. We are also pleased that our third opportunistic fund held its final closing with approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments and it has already invested or has under contract 33 transactions involving the investment of over $600 million of equity. And to complement our opportunistic funds, we also have over $1.1 billion of investor equity dedicated to investment CMBS, mezzanine and transactional lending, which we also will be looking to grow this year.","On the Rialto Mortgage Finance side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF, which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 39th and 40th securitization transactions during this quarter with net margins averaging 5.8% selling over $392 million of RMF originated loans.","Our direct investments should be winding down over the next quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses. Going forward from that point our focus will be solely on our investment management and RMF business segments there.","Finally, FivePoint successfully completed its IPO this quarter and now enters the public market as a pure play California, master plan community developer. We expected overtime the value embedded in the FivePoint management team and its extraordinary asset base will be realized as the appreciation cycle of these extremely well located communities will be revealed through transparency and public filings. Certainly from a Lennar perspective the new stock symbol FPH will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet.","Finally in conclusion, across the platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our second quarter and we're feeling very optimistic about the reminder of the year. We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across the platform on the strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market in the near future. ","Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform and strengthening market conditions. People, assets and operations are all align to perform in 2017 and we look forward to keeping you updated.","So with that let me turn over for greater detail to Bruce.","Bruce Gross","Thanks, Stuart and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $213.6 million or $0.91 per diluted share and this compares to second quarter 2016 net earnings or $218.5 million or $0.95 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.02 per diluted share impact due to a lower 32.2% tax rate as a result of energy credits available in the prior year.","Revenues from home sales increased 18% in the second quarter, driven by a 15% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 3% increase in average selling price to $374,000. As Stuart highlighted, our Homebuilding team used our new technologies and a strong sales season to focus on selling deliverable inventories. This resulted in a significant increase in our expected backlog conversion ratio to 86% for the quarter.","Additionally our completed unsold home inventory dropped by 224 homes or 17% sequentially from the first quarter. This focus on deliverable inventory resulted in an acceleration of home deliveries that were previously expected in our third quarter. ","WCI contributed 388 deliveries to the quarter and that was about 70 more than were expected. Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 21.5%. We are on track with our previously stated goal of 22% to 22.5% gross margins for the full year. The prior year\u2019s gross margin was 23.1% and the decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land and construction costs. Our gross margin percentage was impacted 20 basis points due to write up of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the quarter. ","Sales incentives year-over-year were consistent 5.7%, but improved sequentially by 20 basis points from our first quarter. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our homebuilding east segment. Direct construction costs were up 5% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot, driven by an approximate 7% increase in labor and 4% in material costs, driven primarily by lumber.","Our SG&A percent in the second quarter, was consistent with the prior year at 9.3%, which was a record low. We're continuing to improve SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from our focus on our technology investments through the company. Included in our SG&A for the second quarter were transaction related expenses to the WCI acquisition, which had a 20 basis points impact. ","Other income net was $3.8 million compared to $13.7 million in the prior year. In the prior year we did have a profit participation from one of our homebuilding consolidated joint ventures that drove most of that profit.","Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $21.5 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur general and administrative expenses, while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 86 new communities during the quarter and closed 102 communities, to end the quarter with 736 net active communities. ","We continued with our soft pivot strategy as we\u2019ve purchased only 7,500 home sites, totaling $371 million in the second quarter and our home site count owned and controlled now totals 167,000, of which 136,000 are owned and 31,000 and controlled.","Our Financial Services business had strong results, with operating earnings of $43.7 million compared to $44.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income decreased slightly to $32 million from $36.8 million in the prior year, mortgage originations were $2.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year. ","Refinanced volume was down 48% compared to the prior year, leading to a more competitive origination environment. The capture rate of Lennar home buyers was 80% compared to 83% in the prior year. ","Our title companies profit increased to $9.7 million during the quarter from $7.4 million in the prior year, driven by an 8% increase in revenue and operating leverage from these higher revenues. And then our new Florida realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated $2.2 million of profit during the quarter. The spring selling season quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year for this business.","More detail on Rialto, this segment produced $6.2 million compared to last year\u2019s loss of $13.8 million both years are net of non-controlling interest. The investment management business contributed $42 million of net earnings, which included $5.8 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and, and $36.3 million of management fees and other, which includes $11 million of carried interest distributions.","At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate funds one and two now totals $119 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $392 million of commercial loans into two securitizations, resulting in earnings of $15.6 million compared with $386 million and $12.7 million in the prior year respectively.","The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the average net margins and the securitizations from 3.6% in the prior year to 4.2% in the current year. Our direct investments had a loss of $13 million, as we continue to focus on monetizing the remaining assets from the early portfolio purchases.","Rialto G&A and other expenses were $32.1 million for the quarter and interest expense was $6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with the strong liquidity position with $120 million of cash.","The Multifamily segment delivered a $6.5 million operating profit during the quarter primarily driven by the segment\u2019s $11.4 million share of gains from the one operating property that was sold, as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses. ","Our tax rate for the quarter was 33.8%, which included a favorable resolution with the IRS. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 32.2% due to the energy credits in the prior year. And we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the remainder of this year. ","Turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet remained strong with the net debt-to-total capital of 40.7%, a decline of 280 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with $748 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. This facility was amended during the quarter to extend out to five years and to increase the commitments to $2 billion, which includes a $400 million of accordion feature. ","During the quarter, we retired our 12.25% senior note maturity of $400 million, which was due June 1st, with the proceeds from our new issuance of $650 million of 4.5% seven year senior notes. This results in an annual net cash interest savings of $31 million per year. We intend to use the balance of the proceeds to redeem the 6.875% senior notes that were acquired with the WCI transaction. This redemption will likely occur at the next call date in August. Stockholders' equity increased to $7.3 billion and our book value per share reached $31.23 per share. ","Now I would like to update our goals for 2017. We are right on track to deliver between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. Given that we accelerated closings from Q3 into Q2, there is a smaller population of homes available for delivery in Q3, and therefore we expect the backlog conversion ratio to be similar to 2016 second half conversion ratios, which was 75% for the third quarter and close to 90% for the fourth quarter.","We are increasing our average sales price guidance to between $370,000 and $375,000 for the year. We are still on track to hit our expected operating margins of around 13% for the full year. The full year gross margin is still expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect our third quarter gross margin percentage to between 21.75% and 22%.","We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line to be between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year. The third quarter will have some non-recurring transition cost relating to the WCI transaction and therefore we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.3% again in the third quarter. The fourth quarter however should realize the largest leverage given our higher expected volume for the fourth quarter.","Financial Services despite a large decline in refis we are on track with our financial services goal of $160 million for the year, with the third quarter expected to be $45 million to $50 million.","Turning to Rialto, Rialto is now expected to generate profits of approximately $30 million for the year, with the third quarter expected to be in a range of $3 million to $5 million. Multifamily is still on track to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year, the third quarter is expected to be approximately $5 million of that number.","And joint ventures land sales and other income, as we look at this combined category, we still expect to range at $70 million to $80 million of profit for the full year. The third quarter is expected to be profitable in the range of $0 million to $5 million and the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits in this category.","Corporate G&A is on track to still be 2.2% to 2.3% of total company revenues for the year and our community count is still expected to be approximately 770 to 780 communities. The balance sheet is well positioned to end the year with strong liquidity and similar leverage as 2016. So as you can see we are well positioned to achieve our goals for the remainder of 2017.","So with that, let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ivy Zelman. Your line is now open.","Ivy Zelman","Thank you, good morning guys, congratulations another solid quarter. Stuart you mentioned in your opening comments that roughly 40% of the business was really geared at the entry level segment and just talking about what\u2019s happening from a pricing perspective, there has been an acceleration in pricing really throughout the year from January to through the spring selling season give the strength. Is there a level of price appreciation that can concern you as affordability is still attractive.","I mean how much run rate do you think you have, you mentioned your technology on pricing. Maybe you can give us some flavor around an apples-to-apples comparison what you are seeing in the start of market. As I hear lot of questions about concerns about the rapid rising appreciation and concerns that it may look like \u201813 when the market got to agree just [ph] and pricing was getting a little ahead of its ski. So if you can comment there and then I have a follow-up. Thanks again.","Stuart Miller ","Sure, look I think that -- I think it\u2019s clear pricing has been moving up and even the line between first time and move up buyer is starting to get a little blurry and has been moving up over the past couple of years.","I think that -- I am going to turn over to Rick and Jon to give some color from the field. I think generally speaking we are seeing that people though the pricing is moving up people are finding that the affordability from employment wage growth and general economic factors is increasing as well and enabling people to come to the market. Rick?","Rick Beckwitt","Yes, hi Ivy, so if you look at the quarter, our sales prices were up about 5% on overall aggregate basis and granted some of that impacted by mix. But as you look at the entry level product that we\u2019re dealing in our major markets, we\u2019re able to offset the efficiencies production associated with the price increases in those communities. So we are having a pretty well balanced program right now and really on track with the underwriting that we\u2019ve had. ","Stuart Miller","John, you want to weigh in on that.","Jon Jaffe","Yes I would just echo that the consumer sentiment is really a driving factor right now and we\u2019re not seeing spikes in appreciation that are causing concerns and we\u2019re really not seeing that at the mortgage table. So, I think it\u2019s typical housing follows jobs and wages and that\u2019s really a tailwind that we have right now.","Ivy Zelman","Great. And my follow-up Stuart, the question for Stuart as it relates to sort of capacity knowing that the U.S. housing market is still significant deficit what's needed shelter for single family and retail is extremely tight and very constraint with days on market falling below 30 days according to NAR.","One question comes up a lot in meetings as you'll hear from clients is, okay, now all the builders you're the prettiest growth advance if you're building within the FHA loan mermaid and there is not enough supply so everybody is going there. From your perspective, is there a room and depth for now the industry all rushing to go to the BE and even see rings of the market and give us some comfort that there is not going to get a crowding situation or saturation.","Stuart Miller","I think there are some governors out there IV and we've mentioned this in past conference calls. I think there is the limitation on land availability, land pricing that yields to affordable housing. I think there are labor shortages generally. I think that while demand is continuing to grow, I think there are some limiters on how quickly the production can keep up and can expand to meet that demand.","The question is to whether there is going to be a flood to B and C locations, there are certainly more demand for those locations as the market expands. As we've highlighted before, it's our strategies to stay inside those outskirts. And so we think that our strategy is really well crafted for where the market is going and we certainly don't want to get way out on the outer trenches. Rick you want to add to that?","Rick Beckwitt ","Yes, and it's all about the overall land strategy. We try to stay ahead of where the market is going. I\u2019d like the think that we're one or two steps ahead of where the industry is. And as a result, we've tied up as we've talked about in the past. A lot of contiguous land through option contracts that put us in a good position as the market evolves. ","Ivy Zelman","Okay, great. Good luck guys. Thank you very much for taking my questions. ","Rick Beckwitt ","Sure. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Robert Wetenhall","Hey, good morning. Tremendous quarter. Wanted to ask Stuart and Rick and Jon, how much operating leverage is left in the model? You called out dynamic pricing, you're obviously having great success leveraging the SG&A side of the business with some of the new social marketing initiatives you're undertaking.","What's left, because you guys made great strides in the short amount of time. It seems like all levers are working in the business. Can you get a better net margin in say the next 18 months or two years due to the fact that you got favorable operating leverage, the pricing environment seems benign, if not outright positive. And you're doing a great job of leveraging the cost structure. What's left to extract from the business in terms of net margin in the current environment?","Stuart Miller","So Bob, I would turn the sentiment around and say that we feel that we're at the very beginning stages. We are articulating our successes relative to digital marketing and now dynamic pricing because we can point to some tangible effects that people can latch on to. But this is a big strategic initiative within the company. We feel that we're at the very early stages, very early innings of what I said in my comments building a better mousetrap.","We think that there is a lot more leverage. I think it arrives from a lot of smaller initiatives adding up overtime. And as they become more provable, we'll start to put them on the table. I don't want to start getting out over my skies or creating false optimism it has been done before.","But as we prove these up, we're talking about them a little bit more. I think that many know, many people know that this is a very big strategic focus for the company. And we think that we can produce a lot of operating leverage and bring our operating margins up. I don't want to quantify it, but we don't think it's tens of basis points we think it's much bigger than that and it will be overtime. ","Robert Wetenhall","That's good to know, thank you. And for a follow-up question, you guys have the successful IPO of FivePoint earlier this year, and it seems like some of the ancillary businesses are maturing nicely and I wanted to ask you Stuart, what's your vision of the business in say the end of 2018 or 2019, you've called out a reversion to pure play as a homebuilder back to day six? And it seems like the other ancillary businesses are maturing nicely. How do we think about the trajectory of how this plays out in say the next 18 to 24 months, what are your expectations? Thanks and good luck.","Stuart Miller ","Thank you. So, we\u2019ve highlighted in past conference calls that we\u2019re very focused on reverting to pure play to the pure play homebuilding model. Of course we\u2019ve talked about the IPO of FivePoint, we think that brings growth transparency and visibility. But we\u2019re working every day on some of the other components of our business.","You've heard us talk a lot about LMC or multifamily apartment rental program, that program as we move through our merchant build assets and migrate towards our build-to-core strategy this sets up an opportunity for us to maintain this strategy within the company if it strategically make sense as a core asset or to do some kind of alternative transaction and that can very well happen over the next couple of years.","On the Rialto side, you\u2019ve seen the buildup of our investment management business, you seen the buildup and execution around Rialto Mortgage Finance and you are seeing a very focused strategy on liquidating our core holdings our assets that where we invested Rialto capital. So that we're going to reduce that business to just those two core business lines of RMF and investment management.","And as we do that we come to the end of 2017 the next few quarters, we're really going to have something that will be able to be either combined IPO or spun out and we look forward to doing that over the next couple of years as well. So, we think as we look forward expect to see a refined pure play homebuilder over the next couple of years.","Robert Wetenhall","Got it. Thanks and good luck.","Stuart Miller ","Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Dahl from Barclays. Your line is open.","Anthony Trainor","Hi, this is Anthony Trainor filling in for Mike. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong quarter. So, just wanted to talk a little bit about this gross margin ramp in the second half. Is there any way you can provide kind of the puts and takes around what\u2019s driving the step up from 2Q to 3Q and then kind of how you guys get from 3Q or 4Q in order to maintain this for you guys any type of -- anything you can help us in terms of the bridge there would be great.","Bruce Gross","Probably the biggest impact on margin is the amount of field expenses that are absorbed given the increased volume closings. That combined with the fact that generally we enter the year with a little bit lower sales pace and we\u2019re able to push pricing throughout the year. It's a very typical seasonal pattern.","Anthony Trainor","Great. And then I guess there was further follow-up, you mentioned that the East has the highest gross margin percentage, do you have what the Central gross margin percentage is relative to the full company. Because given that backlog value in the Central region is not down year-on-year. That should be a smaller portion of revenues in the second half.","Stuart Miller ","We haven\u2019t broken that out by region, but that\u2019s something on a follow-up I could certainly talk though with you.","Anthony Trainor","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Buck Horne","Hey, thank you, good morning. I wanted to ask a strategic question of sorts pretty well known a competitor has made a pretty intriguing strong different external land development platform. And I\u2019m kind of curious how you see the market over the next couple of years for land development and finished lots evolving. And would it make some senses for Lennar to develop its own external platform or partnership for finished lots notwithstanding the relationship with FivePoint in California.","Stuart Miller ","So, I think you are talking about the four star news that's out there as those of you that don't know Starwood Capital has that as a merger agreement to acquire that company. Another builder has recently announced that they have an interest in trying to put something together that buys the majority of the company and run it as a land bank type of machine that would feed that company.","It\u2019s an interesting set of cards, we really don\u2019t want to comment on the viability of that platform or the stub piece that would trade in the market, but as we look at we have had absolutely no problem sourcing land. We do a lot of partnerships and have a tremendous depth of connectivity with the land sellers and land developers out there. And we think that we\u2019re going to continue down our path and continue to grow the company.","Buck Horne","That\u2019s perfect. Now that\u2019s exactly what I was trying to ask about, so I appreciate you\u2019re reading through those lines. And last, I\u2019d like to just go back to WCI, just for a second. How do you see the integration, I guess, progressing from here in terms of growth plans or acceleration of community activity and maybe if you can add some color about what you\u2019d like to do with the WCI tower pads going forward as well?","Rick Beckwitt","Well on the integration front, as Stuart said, we\u2019re exactly where we planned again if not a little bit ahead of schedule, the only integration that\u2019s left is really some backend IT stuff the fine tuning on integrating the accounting and control assumptions. Although from an operating standpoint we are one company right now, we\u2019re continuing with the WCI brand because we think that there has been increased ASP growth on those communities. ","From a targeted standpoint with regard to the pads, we have one of the towers under construction right now, that\u2019s doing really well, once we entered the sales season. And our plan is to -- if the market is there to continue to build and develop out that business. WCI is a power house in those markets and with our expertise especially on our multifamily side since we do a lot of high rise in the multifamily business. Now we are able to arbitrage costs that will make that business even stronger. ","Stuart Miller ","Let me just add to that and say WCI really is a textbook merger and combination integration story, it happened very quickly, very efficiently. We are as Rick says up, we are one company at this point. The positive side of that is that we have clean and clear operating strategies going forward. And the two pronged programs that lead to the best operating results and that is the ability to apply our construction cost preferred customer approach to dealing with subcontractors is really going to benefit the WCI business going forward.","And the SG&A leverage that we have been improving on the Lennar platform, we think better than others is going to help leverage the additional volume that we see from WCI in the future, getting the integration behind us quickly and efficiently really enables us to take advantage of those two strategic advantages. And we think we\u2019re going to see that going forward.","Buck Horne","That\u2019s great, thank you very much for the comments. ","Stuart Miller ","You bet. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","Stephen East","Thank you and good morning everybody. Bruce you talked about expected strong cash flow this year, could you give us an idea of what type of magnitude you\u2019re talking about this year and next year and as you all rank quarter your options for that kind of usage of that cash?","Bruce Gross","So let me start, we haven\u2019t given next year\u2019s numbers out yet, although we expect next year to be strong as well. But for this year we talked about approximately $0.5 billion of operating cash flow and one of the things we said at the beginning of the year as we were comfortable paying all cash for WCI and that was a $643 million acquisition. So that was one of the primary uses of the operating cash flow for this year.","We expect the leverage by the end of the year to be similar to the prior year so that will put us in really good shape as we enter '18 and we'll give that updated guidance in our fourth quarter.","Stephen East","Okay, fair enough. ","Stuart Miller ","So [indiscernible] Steve, we are very focused on cash flow generation. And focused on really improving the balance sheet as we go forward.","Stephen East","Okay. And along those lines Stuart, I guess I'll ask a different version of Buck's question. When you look at FivePoint do you see a vehicle that in this cycle could expand away from California and into other parts of the country and maybe act as a partner with you to maybe continue or accelerate your soft pivot somewhat?","Stuart Miller","That's -- first of all FivePoint today is a strong independent company with a strong Chief Executive Officer, Emile Haddad. And I certainly don't want to take away from his articulation of strategy. But having been on the road show with him now for a few weeks I do feel that I can comfortably say that FivePoint strategy is to remain focused as a California pure play master plan community focused developer. It has a strong complement of assets that it is focused on today.","And it's not going to be distracted by a land strategy for Lennar or any other builder across the country. It's going to stick to its core competence. We endorse that strategy for FivePoint, we think that's how they're going to drive bottom-line and execute their strategy in the public markets as they've articulated it. So they are -- for those who might think about the Four Star strategy and applying that to a FivePoint that\u2019s just simply not our thinking about strategy nor is it the articulated strategy of FivePoint. ","Stephen East","Fair enough, that's extremely helpful. And if I could sneak one other in, you all have talked in the past reducing floor plans, your labor hours with technology becoming more of a manufacturing process et cetera. Do you see with the labor issues continuing and probably continuing for good chunk of this cycle. Do you see a fundamental change in the way you build i.e., more penalization modular whatever the case maybe.","Stuart Miller","Jon leads that, a lot of that effort and he has done extraordinary work there. Jon, why don't you take that?","Jon Jaffe","Sure. Really, we explored those options every day, we have a supply chain team that's very focused from the beginning of the process through the end. There really hasn't been a realization in the area of modular or prefabing, but yes, we continue to explore that. The opportunities that we're seeing are really eliminating the waste that\u2019s in the supply chain by forming very close relationships with the suppliers and manufacturers and recalibrating that to drive some efficiencies.","And that's what we see over the near to medium term and perhaps longer term there will be some technologies that enable some change. But remember, our factories out in the field home site by home site. So it doesn't lend itself the same way that some other manufacturing processes do to the advance of technologies. ","Stuart Miller","Within our environment, we've really engineered and Jon has sphere headed using our everything included marketing strategy as a mechanism for creating Lennar as a builder of choice among subcontractors. And we've built a lot of partnership to be able to strategize in how we can breed efficiencies into our building process and our cost structure. And I think we've made some meaningful inroads along those lines.","Stephen East","Okay, thanks a lot. I appreciate that Stuart. ","Stuart Miller","You bet. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open. ","Jack Micenko","Hi, thanks for taking the question. With the FivePoint ownership, obviously you brought into some more on the deal. It might be a technical question, but I think it has ramifications to the bigger Lennar story that\u2019s kind is some of the part story. You didn't step up the value of FivePoint on your balance sheet. I know it's a long-term position, how do we think about how you realize that value now it's a public traded entity longer term the value that position?","Stuart Miller ","Well, look, number one I think that transparency associated with FivePoint being a public company. That really helps our shareholder base understand its horsepower. Now that story is going to evolve over the next quarters and years as residential lands are sold, as infrastructure improvements add to value, as the cycle of appreciation embedded in master plan communities really reveals itself through quarterly conference calls and accomplishments. ","Our shareholders are going to be able to see FivePoint\u2019s improvement through the transparency and articulation through the public markets. I think that FivePoint\u2019s strategy as it\u2019s been articulated is very focused. There is excellent management team in place. We are happy to number one, be invested in the assets that are -- that make up FivePoint, invested in the management team that makes up FivePoint and we think that giving California\u2019s land constraint, we\u2019re going to have -- we\u2019re going to see tremendous appreciation overtime.","Jon Jaffe","And let me just add the technical part of that question, the difference between the basis on our books and FivePoint books is recognized when there is a third-party sale from FivePoint that difference will be recognized by Lennar.","Jack Micenko","Okay, thank you that's helpful. And then, looking at the backlog the ASP is up about 6% year-over-year, looks like some acceleration there, is that the pricing power you are speaking off or is that WCI mix or maybe a little bit of both?","Stuart Miller ","It\u2019s a little bit of both. We are seeing some mix, but we are seeing some price appreciation, the 3% this quarter gave us the confidence as we looked at our backlog the increased average sales price for the rest of the year. So, it\u2019s a little of both.","Jack Micenko","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut ","Thanks, good morning everyone.","Stuart Miller ","Good morning.","Michael Rehaut ","First question, just about sales pace throughout the quarter, if you kind of take the average community count, I know this is kind of in an exact science, but just using methodology consistently, we\u2019ve sales pace up roughly 3% year-over-year that compares to up 5% last quarter. ","Just curious if you see anything different in terms of how at least on a year-over-year bases, was that kind of modest improvement, kind of consistent throughout the quarter again a percent here there it is, is not too material. But was there any change as you saw it versus the versus the first quarter, as we kind of focus on the pace year-over-year is kind of getting a better picture of year-over-year demand and change in demand?","Stuart Miller ","Jon, want to give prospective there?","Jon Jaffe","Yes I think you saw the traditional spring selling season that strength as you look at year-over-year and the slight uptick in comparison just show that this year was a little bit stronger reflective as our earlier comments seeing in consumer confidence, wage and job growth all reflecting an increased traffic at our welcome home centers, increased convergent rate of that traffic. So all building to a slightly stronger sales pace.","Michael Rehaut ","And nothing different that you saw during the quarter?","Jon Jaffe","Pretty consistence, the quarter strengthened from the first month to the second two months, but pretty consistent over the quarter.","Michael Rehaut ","Great. And then just secondly on the ASP, I think you kind to talk about 2Q the improvement being a little bit mix and pricing driven and that's what drove your confidence to increase the guidance for the full year. Just want to clarify that increasing in about $5,000 per home. Is that also kind of in some ways both mix and pricing driven and is it right to assume that you are not necessarily increasing your gross margin guidance because you may perhaps that's being offset to the extent that there is a little bit of pricing there, it\u2019s being offset by continued inflation or how should we think about that?","Stuart Miller ","There is always a question around mix versus price appreciation when you are rolling up numbers from across the country and it\u2019s very hard to disentangle. I think that there is some offset with construction cost and labor cost and everything else, it\u2019s really hard to get these margin numbers and everything perfectly refined as we look ahead and it moves around through the quarter. ","So, it is as you said in your prior question Mike, it\u2019s in exact science and I think we\u2019re all kind of trying to look ahead to what the trend looks like. Generally speaking we\u2019ve seen some initial pricing power, some initial sense of pricing power. But remember that you also have the offset of construction costs and labor costs that are moving in tandem. So we will see how the quarter unfolds, we have given the best guidance that we can at this point. ","Michael Rehaut ","Great, thanks so much. ","Stuart Miller ","You bet. I think we have time for one more question. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ","Stephen Kim","Thanks very much for squeezing me in guys. I wanted to follow-up on that, I think earlier in the call when you were addressing pricing, you were talking about the entry level of the market and I thought that I think it was Rick saying that you were able to offset costs with price there sort of suggesting that margins were stable to maybe slightly positive trending.","In this context of a mortgage rate environment that\u2019s kind of surprised us over the last six months in terms of coming down fairly meaningfully. I am assuming that probably wasn\u2019t baked into your guidance as well. Are you a little surprised that you haven\u2019t been able to recognize more pricing power at the entry level particularly?","Rick Beckwitt","Well Steve, that\u2019s not exactly what I said, what I was trying to say and let me just backup. We have always articulated that the entry level is a lower margin business given that it\u2019s that type of business. We are continuing to see pricing power in that first time segment, what I was really trying to get to is given the fact that it\u2019s an easier simpler product to build with less Foo Foo [ph] in it if you will, it helps us from a margin standpoint. ","Stuart Miller ","We don\u2019t use Foo Foo, well, less specialness on the outside let\u2019s say. ","Stephen Kim","Right. ","Stuart Miller ","Just easier to build, faster from the production standpoint. ","Stephen Kim","Okay. ","Stuart Miller ","Next question, Steve. ","Stephen Kim","Okay, got it. But within that could you address the interplay of mortgage rates and the obvious impact on affordability and how that affects your pricing dynamic then, in that segment of the market?","Rick Beckwitt"," So I think you are starting to see the buyers in that segment come to the table a little bit better organized, where they have their financing documents enrolled, they have got a little bit higher qualified buyer universe out there. And that\u2019s helping offset some of the pricing increase that we\u2019re able to do, because they have got -- they are just better organized and positioned.","Stuart Miller ","Let me add to that and say that, I think, Jon highlighted earlier that a lot of what\u2019s driving people to the market is a sense of confidence, it\u2019s animal spirits, it\u2019s the notion that all of this is in exact science, interest rates and affordability and wages and pricing all play a part and what people can afford and how the math actually works out.","But the confidence that people bring with them to the table about whether their job is table and whether there\u2019s going to be a wage increase or there is opportunity for them to move and be mobile to the next job opportunity. Whether they have been to able accumulate a down payment or in excess of a down payment, or whether their family members that are able to help support with the gift or something else, all of these are moving parts that define this in exact science that we are all trying to kind of define going forward.","So it\u2019s kind of hard to wrap all of our heads around where the market is going, but the general trajectory is positive and even at the first time buyer level as the millennials start to unwind their doubling up and come to the market realizing that rental rates have gone up and there is a real reason to go ahead and purchase. That first time buyer segment is showing some optimism and some ability to be flexible in and around the affordability levels and as prices move up. I don't know if that's helpful or not Steve, but\u2026","Stephen Kim","Yes that was just what I was getting at. So that's very helpful. The second question I had related to technology and I know you've done a lot of work there and it's come up a few times on this call and it's an area of great interest for us.","I think that you had mentioned -- so you called out two areas in particular, I think digital marketing and dynamic pricing. And you said there were some others, but within the digital marketing, I think you've pointed that marketing spend was down year-over-year for 10 straight quarters and in dynamic pricing that you reduced your standing inventory 17% without a negative margin impact.","And I guess I was curious as to when you take those two, digital marketing and dynamic pricing, are those the metrics that you're primarily monitoring that you think are the most important for assessing the effectiveness or your programs there? Or is there -- are there other very important metrics that we should be thinking about as it relates to those two. And when you mentioned other initiatives outside of those two, are there any general areas that hold the most promise that you think that we could be focused on?","Stuart Miller ","Well, first of all let me say I'm so happy to hear that people are listening to my opening remarks and you did reside back to the -- as you have clearly listened. Look, these initiatives are really core to what we are working on day-to-day inside the company. And your questions are good one, the answer is that those metrics are the starting metrics for those two initiatives, but they are not the only metrics for those two initiatives. There are other embedded metrics that we're working at.","So relative to digital marketing, the very first thing was proving that we could improve our traffic particularly the quality of traffic. Put aside the quantity for a minute, but the quality of traffic while reducing the spend. So it was really can we cut the spends by 50 basis points while we improve the quality of the traffic and continue to grow our business.","And that was the beginning metric, but as we become more proficient at digital marketing and as we can expand the flow of qualified traffic I highlighted 100,000 customers, qualified customers coming to the doors driven by social media and internet marketing. As we can expand the number coming through the doors, we are probably going to be able to see greater pricing power and other efficiencies as well.","And I'm not going to go through and start articulating those matrices, but we think there is more firepower in the digital marketing strategy and we are very focused on that on a regular basis. ","Likewise with the dynamic pricing tool, what you're seeing in a reduction in standing inventory is a starter, but the ability to sell homes that are not standing inventory at the end of quarters helps elevate the need to use discounting mechanisms or incentives to move that inventory.","And so as we move forwards with those digital tools or technology tools, we think that there is more firepower in them. But we have a whole host of initiatives of that we're working on, that we don't articulate. Because we're simply not getting out over our skies, but we are telling you that we're working on these things every day and we are committed and think we will build a better mousetrap.","Stephen Kim","That's great. Thanks very much for that, appreciated. Good luck. ","Stuart Miller ","Okay, you bet. Thanks Steve. And I do want to say thank you everybody for joining us. We look forward to keeping you updated as we move through the rest of 2017. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
