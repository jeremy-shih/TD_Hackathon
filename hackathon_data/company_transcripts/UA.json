At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Lance Allega. You may begin.","Lance Allega - Under Armour, Inc.","Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone joining us on today's call to discuss Under Armour's fourth quarter 2016 results. I'd like to remind everyone that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in this morning's press release and documents filed regularly with the SEC.

We provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and in the electronic version of portions of the script from today's call, both of which are available on our website at uabiz.com.","Joining us on today's call will be Under Armour Chairman and CEO, Kevin Plank; our CFO, Chip Molloy, and Dave Bergman, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin Plank.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thank you, Lance, and welcome to our team. As many of you know, Lance has exceptional experience in our space, and we believe that his leadership along with Carrie Gillard will enable us to further strengthen and better communicate our story moving forward.","In addition to our earnings results this morning, we also announced that Chip Molloy has decided to leave Under Armour for personal reasons. With this marking Chip's last call, I'd like to say thank you and wish him well in his future endeavors. Chip will continue to serve in an advisory role for a period of time.","Dave Bergman, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, has been named as our acting CFO effective February 3. With more than 12 years at Under Armour, Dave has incredibly deep experience across multiple senior roles within the core financial functions of the company. The board and I have high confidence that he is exactly the right person to provide continuity, and ensure no disruption to our operations.","And with that, good morning everyone. 2016 was a strong year of performance for Under Armour. We marked our twentieth year in business. Added sports marketing assets like Cal Berkeley, UCLA and the Southhampton Football Club in the English Premiership. Announced a new relationship with Major League Baseball. Debut the Under Armour Sportswear collection, gained incredible brand visibility at the Rio Olympics with U.S. gymnastics and Michael Phelps. Approached 200 million users in our Connected Fitness community, and hit $1 billion in both our footwear and women's businesses. These are just some of the outstanding accomplishments that we had in 2016 that we're fiercely proud of as a brand.","However, 22% topline growth driven by a 15% increase in apparel, more than 25% growth in our DTC business, and 50% growth in footwear doesn't describe the whole story and shapes the way the year played out for us, specifically our fourth quarter.","While it's certainly not new news, throughout 2016; bankruptcies, channel dislocation and destocking combined to disrupt the overall North American retail landscape. We're still a very young company internationally, and 85% of our global revenue comes from North America. So a large exposure, but with 63% growth, we have momentum toward greater global balance.","Before diving into what happened in the fourth quarter, I think it's important to level set using our last call. When we spoke with you in October, through the first nine months of the year, we were on track to hit our full year targets. We had just come off a very strong back-to-school selling season where we saw momentum in the Under Armour business, despite some challenges in the market.","Following the liquidation of a major partner, we believe that lost market share would be absorbed by other parts of our business and saw signs to that effect throughout the year. And as we looked out to the fourth quarter, we were bullish in our assumptions, based on a long-standing history of auto replenishments, and at higher full priced cold weather product and DTC traffic built-in.","So first, I'd like to explain a few things. What happened, what we learned, and what we're doing about it? So let's start with what happened. In the fourth quarter, slower traffic caused significant promotional activities earlier, deeper and broader than expected. This commoditized some of our more basic core product that had previously sold through for us in years past. This, in addition to higher demand for more lifestyle silhouettes caused us to be out of balance with our assortment. So we lost top line volume as we work to adapt through our mix and pricing.","Now to be fair, we did comp positively in the quarter in both our retail stores and our e-commerce channel, but ultimately the result was below original plan. There was also lower channel recapture of bankruptcy volume that we had expected as pricing came down in the points of distribution that we serve. And finally, we say out of balance with our cold-weather product assortment that was on the floor, which in years past have been able to absorb through full price sales.","So what have we learned? We learned there's a greater opportunity for better differentiation among our basic core product to better cut through the noise. We learned that our segmentation strategy could be sharper, that being premium at every price point and having the right product for the right consumer at the right time is the price of admission. And we learned that when we play in a discounted environment, we can drive volume, and win, but the role both we and our retailers expect us to play is as a premium full price brand. We were also validated by the fact that as our strong portfolio of footwear, international and DTC growth engines scale, we will be better positioned to deal with imbalances like this going forward.","We know that we own this. So what are we going to do about it? We're working to evolve our selling strategy to better align with what consumers want, with what consumers need. Tacking our 2017 assortments to ensure that our largest volume drivers are in better balance with fresh, new product on the floor at key points in each season. This is our merchandising functions' key priority for the year. This means amplifying our agenda for newness and innovation at every price point as our partners expect Under Armour to be the premium brand of choice in their stores.","We're also accelerating our lifestyle product offering to capture broader demand, and we're working within our new category management structure to be better merchants and closer to our consumer.","All this said, we have a responsibility to perform every quarter. We have an imbalance due to the function of our extreme growth that we see as a massive opportunity at its core. We understand very clearly the root causes and reasons behind this imbalance, are humbled by it, and as the fastest-growing brand in our sector over the past 20 years, absolutely have a pathway through it to emerge even stronger going forward. And it's a pathway based on a record of success, a dedicated and talented management team, incredible brand strength, and a smart and diversified growth strategy.","And with that, I'd like to take a few minutes to underscore the strength of our business strategy and reflect on our thinking around the current environment and our largest growth opportunities going forward.","I want to be clear: our growth story is intact. Our brand is truly stronger than it's ever been, and we are actively managing our growth. We are in command of the things that we can control, and yes, operating in an environment with many things that we can't control, but what you won't from us today are excuses, hope-based expectations or complacency.","But you will hear about the deep foundation we built for growth, and the confidence that we will capitalize on our competitive advantages. Moreover, while we will continue to optimize our business and demonstrate prudent investment, there is no change to our growth strategy or investment thesis which remains laser-focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth and creating value for our shareholders.","The investments we've made and continue to make in talent, architecture and systems from SAP's enterprise resource planning platform, Connected Fitness and our merchandising capabilities. Two, our move toward category management in 2016; the addition of DCs, or what we call at Under Armour distribution houses, and supporting the incredible growth of our international business. These are the investments, the backbone of a $5 billion company building a $10 billion infrastructure.","Very rapidly, we delivered industry-leading innovation, significantly accelerated our footwear business, expanded our direct to consumer channel, broadened our global wholesale distribution, grown our lifestyle offering and have gained strong traction in our international business. And these efforts are paying off. In fact, we've over-delivered against our own expectations in these strategic growth areas, including a 31% five-year revenue CAGR for our DTC business, 41% for footwear, and 53% for our international business.","Importantly, each of these areas grows by keeping our consumer centrally aligned with our business and evolving our organization and capabilities along with them when, where and how they train, compete or express their own individuality. We continue to strengthen our foundation and capacity to meet their demand.","Being a growth company means that we're in a constant state of evolution. In 2017, we will remain on offense by continuing to invest in our fastest-growing businesses and leveraging our unique strengths and competitive advantages, and we have a lot of advantages: innovative product, brand strength, a broad base of premium sports marketing assets, unparalleled consumer connections and a strong, strong management team.","Staying on offense, however, does not mean growth at any cost. It means striking an appropriate and responsible balance for the health of the brand in the near and long term.","In the near term, we expect to add about $600 million in revenue this year, but based on all the factors we experienced in the fourth quarter and looking toward 2017, we expect operating income to be down by about $100 million. So the natural question is, why? Why is operating income going backwards? That is what we believe to be the near-term cost to ensure our path to becoming a $10 billion brand. So let me explain why it's important to pay this price now.","First, operationally. Given lower than anticipated revenues, while we are immediately taking measures, we can't reduce our SG&A spend enough in the near term to match our revenue opportunity for meaningful impact in 2017.","Second, strategically. We believe it's critical that we maintain our investments in innovation in our footwear, international and DTC to ensure we reach the opportunity that we see for these businesses. Again, that doesn't mean we're investing with disregard to the bottom line, but instead we are making a strategic choice to take advantage of this environment to position ourselves to lead within our industry, build a stronger company, and safeguard a pathway toward more consistent future value for our shareholders.","Over the last 20 years, Under Armour has experienced tremendous growth. As our product diversification and geographic and retail expansion strategies continue to gain critical mass globally, our business has gotten more and more complex. In my office here in Baltimore, I keep white boards. I use them as a way of organizing my thoughts, ideas, business plans and strategies. And recently with all the things written on them, I cleaned them all off, and I wrote just one phrase: make UA simple. And that's just it. As we pass through $5 billion on our way to $10 billion, we must get better, faster and smarter at what we do, why we do it and how we do it. And in a way, that is simple and humble.","So in addition to maintaining appropriate investments in our largest growth drivers, we have begun to work across all areas of the company to look for opportunities to calibrate, streamline and prioritize our business toward a stronger, leaner and more responsive organization.","In summary, our strategy positions us well to navigate the near-term challenges in our largest market while ensuring the underlying momentum stays squarely on track to drive consistent, profitable growth in our fastest-growing businesses to lift all boats in the harbor. Our goal is to take UA from a great brand with good operations to a great brand with great operations. We've got some work ahead of us, and we'll use 2017 to focus on increasing our operational discipline as we look to build out our $10 billion business.","Now I'll turn it over to Chip and Dave to provide a deeper dive on the financials and our outlook, and then I'll come back with some closing comments after the Q&A. Chip?","Chip Molloy - Under Armour, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin. Today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results before handing it over to Dave, who will provide an updated outlook on 2017.","Starting with our fourth quarter. Total revenue was up 12% to $1.3 billion. Clicking down into revenue by product type, for reasons Kevin detailed, apparel revenue came in lighter than we had originally anticipated with an increase of 7% to $929 million. We did see strong results from our sport categories including golf and basketball.","Footwear revenues increased 36% to $228 million, as both running and basketball delivered strong growth driven by more premium product offerings. And, revenues for accessories increased 7% to $104 million with solid results in our bags and headwear businesses.","Looking at revenue by channel. Sales to our wholesale customers were up 5% to $742 million, a result moderated by the challenges in our North American business that we've spoken to today. Our direct-to-consumer revenues grew 23% to $518 million, representing approximately 40% of total revenues for the quarter. We finished the quarter with 241 owned stores globally, consisting of 188 Factory House and 53 Brand House locations.","Revenues for our licensing business grew 20% to $30 million, and Connected Fitness revenues grew 8% to $18 million. On a regional basis, North American revenues, which are 82% of global total, increased 6% to $1.1 billion. It's important to note that North American apparel is still our largest and most profitable business by far. Accordingly, less than expected growth in this area disproportionately pressures our overall growth rate which we saw in the fourth quarter.","Our international business continues to deliver strong top-line results as we elevate and expand our brand reach around the world. With a 55% increase to $215 million, our international business reached 16% of total revenues in the fourth quarter. Excluding currency, revenues were up 60%. The continued momentum we saw in the fourth quarter across all of our international regions, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, gives us increasing confidence in the investments we have made and the strategy we have executed against to scale our brand around the globe.","Turning to margins. Fourth quarter gross margin decreased 320 basis points to 44.8% compared to 48% in the prior year's period. The decrease includes a negative impact of approximately 230 basis points, driven by higher discounts and promotions partially offset by continued improvement in product input cost, and about 90 basis points of negative impact from the continued strength of our footwear and international businesses, which carry lower margins.","Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 9% to $420 million, an increase predominately driven by investments in our direct-to-consumer business including both physical and digital concepts, and infrastructure necessary to support our strategic growth initiatives. The overall SG&A increase was lower than planned due to incentive compensation.","Fourth quarter operating income decreased 6% to $167 million. Interest expense for the fourth quarter increased to approximately $8 million compared to $4 million in the prior year's period. Within other expense, we recorded a loss of $1.7 million in the current year versus a loss of $2.2 million in the prior year. In addition, the tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33.2% compared to 38.4% in the prior year, due to a higher mix of international sales and profitability, and a tax benefit related to our prior year acquisitions. And finally, fourth quarter net income decreased 1% to $105 million.","On the balance sheet, total cash and cash equivalents for the quarter was $250 million compared with $130 million at December 31, 2015. Inventory for the quarter increased 17% to $917 million and total debt was up 22% to $817 million.","Looking at our cash flows, our investments in capital expenditures was $92 million for the fourth quarter compared to $85 million in the prior year's period.","Moving on to the full year. Revenues in 2016 grew 22% to $4.8 billion, up 23% on a currency neutral basis. By region, revenues in North America were up 16% and international revenues grew 63% to reach 15% of our overall business.","By channel, wholesale revenues grew 19% to $3.1 billion . Our direct-to-consumer revenues grew 27% to $1.5 billion and was approximately 31% of total Under Armour revenues for the year. Licensing revenues grew 19% to $100 million and Connected Fitness revenues grew 51% to $80 million.","Full year gross margin declined 160 basis points to 46.5%. The decline was primarily due to actions to better manage our inventory including discounting, especially in the back half of the year. Mix shifts toward our footwear and international businesses, which carry lower margin, also negatively impacted margin, partially offset by our continued focus on product input cost improvements.","Full year SG&A grew 22% to $1.8 billion and operating income grew 2.9% to $420 million. Net income decreased 11% to $259 million.","I'll now hand it over to Dave to provide our updated outlook for 2017.","David Bergman - Under Armour, Inc.","Things, Chip. Starting with revenue, based on the macro factors we've discussed on today's call, and proactive actions to manage inventory levels down in the marketplace, we expect full year revenues to be up approximately 11% to 12% to nearly $5.4 billion in 2017.","Excluding currency impacts, revenues should be up about 12% to 13%. Similar to 2016, we expect our footwear, international and direct-to-consumer businesses to be the largest drivers of our topline results outpacing the total rate of growth as we further scale and expand these businesses.","Next, gross margin. We expect our 2017 gross margin to be down slightly, as expected benefits and product costs are offset by anticipated changes in foreign currency and continued sales mix shifts as our footwear and international businesses continue to outpace the growth of our higher-margin apparel and North American businesses.","Changes in foreign currency are expected to pressure gross margin throughout 2017, but we believe we will be able to offset some of this margin pressure through our continued focus on product cost improvements along with reduced promotional activity, especially in the back half of the year.","Given the near-term investments that we are maintaining in SG&A, we're expecting operating income of approximately $320 million in 2017. You've already heard it a few times today, but I will make the point again. We are a $5 billion business that has been rapidly investing toward an infrastructure capable of supporting a $10 billion company. Along these lines, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and have a pathway to get us there. At the core of this journey is a constant, unwavering commitment to protect and do what's right for the brand.","Accordingly, we believe it is prudent to maintain our key investment strategy focused on growth, share and scale. However, this inflection point provides an opportunity to manage the operations of our business differently and strive to be a more effective and efficient organization. Consequently, we are evaluating our capital spend and our operational processes and their associated impact to our overall cost structure with a focus on streamlining and removing complexity, while protecting long term growth investment areas.","We've already begun this process and can see some of the initial results of our efforts through targeted areas like capital expenditures. For 2017, we're planning CapEx of approximately $400 million, which reflects a significant reduction from the run rate we laid out at our last Investor Day. Beyond CapEx, we are working through the rest of the business as well to uncover and maximize the critical areas necessary to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and run a more operationally effective company.","With respect to our full year effective tax rate, we're assuming a 32% to 34% range. Also to note, due to the magnitude of discrete items within the first two quarters, including the required implementation of accounting rules related to the tax treatment of equity compensation, we expect the rate in the first half to be significantly lower than the full year. We plan to provide more details on our first quarter effective tax rate in our 10-K as filed in February.","Next, I want to provide a little more color on the first quarter, starting with revenue. We anticipate the first quarter to grow at a mid-single digit rate as fourth quarter conditions in North America carry over and will have not yet lapsed some of the significant bankruptcies we saw in 2016.","We're expecting first quarter gross margin to be down almost 100 basis points year-over-year as many of the same factors from the fourth quarter pressure our margins, including foreign currency impacts and higher promotions and discounts. Given the expected run rate of SG&A, we are expecting a first quarter operating loss of approximately $12 million to $14 million.","Finally, a comment on inventory in 2017. In our efforts to manage the brand appropriately for the marketplace, we are planning for inventory growth to be higher than revenue growth for the first three quarters of 2017 and coming more in line with revenue growth during the fourth quarter.","In closing, I want to reiterate the commitment our team has to driving the right level of investment to deliver prudent, long term sustainable growth, while also becoming a more operationally efficient company.","With that, I will turn it back to the operator to open up for Q&A. We ask that you please limit your questions to two per person so we can get to as many of you as possible. Thank you.","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Good morning, Omar.","Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC","First one, Kevin, if we think back to your last Investor Day, and you guys really pushed the accelerator pedal looking across the board at all the different various opportunities ahead for the company, international, women's, e-commerce, youth, Sportswear, Connected Fitness, footwear, the new headquarters, on and on. At this stage given the bump in the road here, is it time to kind of refine that focus, and think about maybe the top two or three, or three or four, growth opportunities that are most scalable in the next few years and then allocate both financial and human resources accordingly? Or is it kind of stick to that same plan?","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Now I want to be clear that, first of all, the investment thesis that we have of investing in the growth drivers, and we talk a lot about the success that we've seen in footwear, international, DTC and so we're of course doubling down on those. But some of the other bets have not come to fruition yet, and the ones that we are still investing and are still curating.","At the same time, watching things that \u2013 we made similar comments years ago in talking about things like our footwear and our women's business which both crossed $1 billion this year. So I think that we've built \u2013 when we established a lot of credibility, we're showing you that when we put in and make investments that they definitely bring return. And some of them, frankly, haven't happened as quickly as we wanted to.","When we think about some of the shifts of what we've been investing in, we were a North American company. And go back just, 2014, 9% of our business was outside the United States. In 2015, it was 11%, and 2016, 15%. As we look forward to 2017, we expect that number to be approaching and crossing 20% of our business. And so the move from North America to rest of the world is something we're proud that we've invested in. And we think it's prudent to continue to make those current investments.","The move that we made from performance in the lifestyle is one where this began more than three years ago, and we still see that we're not quite there with everything that we want to do, but we've made massive strides with the launch of Under Armour Sportswear, the leadership we've put in place in building out the team. And then also I think the move that we've made from wholesale to direct consumer, these are just some of the investments that have proven for us to the point that I want to be clear is that we're not sitting here saying that, we're just going to slam our fists on the table and invest in anything that we see. We want to be prudent. We are business people. Our eyes are wide open. We are unemotional about this, but we also want to make sure we continue to invest in and protect the brand.","We have without question one of the strongest brands, obviously, we believe in our industry, and we're going to make sure that that happens. And frankly, some of the things that we've seen, which was a very top-line-driven focus as to get to these to allow us to continue to invest in the brand, we've seen a little bit disrupted just because of the nature of where and how we're selling and the environment that's been created around it with promotion. And so that's some of the balance I think that we've been dealing with as a company, is making sure that we are prudent, we're thoughtful, we're protecting the brand, and that we are leaving ourselves the room to grow.","And so, of course, we're going to be prioritizing investments. There will be things that will come off the list, and we feel good about the pieces that we're in right now. But we're going to begin with tightening our own belt in SG&A and some of the obvious ones, but we feel confident about our ability based on our track record to continue to make the right decisions of where that means and where that matters.","Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then could I ask just another question, maybe if you could expand on a comment you made I think in the prepared remarks around some trends going on in the apparel business, maybe moving away from performance more to fashion or lifestyle? I know that UA Sportswear line is still kind of pretty nascent, but maybe elaborate on what you're seeing from that standpoint. Is there some pretty deep going on at the consumer level? A shift towards more fashion-oriented athletic apparel versus performance oriented? Obviously, Under Armour is known for its technical performance. And if this is the case, how do you evolve the brand a little bit to be really relevant on both sides of that fence?","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think there's \u2013 I think that performance was something which was, when I look back at it, we're a company that was founded in the equipment section of a sporting goods store. and then we evolved to the apparel section. And then all of a sudden it became something that wasn't just for a football player, or a baseball player, or a lacrosse or soccer player, but something that could be worn skiing or could be worn out. And so we've watched this progression over our 21-year history. And I feel like it's still in the process of happening.","Performance is certainly not dead. Performance is something that is actually a requirement. It's actually just expected, and it's almost given information now. And so where I believe some of the things that we saw in the fourth quarter, which is where we've had a base of a core basic business, is it's no longer just a few brands in sporting goods that are participating in this athletic inspiration. And so there's really a lot of competition coming from everywhere, but without question we believe that we're in the perfect position to continue to win.","We need to become more fashionable with the products that we have out there. And one of the things we found is that some of the core basics were some of the challenges that we saw, is that we are counting on core basics as we have in years past to do more work for us. But the consumer today frankly has more options, and frankly most of those options are from good brands that we compete with, that are heavily discounting as well.","So what you'll see is that I don't think it's one shift of abandoning one for the other. Obviously, with things like the investment we're making in UAS (31:30) in sport lifestyle in general, but we need to become more fashion. The consumer wants it all. They want product that looks great, that wears great, that you can wear at night with a pair of jeans, but that also does perform for them. But the performance has just become a bit of a given information. And so I think you'll see us continue to react to that, and hopefully I think you'll see us continue to lead in that. So our product must be at that point where it's not just a wearing occasion on field or for the quarter for the gym, it must be a wearing occasion that satisfies the consumer whether they're going out or they're going to school.","Omar Saad - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Good luck.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thank you, Omar.","Operator","Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Kevin, you've given a lot of detail today, and I appreciate that. Just curious to get your thoughts on how you gain comfort over the next few year period that North American market for apparel is not undergoing this just kind of deceleration from the furious pace that they have had growing (32:37) out over the past 5 to 10 years. In that you have the elements in place to go after where that next growth curve is really going to come from. There's obviously been a lot of near-term bumps in the road with the bankruptcies that have dislocated demand. So how do you expect to put the pieces together as you look out and make these investments that you need to make, to make sure that you're going after where that consumer is going ultimately?","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Yeah. So I think, without question, I want to start and I want to agree with the fact that what's happened at retailers, that retail is without question being disrupted. But we're not going to sit here and tell you and hang it on any one factor. The fact is as we look back on the fourth quarter, we believe that we own a large part of it. This is not something that we are just saying promotions and the consumer environment, all those things are very, very real, but we could have done a better job with our merchandising mix to be more proactive and more thoughtful about where they were going. But retail is being disrupted, and so whether it was what we saw in 2016 and frankly some of the indications we've seen with some of the filings going into 2017, so we need to be proactive with that and be thoughtful about that.","The fact of the matter though is that the consumer, they expect more today. They expect speed and convenience and best price and value, and they expect it the next day. So that choice of newness and customization is something that we need to react to and do a better job of. This idea though is we think that the cycle that we're living in from retail and inventing the next big thing, it's going to come from much closer to the concentric circle versus something built frankly off of a product that has to be hot, or an athlete or a celebrity, or a product that just happens to be about innovation.","And so as I was giving in the last answer, I think that the combination of those two things is going to be critical as we look forward. And one thing that I'll say as well of inventing the next big thing, I think that there's a lot of people, and this is nothing new, it's always been the case, of people that are trying to attain this world of being a lifestyle brand. But the fact is in order to be a lifestyle brand, you got to be grounded in something. And Under Armour is grounded in performance and so we're not looking to abandon one for the other. And I want to make sure I provide the color that as we look back and we reflect and we think and say, what can we do better, how do we get better, what's the projection looking out?","We've got a lot of great foundation to build on, and whether it is the growth that we've experienced, and frankly the growth that we still see in front of ourselves, it's continuing to define ourselves as a growth company. But, we want to make sure that we can control that based on the environment that we're seeing, based on some of the promotional activity that we're seeing, and make sure above all else we're always protecting the brand because this is a $5 billion \u2013 $5 billion-ish company that's focused on driving to $10 billion plus.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","And then just how you \u2013 you talked about leaning on footwear and international and DTC, and actually that's where the growth opportunities lie. Does this force you, or does this make you want to speed up the international penetration? You clearly have an opportunity in China that's in the early stages, if that, I think it's less than $200 million business for you. So does this make you want to lean on expanding the brand faster as you are going to reset the North American market and your position in it?","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Let me let Dave start with that. Go ahead, Dave.","David Bergman - Under Armour, Inc.","Yeah, Camilo, international is an area that we've definitely been investing in and doubling down on, and it's really, really been paying off for us. We've seen over 60% growth over the last three years. From a percentage of business, we've gone from 9% of our revs in 2014 up to 15% of our revs in 2016, and we're planning it to potentially exceed 20% of our revenue in 2017. Should actually cross $1 billion in 2017. So it's been a great area for us. We feel particularly strong on China, very bullish on that market. It's been one of our highest growth and becoming very, very profitable for us. A lot of great, great relationships that we're building in that market with great leadership. Europe as well. We've had some great strides there also, making some good traction with the right marketing investments there.","And then Latin America, which is kind of our newest region, is one that we're still cultivating, but it's growing well. And if you look at our total international profitability, year-over-year we're seeing significant improvement there. So it's a great play for us, and we're going to continue pushing hard in that area.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","And the global market, Camilo, it's very hungry for the Under Armour brand. This is one of the places where we must be measured, and I think we want to be thoughtful instead of just opening doors. We've seen this trap. You're seeing it play out a little bit here in North America. So, I think one of the benefits we have as a company with just under 300 company-owned stores and a little less than 600 total stores that we have with our partner doors, et cetera, around the world, that's a very different profile than the other two major players in our space.","And so, I don't know if anyone can invest heavily enough in digital right now and what that footprint's going to look like. But I've got a feeling that the moment and the point where the consumer decides to transact for any brand is going to continue to shift. And we feel very good about frankly the lack of commitment that we have with leases and other things and the ability for us to draw and frankly, paint the picture of what the retail consumer brand of the future is supposed to look like.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin. Best of luck.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thank you, Camilo.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti of UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks, Kevin, for all the outlook on the longer term. The comments are helpful there. It sounds like you still feel pretty good about the wide space opportunity, and it doesn't seem like you guys are isolated in your thoughts on the North American wholesale market. But if we could just maybe look at the gross margins again in 2017, I would've thought that \u2013 maybe I'm wrong here, but I would've thought that that would largely be down next year due to more markdowns. And then your guidance and inventory seems to sound like it will be improving through the year relative to the rate of revenue growth. What do you think is the realistic near term recapture rate for the gross margin after 2017 after some inventory clearing?","David Bergman - Under Armour, Inc.","Yeah. Michael, this is Dave. Gross margin in 2017, we're definitely going to continue to move forward on product cost improvements, and our internal margin from that will continue to improve. We should see a little bit less pressure from the promotional environment, especially in the back half of the year, but we'll still see a lot of pressure from that in the front half of the year.","In our DTC, expansion is also going to be a little bit of a lift to gross margin, but against that, as we continue to mention, is the footwear growth and the international growth. Those have meaningful differences in our gross margin versus our apparel and our North America business. So as those continue to outpace, those are going to be big pressures that we continue to face over the next few years. And right now, foreign currency is also little bit of a challenge for us. Not as big as maybe some others with our percentage of international, but it's still definitely something that we're dealing with.","So, in 2017, we're doing a lot of the great things, but we're still going to expect to see gross margin a little bit down and then probably more in the near term seeing that flatten out a little bit. But there's definitely opportunities longer term, and we've got a lot of people focusing on the right areas there, so we're looking for that in the longer term.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","And if I could just ask you about revenues in 2017, it sounds like a lot of the \u2013 so maybe there's some inventory in the marketplace, and you gave some helpful comments on mid-single digit rev growth in the first quarter. But if I look out beyond that a little bit, does the second half start to look more like the revenue growth rate that we were looking at 90 days ago? Do we start approaching 20% again in the back half just so that we can think about what's causing you guys to push pause on the revenue growth guidance for the front half of the year? And then the shape of our models as we look out a little bit?","David Bergman - Under Armour, Inc.","Yeah, Michael. We're not ready at this point to give quarterly revenue guidance, but Q1, we did give our guidance out. We're going to continue to look at the back half of the year. I think there are more opportunities in the back half of the year than the front half of the year, but we're going to avoid giving guidance by quarter at this point.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate the help. Thanks, guys.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I just had two questions. When you look at the outlook for the women's business, can you just update us on your thoughts on the opportunities there and the magnitude there? And the second question is, in a tougher top line environment for the company, how committed do you guys remain to the Connected Fitness investments that are ongoing?","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Yeah. So let me start with women's is that, again, we're really proud that women's hit that $1 billion mark for us, which is I think important on many levels. We look at the way in which we hit it though, and we still, even in our women's business approach it from a very much performance-based brand. We think there's a tremendous opportunity and the broader investment the company is making around things like lifestyle, are really going to pay dividends for us there. We remain incredibly bullish on women's, and this is led by leadership. Our shift to category management as well gives us and puts us in a position I think to be more focused on what we're doing.","And just to give you some perspective on how we're building out rounding our women's team, one of the analogies that I used in the last call was that even something as much progress as we made in our women's footwear, we've got six people on our women's footwear team comparatively to the competition that probably has dozens or hundreds in the same type of category. We've been able to double our women's styles. We've got a couple of franchise products that also share between men and women. And we think that we couldn't be more confident, but it's one of these things that continues to take time. And so that's distribution, that's placement. But we've got to deliver. We've got to do a great job in women's with the right merchandising assortment on the floor just as we do for men's.","As far as our commitments, the one thing that we said on one of the other questions was about our ability to force rank, our ability to make tough decisions. As a company, I think that's one of the things that's led to our strength. The first advice we'd ever give to a new entrepreneur is the key to any business is focus. And so I think we've always had that, beginning with the simple mantra of don't forget to sell shirts and shoes.","We know what we do for our livelihoods, and frankly the reason that we got into Connected Fitness to begin with, with an investment like that, was to help us sell more shirts and shoes. And so we still believe in that vision. We still continue to see it coming through. We have a major go-live this year with SAP, with our version of single view of the consumer. And we think that the amount of data that the 200 million users we have, telling us how much they exercise, what they ate and giving us data that will help us learn more about them to ultimately help us sell more shirts and shoes is something important.","At the same time, it doesn't mean that we're not going to be prudent across organization. We'll make sure that we're making and we're tightening the belt. But at this time, I think we feel really good about the leadership we have with Connected Fitness. We'll continue to of course forge on and build something bigger and better there.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Komp of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Kevin, just wanted to ask maybe a bigger-picture question framing up this year. If you think about maybe sitting at this place in this time next year, a year from now, do you think the business will be back on track to somewhere closer towards the long-term growth targets? Or maybe what factors do you think would prevent or keep you from getting back to those types of growth rates?","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","I think that, first and foremost, we talk about getting back. I think we've done a good job of changing the expectation of the way that people think about growth. In our sector still, even at the latest outlook where we said we're not going to look beyond the end of 2017, we're still talking about 12% growth with a business that will be 80%-ish here in North America. So we've got a tremendous amount of growth. We've got managing a tremendous amount of growth. And part of the human side of this too is going from a small business, to a medium business, to becoming a large business. We've been living and we've been dealing with that.","As I look out 12 months, I want to tell you first and foremost that I'm focused on the day-to-day. I'm focus on today and tomorrow. We feel very good about our outlook of where we're going. But, yeah, this isn't saying that Under Armour will never do 20% again. I mean you'll see 20% growth from this company. But we want to be measured, and we want to be thoughtful, and the last thing I ever want to do is try to chase that number.","And so a lot of our revenue outlook that we provided to you today was based on hopefully the explanation of a mature management team with a very young company. And I think that's us being prudent about the places where we do want to make sure that we're keeping our retailers, keeping our floors clean, making sure that we're not defined by basic product that needs to simply compete on price. Our product competes on innovation. Our product competes on newness and freshness.","And so, when we see those market dynamics changing, we don't like that game. And so the fact is, is that unfortunately we are pretty unbalanced when you look at our global mix. But that's quickly changing for us. When you look at our mix of apparel to footwear, that's changing for us. And we do continue to see these opportunities beginning with the top line, but this is not a top-line story exclusively, like we understand the value of the bottom line and we're asking investors and telling them that this is our money, we are using your money. Our interests are aligned.","And when we look and say everything from the top line to the operating income, we believe there's acceleration there. We believe that there's a short term where our job is we get paid to see around corners, and I believe we saw these things happening, and whether it's the move to footwear or lifestyle or international, some of them just haven't kicked in as fast as we wanted to, and the shifting dynamics out there in the marketplace has created a different situation than when we talked about even 18 months ago.","And so this is where I think we've built a lot of equity. We've built a lot of equity, and things like 26 quarters are the things we're incredibly proud of, but I don't think they define us either. And sometimes you look and you say, we do have a strong management team, we do have a firm vision of the company that we are going to be, it's going to take us, of course, doing the things we've always done, managing our business, running and keeping a tight belt. But we think that there are of course opportunity for us to continue to expand and explode beyond even what we're talking about through 2017.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you for that. And then maybe just following up more shorter term. I know Dave talked about on the cost side having some areas to pull back in the short run. What about on the sales side? Do you have any kind of shorter-term tactics or levers you can pull? I know the first quarter only expected up mid-single digits for revenue, but could you talk about tactically some of the things you're working on in the shorter term?","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Well, I think we're reviewing really what happened in the fourth quarter and first quarter together. And so as we think about it, is how do we ensure that we've got a healthy distribution channel? And 60% of our business is U.S. wholesale distribution. And so we've got to be thoughtful there about the way that we approach the marketplace. But from a leverage standpoint, that begins with innovation. We've got two new franchise products we'll be launching this spring as well with our Banded 3 (48:48) and our Gemini 3 both coming out, running shoes above $100, something we couldn't make that claim even 18 months ago.","We've got innovation from our new Threadborne initiative to Siro. So I think it all begins from a product standpoint, or a product perspective, and we feel really good about what we've got in the pipeline. But we want to be measured. I think right now as we're coming through this and as we thought about what's the best way to communicate, and I want to be clear. We understand the amount of information that we are giving the Street right now. And we've got that again, that 11-year track record that we speak to and say we're not happy about it. And I want you to know, we're not happy about the results that we're telling you right now. And we expect to continue to deliver as we always have.","And so 2017 will be no different. And so we've laid out some marks of what we can do, and where we believe that we can continue to meet and beat expectations. And looking at the year through a very healthy lens. So, I'd answer you in sum that with yes, great innovation. Those will be the accelerants to our growth.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, and good luck.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt McClintock of Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Yeah. Good morning. Kevin, I wanted to focus on DTC for a second because there is a lot of disruption in the U.S. environment specifically, and you talked about one of the lessons learned was speed. Or at least I believe you brought that up, speed. As you think about the need for increased speed and you think about the holes that may be \u2013 that are now presented from some of the disruption in the U.S., I mean does that make you want to accelerate the growth of DTC as a channel specifically?","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Well, number one. As DTC relates to e-commerce, I don't know if anyone can imagine that they can put enough money toward their digital businesses today. As I answered that earlier question about Connected Fitness, that is an investment in our digital business, in our own direct-to-consumer and e-commerce. And so we feel very bullish, and we feel like (50:56) really unique positioning unlike anyone else in our industry. And frankly I can't think of any companies that have sort of that amount of data flow to understand their consumer better. But as we think about the experiences first and foremost, it's about having a great consumer experience.","It's about when people show up, exciting them and helping them choose to transact, and doing it in a way which either; a, forces them to get up and go to brick and mortar; or b, it help them choose to transact on a phone. And so when I describe our DTC business, I think about e-commerce, full price, and outlet. And probably as recently as a year to two years ago, I'd probably give those in full price, out, and then e-commerce.","And so that world is here, and it's here to stay. And this is not to say that we think that retail is dead either. So we do believe that the move for us of being able to control our destiny. And we talk about upside. Our direct-to-consumer channel last year in the fourth quarter was up 23%, and it was up 27% for the full year. So we're still seeing great momentum there, and DTC represented close to 40% of our total business in the fourth quarter as well.","Controlling our own destiny is something which is, we like to do, but the fact is there are really good partners. But one of the shakeups that we're seeing happen at retail right now is that some are going to win and someone are not going to win. And so we want to make sure that we're getting behind and placing our bets on those great retail partners that are creating incredible dynamic retail experiences. And we have an obligation to them too to make sure that we have great dynamic product that sits on the floor, and will allow them to sell through at great turn and full price and full margin.","So, I don't think any of these things \u2013 I think the way that we're viewing it is, of course, we like controlling our destiny, but we began as a wholesaler, and we'll always have a wholesale aspect to our business with the best partners out there that continue to prioritize us and put us and present us in a way which we think tells and helps explain the great products that we have and doesn't just differentiate us by price.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks a lot, Kevin.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kernan of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","John Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Hey, John.","John Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC","Two questions. Can you just talk about what your assumptions are for apparel and footwear as we go through 2017? And what categories are going to really drive you? What type of growth in those categories is going to drive towards that $10 billion target?","David Bergman - Under Armour, Inc.","Hey, John, this is Dave. When you look at apparel and footwear, they're both going to be growing clearly for us. Footwear will definitely continue to outpace apparel to a pretty good degree. When you think about it throughout the year, the footwear growth will be a little bit less in Q1 for us than full year. We're comping a pretty high 64% Q1 2016 growth rate in footwear. And the majority of that growth in North America is going to come from new distribution in DTC. International growth is going to be a little bit more weighted to footwear than the North America growth, but again, footwear is definitely going to be overdriving apparel.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","And I'd like to add is that as we think about apparel and footwear, one of the big themes that I want to make sure we get across in this call and your communication is understanding that our commitment to editing. The ability to drive higher revenue is not about making more stuff, it's about having less stuff that's more curated with a stronger point of view.","What brands are required to do is provide two things: personality and point of view. And I think it's one thing you've always been able to count on from us. We see that happening. We see that growing, and it's one of the things that led to the 50% growth that we saw in footwear in 2016. But we know it's not entitled to us either which is one thing that says, we want to make sure we only have the best products and editing that line to the best pieces is what matters.","And so there's lessons to be learned as we look back on the successes and we look back on some of the misses that we had, but net-net, we're a better, stronger company. And when we look at things like footwear of not only being able to drive scale and saying, are we making a shoe that a consumer wants to buy? But being able to drive leverage with our manufacturing partners and things of \u2013 this year for the first time we'll make more than 50 million pairs of shoes. And that's something that helps us in that longer supply chain and ultimately help us with things like gross margin.","And so we're not talking about footwear being a materially smaller gross margin than what we're doing in apparel. And so, all these things I think are part of the natural process and progression of a company. I wish I could've read a book on it, but I think we're living it real time right now and we're giving you the best information we can. And you should know that you've got a management team and a commitment that we're going to run like hell for our shareholders.","John Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC","Just one final question for me. CapEx this year around 7% of sales, a lot of investments in growth and working capital. There's quite a bit of cash burn. The debt is growing on the balance sheet. Given the investments that likely need to go into digital and DTC, where do you think CapEx should trend over the next few years?","David Bergman - Under Armour, Inc.","Yeah, John. This is Dave again. CapEx is an area that we're really, really digging in deep on. We're challenging every CapEx dollar spent to make sure it really aligns with our longer term strategy. So as we look through that, there's some areas that we're going to be a little bit smarter about. North America Brand House builds in 2017 \u2013 we're not going to do as many as we've done in 2016. We're going to be a little careful in that retail environment.","Also, being more prudent about the different areas that we have a footprint in. Looking at our office space, looking at our real estate, looking at our distribution centers, and really trying to make sure that we can stretch out those spaces as long as possible and being really, really prudent about when we need to expand and take on more space.","So we're looking across the board from that perspective. This year, we are targeting a $400 million CapEx number. We don't see that massively increasing in the next year or two. We're going to continue to try and manage and prioritize those spend areas with a big focus on protecting the areas of long-term growth.","John Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I was just curious, kind of a follow-up question on international. When you guys look at the international business, whether it's Europe or China, some of the stuff you talked about for North America, I think you mentioned core basics not coming through as you guys were expecting, the need for more fashion, et cetera, and also the promotional environment going on over here. Can you give us some color on how much those things are playing out in both Europe and China right now?","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're having \u2013 we're seeing a very different picture. I want to make sure that I underscore for the group that listens, is that this is a great American brand. And it's in the process of becoming a great global company. And the demand that we're seeing from outside the United States was 63% growth for the year, consistent in building off the 59% \u2013 69% growth that we saw in 2015. It is something that is very real and very happening. And managing and curating and taking care of that brand is something important.","And, yeah, there is a great sense. And I don't know if I'd say it's greater than what we're seeing in America, but in categories that you've heard where we fought, and looked like in China our Curry product has done incredibly well and blown through our plans and our expectation. And that's because of probably two former tours that we did with the reigning MVP, the two-time reigning MVP, but we'll continue to do that.","I think at the same time, Robbie, is we want to stay measured. Is that we've got a great leader in our Head of Revenue, Charlie Maurath, who joins us from 20-plus years in the industry, and knows the global markets better than anyone else. And so establishing that global footprint as we now sell in more than 60 countries, it's taken us a long time to do that and to become \u2013 get to scale.","And at the same time, as good as we're seeing the market and the reaction to UA in China, as good as we're seeing the reaction of now 13 years or 12 years having built in places like Europe, we're still seeing things like in Latin America that it's a bit challenged because of a market like Brazil. And that's one of the things when we look at the measurement, we look at OI, and we ask about prioritizing our investments, we believe in a market like Brazil. We just think it's going to take time, and this will be part of the cycles that as we become a broader, global company, that we'll be happy that we have the balance of region with Europe, and with Asia, and with Latin America, and with the United States. And so this is something that we believe.","I think North America, I think as I said earlier, I think that we're definitely going through a shift. I think it's one of the things that's playing out in many of our core distribution. But we're excited to bring on partners like what we're having with Kohl's. But frankly as you look at the total landscape, and you look at why isn't the revenue going up more, is that where Kohl's is and where Sports Authority was were basically a one-to-one wash from a revenue standpoint.","And so we're very pragmatic. I think we're very practical. I want you to know we're very sober. Our eyes are wide open, and we're making the best decisions that we can to drive this company forward focused on being a $10 billion brand. And so all these things hurt. I want you to know that we take it personally. And I want you to know that you've got a committed team here that is ready to run based off the track record of history and success that we put up in the past. We expect people to feel that more and more. And so we know how to win, and we expect to do a lot of it and a lot more of it.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. That's really helpful. Thanks, Kevin.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thanks, Robby.","Operator","That's all the time we have for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Kevin Plank for any closing remarks.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Yeah. I'd like to thank you all for your time and attention this morning. I'm extremely proud of what our team has accomplished in 2016. And as a brand, we've grown up very, very quickly. With quick growth comes lessons. And to be sure there were some valuable lessons in the fourth quarter, we learned lessons. Ones that we'll use to reduce future vulnerability, ones that we'll use to ignite and inspire even greater magnitude of hunger and humility throughout the organization, and ones that serve as a catalyst to transform the complex to the simple, to move faster, stronger and smarter across the board.","Someone asked me recently, and they said \u2013 they asked if this has been a humbling experience for me? And as we were looking and contemplating, preparing for the call, and one of our senior execs, and my reaction to them was, like all of us, I'd like to think that being humble or being made humble is never required. But who knows, we probably all get over our skis a little bit. At the same time, the way that I view this year is something that I think we can definitely look back on and say we've been made much wiser. And so I don't believe there are surprises in life. I believe that everything is something that we can hopefully forecast or see. But sometimes it's not so clear to us.","And so, again, I want to remind you that our eyes are wide open, and we are ready to run in 2017 and beyond. That's exactly what we're working on in 2017. And we're going to work on adding the next $5 billion to our company. Thank you all very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Following our prepared remarks we'll open the call to questions.","And with that I'd like to turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2017 is a year we're empowering Under Armour to become a single, more agile, stronger and smarter company. Our first quarter marks a good start to this journey.","In January we detailed some of the challenges we're facing in North America as well as what we feel are our competitive advantages to manage through this rapidly changing environment. We talked about the imbalance caused by extreme growth, due to more than doubling our size over the past three years. We spoke to the unique strength of our brand, unparalleled ability to connect with global athletes and our tremendous portfolio of growth drivers.","That said, our strategy is about more than this quarter or the next, and while parts of the broader environment remain uneven, we feel very good about the evolution of our brand strength, relationships with consumers around the world and our ability to gain share in key markets and categories.","Whether analyzing the next 3, 5 or 10 years by product type, gender, category, channel or geography, we are underpenetrated comparatively by any measure, market share, mind share and potential. So now, as the third-largest athletic brand in the world with more than $15 billion ahead of us to second place and another $15 billion ahead of that to first place, the fact remains that we have significant and scalable opportunities before us.","To build on commentary from our last call, the road to the first $5 billion was much different than we expect the road to the next $5 billion to be.","Yet we can't talk about results or opportunity without considering the need for balance. With a shifting terrain we are hyper-focused on balancing external marketplace growth with internal operational excellence, working both in concert to embolden the strength of our brand. By balancing investments and innovation, consumer connectivity and experiences with the appropriate operational discipline, we are on a long-term path to ensure more consistent returns to shareholders.","The core of our strategy, though, remains aspirational great product with a relentless pursuit of innovation and the creation of compelling experiences for our consumers. We have one of the most unique brand communities on the planet, a relationship we cherish and never take for granted, particularly our relationship with kids, the youth of this generation. We aspire to be a brand that is both trusted and desired. This consumer-led approach continues to take shape by the transformation toward Category Management.","That said, I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight how we're progressing against that goal. Eighteen months ago we made the decision to reset the company around key sport categories. This decision was driven by our extreme growth, changing consumer behavior and the immense opportunity to address the unmet needs of our consumers. From men's and women's training, running, basketball and global football to outdoor, team sports, youth and lifestyle sportswear, this evolution is well underway.","2016 and 2017 have a high focus on leveraging and empowering our team structurally. With our move into Category Management, we're working to enhance our product creation, supply chain and speed-to-market processes and functionally how we will bring products to market in the future via merchandising, demand creation and our overall distribution strategy.","By emphasizing a clear go-to-market capability, we'll take a better approach to driving the core basics that our business was built on while also emphasizing elevated product across all categories with innovation and experiences that inspires consumers. The purpose of this structure is to drive authenticity within each sport category, getting us as close as possible to the consumer as efficiently and effectively as possible.","So how's it working? So let's touch on a few highlights. I'm going to go ahead and start with our smallest category, yet potentially one of our largest long-term growth opportunities, our sportswear business. In only 24 months, we've gone from an idea to a fully dedicated team of product designers headquartered in New York City who have set up the backbone of this key growth driver, built on leadership.","There's two ways we're approaching this. First, with the launch of our UAS collection last fall and the second line this past quarter, we began to interpret and authenticate the Under Armour brand within fashion. This top-of-the-pyramid approach that is pinnacle, premium product, blends the intersection of our brand's core sport and performance elements with a unique personal style and creative expression. Understanding this is a longer-term strategic position, we are hitting the benchmarks we set for ourselves to make lifestyle a core competency of our brand and the halo impression that will have access across all categories that we do business in today.","Secondly, it's emphasizing lifestyle throughout our product line and influencing styles, silhouettes and distribution we already serve. One example is we've taken lessons from UAS' quick-to-market strategy to create the Unstoppable lifestyle collection which is due out later this year. This will represent our first complete better-level men's and women's sport fashion expression.","Turning to basketball, it's a global category that continues to post consistent growth as the brand gains more visibility, authenticity and performance around the world. Some of this hard work certainly paid off in the first quarter with 11 women's and 12 men's teams making the NCAA Tournament for Under Armour, which is a record for the company; and most exciting, our brand's first ever NCAA National Championship in basketball as the University of South Carolina women's team took home the title. And the men's team made South Carolina's and Under Armour's first Final Four.","Yet our success in basketball hasn't been without its learning. In spring 2015, we debuted our first signature basketball shoe with Stephen Curry, the Curry 1, who has since become a two-time NBA MVP and global icon. The limited launch of the Curry 1 was a strong success and set us up well to realize even greater growth with Curry 2, which included a much broader spectrum of distribution, color and launches.","Lockstep with other franchises like Drive, Lightning and Jet, our performance offering has continued to evolve nicely, mixing speed, support, balance and style with the NBA's run and gun position-less style of play.","As we launched the Curry 3 late last year, our expectations continued to run high. And while the Curry 3 plays very well on-court for Stephen Curry and our athletes, a sluggish signature market and a warm consumer reception has led to softer-than-expected results. This has created an inventory imbalance that we're working through, one that, yes, is baked into our full-year outlook, which hasn't changed, and most importantly, yielded lessons we're applying ahead with the Curry 4 and beyond.","Not only for the Curry 4 but moving forward, we have retooled our test, learn, scale approach in this business to be sharper, sharper with respect to the number of color offerings, scarcity, exclusive and cadence of launches to drive more consistent engagement and results. And sharper with our basketball portfolio composition to target balanced growth across all assortments to address players at all levels.","One of the highlights for UA is the strong grassroots systems that we've built across AAU and our high school teams, where athletes are competing and winning championships. We're incredibly proud of our basketball business and see tremendous runway ahead as we continue to take market and mind share with this key consumer.","Another area we remain incredibly bullish on is our overall women's business. We reached $1 billion in revenue in 2016, a huge milestone for our brand, and our confidence continues to build. And of course, it starts with great product. Our women's team has been working relentlessly, thinking differently to elevate style and performance as we continue to earn her trust and greater closet share beyond key core items.","A great example is the Misty Inspired collection that launched in the first quarter, designed purposely to elevate style, silhouettes and layering pieces that can be worn anywhere. We're seeing strong demand for the entire collection and have gained valuable insight into how we market this collection and engage her into our brand even more deeply.","Across our whole women's business, we're proud of the foundation we've laid but really feel we're just getting started, identifying her unique UA voice. As we continue to learn, engage and drive insights, we see an incredible amount of runway for this business. But there is work to be done.","In addition to success from moves toward Category Management, we've made progress against operational goals as well. This quarter marked the completion and go-live of our work with SAP to build what we call the single view of the consumer. This system combines global point-of-sale, e-commerce and transactional information with our Connected Fitness business. As we make the transition from data collection to data analytics and reporting, we are now equipped with real-time information on over 200 million users.","This empowers our teams to leverage our speed to create, drive and accelerate value for our consumers through new personalized products, services and experiences. So what used to take weeks or even months for us to get information on new product performance, trending workouts and demographics, now takes seconds with the speed and analytical horsepower provided by this incredible consumer insights engine.","Two first quarter examples of utilizing single view of the consumer include our Athlete Recovery Sleepwear, launched with Tom Brady, and the Project Rock collection, a collaboration with Dwayne Johnson. Two launches for us that drove incredible demand and that we are currently working to replenish, except where we are building scarcity.","Using UA's SVOC [single view of the consumer], we're able to instantaneously analyze consumer purchase behavior including gender, ages and workout frequency among other attributes. These insights will now be integrated in a next-gen product development, helping drive discussions around product planning, assortments, future marketing and ultimately a better and more premium experience for our consumers.","Next up, and only a few months out, is an upgrade of our entire enterprise resource planning system that we've been investing heavily in since 2015, specifically, SAP's FMS, or Fashion Management Solution. FMS will allow us to manage all of our processes across one data landscape with the ability to analyze large information volumes, ultimately ensuring greater operational efficiency, better inventory planning and greater speed to market.","This has been no easy effort, and I take great pride in calling out and thanking the hundreds of global teammates that have been working tirelessly, living, breathing, testing and retesting again and again to ensure that we're optimally aligned for this game-changing evolutionary step for Under Armour.","Once combined, Category Management, Connected Fitness and our SAP capabilities will become a powerful instrument to further address the rapidly changing consumer environment. From insight-driven product creation to purchase through end use, this data-fueled ecosystem creates one of the most powerful and unique consumer connections in our industry, a true two-way consumer-led conversation that will directly integrate and strategically influence our go-to-market strategy. This highly sophisticated engine represents a critical asset and competitive advantage as we work toward becoming a $10 billion business.","So what does Q1 tell us about Under Armour? It tells us that we're stable and staying healthy even as segments of our wholesale business in North America fight through uneven terrain. It tells us that we are actively managing our growth, that our inventory levels are appropriate, and that we have a strong innovation agenda. It demonstrates meaningful progress against our move toward Category Management, a structure strengthened by vital systems upgrades. And it confirms that we're in a good position to invest in growth opportunities, both short and long term, while driving to become even more efficient and effective across our business.","With a start to the year where we did what we said we would do, we're tracking well against our targets. As we look to the future, we will continue to make the best long-term decisions for our brand, teammates, communities, and of course our shareholders. And we're going to do it while adding more than $0.5 billion in revenue in 2017, implementing new SAP systems, standing up our Category Management structure and keeping an energized flow of exciting product and experiences coming for our consumers.","We know we've got hard work ahead of us, and while we are certainly used to that, we respect the challenge and are pursuing it full force. And that's what I'd leave you with. Our team is hungry and humble with our heads down, engaging, empowering, editing and executing.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave to take a deeper look at our results.","David Bergman - Under Armour, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin. We are pleased with our first quarter result which came in a little better than we expected due to some cadence and timing shifts, and we remain on track with our full-year outlook. So let's take a look at how we did.","Total revenue in the first quarter was up 7% to $1.1 billion. By product type, apparel revenue increased 7% to $715 million driven by strength in golf, team sports and training. By continuing to focus on improved assortments, newness and innovation, including premium apparel platforms like Threadborne and Athlete Recovery Sleepwear, we feel well-positioned to deliver a solid year.","In line with our expectations, revenue for our footwear business was up 2% to $270 million. Recall that we're lapping 64% growth in last year's first quarter which had significant strength in basketball sales. Some footwear standouts in the quarter included golf, women's training and running.","Additionally, we had less liquidation in the quarter as we're working to ensure appropriate-to-channel inventory and driving our premium position in the category. Hitting $1 billion in revenue in 2016 was a great accomplishment, and we expect another year of growth that outpaces the overall company.","Revenue for accessories increased 12% to $89 million in the quarter with solid results from men's training, youth and global football.","Looking at revenue by channel, our wholesale business was up 4% to $773 million, reflecting an uneven North American environment and the tough comp given the bankruptcies of several key partners in 2016.","Direct-to-consumer revenue grew 13% to $302 million, representing 27% of global revenue in the quarter. This growth was balanced across all three concepts, factory and brand houses and e-commerce.","Our licensing business grew 25% to $24 million in the first quarter driven by strength in our socks business and our licensed partner in Japan.","In addition, our Connected Fitness business was up 2% to $19 million.","On a regional basis, in line with our expectations, our North American business was down 1% to $871 million as the promotional environment we saw in the fourth quarter of last year carried into 2017. Accordingly, we continued to proactively manage our inventory while still protecting brand health with meaningfully less liquidation product in this year's mix as previously noted. Also important to note is that growth from new wholesale distribution in the quarter was not enough to offset the bankruptcies of 2016.","Our International business, which we define as everything outside the U.S. and Canada, continues to deliver strong top-line results, posting a 52% increase in revenue to reach $227 million, or 20% of total revenue in the quarter. Currency-neutral revenue was up 57%.","Looking down into geographies, EMEA revenues were up 55% to $103 million, driven by continued momentum in the UK and Germany with balanced strength across wholesale and DTC and increases in nearly every sport category.","Asia-Pacific revenues increased 60%, driven by strength in China and Australia as well as the first full quarter of contribution from South Korea which is now direct versus previously being through a license.","And finally, our Latin American business was up 30% with broad-based growth across distribution channels and categories.","Turning to margins, first quarter gross margin was down 70 basis points to 45.2% due to continued inventory management efforts, a regional mix that skewed heavier toward international and foreign currency impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by channel mix which included a lower mix of liquidations.","SG&A expenses increased 12% to $498 million driven by investments in our direct-to-consumer, international and footwear businesses. This increase was slightly better than planned due in part to some timing shifts including head count additions and demand creation expenses which have moved into future quarters based on execution needs.","First quarter operating income was $8 million. Interest expense in the quarter was up 73% to $8 million, and our tax rate in the first quarter approached 200% compared to 42% last year due to discrete items taken in certain foreign markets and the implementation of new accounting rules related to the tax treatment of equity compensation.","Combined, these were about $3.5 million with the biggest portion driven by discrete international items which are particularly impactful to our effective tax rate in periods such as the first quarter with lower consolidated pre-tax income levels.","Taking all this to the bottom-line, we had a net loss of $2 million in the first quarter or a $0.01 loss of diluted earnings per share compared to a $0.04 gain in the prior year.","Now turning to our balance sheet; cash and cash equivalents was up 10% to $172 million. Inventory was up 8% to $902 million while we focused on efforts to manage product flow with demand to ensure brand and channel health. Total debt was down 8% to $861 million. And finally, CapEx was down 28% to $65 million, demonstrating our disciplined approach to infrastructure investments.","With respect to our full-year 2017 outlook, there are no changes from the prior targets we gave on January 31st which were included in our press release this morning.","Next, I want to provide some color on the balance of the year. As we look to transition our new SAP platform early in the third quarter, we are proactively taking measures to ensure as little disruption as possible to our business operations and delivery of customer orders.","With some potential movement depending on how SAP timing flows through, we expect the revenue growth rate in the second quarter to be approximately 1 point higher than the first quarter. And in the second half of the year, we expect revenue to be up at a mid-teen percentage rate with by far the strongest comparison of 2017 being in the fourth quarter.","We expect first half gross margin to be down approximately 120 basis points due to the impact of changes in foreign currency, efforts to manage inventory and higher airfreight expense which more than offset the benefit to channel mix.","In line with revenue expectations, gross margin should also see its strongest comp in the fourth quarter of this year.","Turning to SG&A, the previously mentioned timing shifts of marketing and other expenses into future quarters combined with ongoing investments in our DTC, international and footwear businesses are expected to result in an operating loss of approximately $15 million to $20 million in the first half of 2017.","And finally, we expect a mid-teen effective tax rate in the second quarter due again to discrete international items.","To close, I've been with Under Armour for 12 years, and I've seen a constantly changing map versus terrain and have the greatest confidence in the team we have in place to meet these opportunities as we continue to position ourselves for the future. We are focused on financial and operational discipline that drives efficiency across the organization. We are working collaboratively to determine the balance between growth, share and scale and the right return on investment necessary to deliver consistent and profitable long-term growth.","We've already begun to identify specific opportunities to reduce complexity and drive towards a leaner, more responsive organization, and we look forward to sharing more details later this year.","With that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Morning.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I guess the two questions that I have for you this morning, the first one is on the footwear with the 2% number this quarter, what have you learned (23:27) the optimism that you have going forward for a rebound in footwear? And the second question is you gave some detail on the expectation for the revenues to reaccelerate throughout the remainder of the year, especially the back half. Can you just discuss a little bit more the confidence that you have in that forecast as well?","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Hey, Bob. So number one, let me just begin with, as it regards to footwear is that we don't like it and we don't accept it. We believe in footwear and we believe what we've built in the infrastructure that's now in place.","And our footwear for the year is actually going to outpace the overall growth of the company for 2017, so we realize the base that we've put in place going back to 2016, crossing $1 billion and that's given us scale and it's given us the ability to invest.","So the infrastructure that we have from the global innovations (24:18) over the last 11 years we've been building locally where we (24:22) it all comes together at the Under Armour Lighthouse, as well as the new footwear building that we're putting up in Portland where our team can have a house that they can actually call a home.","So we understand that as we look at what's happening in the marketplace, number one, we're a performance brand, and we continue to see momentum in some of our on-field and on-court categories, things like cleated and things like running as well as what we're seeing in basketball. There's other momentum that we have in the marketplace, but we see and we understand the shift to lifestyle. The one thing we think is important though is that all the lifestyle that we'll introduce, whether it's apparel, whether it's footwear, are things that will build on the credibility we have because of our authentic athletic base.","But we've also seen some things in our lifestyle families like the 24\/7, our Encounter product, and a new product we just unveiled called Threadborne Shift a couple weeks ago.","It's also important to note that the international demand for our footwear is very, very strong right now. It's a competitive landscape here in the U.S., and that's nothing we shy away from. But we understand that we can win, and we are doing that and we're doing it at premium price points.","So there's three things to really focus on for footwear right now. And first and foremost, it always comes back to product; innovation and building great, great product. And I want to tell you that our pipeline is full, and we understand the need and the key for beautifully designed product that also raises our technical game.","We also have some technical game that we can bring into that through beautiful delivered product, things like our new connected shoe which we launched v2 of this year at CES, and there's more innovation coming in the future where we believe leveraging the business that we have at Connected Fitness, we think that there is a real product opportunity there, and we've seen some things that really give us encouragement.","We're also doing some things from the personalization standpoint like UA Icon, which is going to be launching later this summer, which is a customization capability for consumers to go on to ua.com and be able to build their favorite Under Armour footwear and customize it to anything that they'd like on the shoe.","So a couple programs we really think are going to be differentiators for us, but we understand that this comes from driving product first and foremost. And for us that means building franchise, and this is sort of an ethos for the company this year is that Under Armour is officially out of acquisition mode and we're into activation mode.","We have franchises in footwear, things like Bandit and Gemini, Slingflex, Highlight, Curry and many more in the pipeline which has proven that we can sell product above $100, and that's a unique thing for any brand. So as we sit here as the third-largest brand in the world and we think about the competition we have in front as well as that are behind us, we understand that that's the key. With running styles approaching nearly 20 running styles above $100, we need to make sure that they all sell through, and that happens.","We also have to focus on, just thirdly, is our expanding access to consumers, and we're fortunate to be in that position that we have the distribution lever to be able to utilize this year, because that is what helps give us the critical volume to compete with the two companies in front of us versus worrying about the multiple companies behind us.","And again just to remind you, when we say expanding distribution, we are not going to any new distribution other than what's been commented on out there. We said a couple years ago that we had 11,000 points of distribution; we were targeting 13,000 points of distribution. We feel good about where we are right now. And we feel that this is going to give us a distribution lever that allows us to continue to push the critical volume so that we can continue to build product at the premium end of our business as well.","So Under Armour is focused on $100-plus footwear, and we feel like we're making great strides to get there. And I just want to reiterate again is that we do see the growth for the full year outpacing the overall company growth too.","David Bergman - Under Armour, Inc.","And, Bob, this is Dave. I'll jump in on the second part of your question relative to back half and Q4. Q4 and back half confidence comes really from product distribution and also pricing strategy. From a product perspective we have new offerings such as our Unstoppable lifestyle product. We have new running technology. We also have a lot of confidence in Reactor products, just as a few examples.","And also we learned a lot from last fall\/winter, and so we broadened our fall\/winter assortment with more layers such as lightweight fleece to be better prepared for any type of winter. We've revisited our auto-replenishment program. We also have more price and distribution levers that we're pulling, as Kevin mentioned, along with a better strategy to refresh our product on the floor more quickly.","So and you add it all up, we also have a smaller comp in Q4. And we're just definitely excited about what we can deliver in the back half and Q4 altogether.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane of Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Hey.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","My first question is just on the North America market. I think there has been evidence of a high level of promotions in this market. How are you feeling about North America over the next few quarters from a promotional standpoint? And do you think we can return to inflation and price increases after a prolonged period of promotion?","David Bergman - Under Armour, Inc.","So, Kate, this is Dave. I'll start off with that one. North America being down 1%, simply put, we don't like it, and we don't really accept it. It was in line with our expectations, though. We expected the choppy promotional environment would carry over from Q4. We did anticipate that our new distribution wasn't going to be enough to offset the prior-year bankruptcies. But we are proactively managing our inventory and brand health in the marketplace. And that also included less liquidation this quarter.","So in general we did expect the lower growth in Q1 for North America. But it's not something that we're going to accept.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Kate, let me start underscoring that from David. But more importantly, like the promotional environment that exists out there, it's pervasive, it's something that's very real, and it's something that we need to be prepared for. And I think I feel really good about it.","In the back half of 2016 it's something that we knew we could have done a better job with, and it's the lessons learned that we are applying going forward. So that being said, it's just understanding the way that we've approached 2017. Because when we look at growth overall for our company, it's been a heck of a three years of going and doubling the business over that period of time and has us looking forward about what's next.","And so we really are focused this year on operational excellence and what we can do to being a better run company. And again we're going to do that while still adding more than $0.5 billion in revenue.","So we're definitely not going to stand still, and we certainly don't like going backwards. And so focusing on going forward is where we are. We have a lot of executional opportunities in the near term and also while building I think the bigger, better engine for the future. And as we do that I think there is a couple ways that we're looking to make that happen.","I mentioned in my script three real focuses we have at the company. First is structure, I think of having just the alignment of evolving from a small company to a mid-company to getting to a bigger-size business. Category management we believe is going to be a big difference of keeping us close to the consumer as well as giving P&L responsibility in a matrix approach that allows and drives real accountability for us.","Secondly, but probably it's the most important \u2013 it's absolutely the most important \u2013 is just great product, reinventing our core basics. That's one thing that I wanted people to know is it that is where my focus has been. As we have seen and looked at sort of where we are right now, when we made the calibration of saying 2017 for us is a year that we're going to change the growth outlook, it's so we have the ability to make the best decisions for our business.","And making sure that there's three ways we want to look to do that is reinventing our core basics, which means being productive. Is that we lived on a legacy business for a long time where our product would just sell. And we had these big T&M (32:05) volumes.","But now when you hear me emphasis the idea of go-to-market strategy, I think we're really being clear and deliberate about the products that we have in the marketplace with each and every product not just selling because it's heritage, but selling it because it's the best product out there. And I feel like we've addressed that and particularly in the back half of this year.","It also means getting behind some of the planned programs we had for energy and excitement this year, things like Project Rock and our new sleepwear line. And then also \u2013 I touched on this, but the new product that we're bringing to market. And listen, we get it. We understand what lifestyle is about, and we have a new product line called Unstoppable that will be hitting in toward the end of Q3 and into Q4 of this year too.","So we're chasing the opportunities, and I think probably more importantly a better way to say it is we're attacking those opportunities.","And third and finally is that we're editing. The reliance that we've had on that key item volume is something where we can't just put items into the marketplace and expect them to sell. The consumer expects more. But more importantly, our shift to lifestyle isn't about a new line or one collection or one drop. It's about truly evolving the entire company toward the space. And so you'll see that reflected \u2013 and this is nothing new. We've been in the lifestyle business for over two years, building it out, starting at the premium and evolving that throughout our product line.","As far as it goes with the promotional environment, that's the reality of where we are today. We don't feel like we control that. We feel like people are making decisions from all different angles, which are going to impact what's happening in the broader base.","So I think one thing that I just want to sort of underscore as you think about North America \u2013 maybe this is just a broader statement on where the (33:48). Under Armour is a performance company and we don't want to shy away from that. We know our foundation, but we also know that that foundation is what gives us the credibility because there is a lot of people that have now jumped into the athletic space in some way, shape or form. But as companies endured and as brands endures, Under Armour is a great brand and we expect to endure through this. And so we're going to play offense this year, but we'll be prepared for whatever the market brings us. And we feel pretty good about that.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Kevin, if I could just follow up with one quick question that I think rolls into what you were saying, could you comment all about how you're thinking about segmentation, especially now that you're in Kohl's? And how you're feeling about the differentiation of product between what you're selling there in the mid tier versus your premium end customers?","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Yes. So as I mentioned a minute ago, we told you a while back that we had about 11,000 points of distribution, we were targeting roughly 13,000. So we've now hit that. As far as distribution goes, number one, it was important to me that when we announced expanded distribution that it was the same day that we announced being on Fifth Avenue and committing to building the greatest retail store in the world that will open in the middle of 2019.","So our commitment to being premium brand has never wavered or changed, but to compete at the levels where we want to run, we feel that we need to be the best and we feel like we need coverage and coverage is about some of the volumes that we can drive.","And again, where we talk about being in 13,000 points of distribution, it's important to remind people that some of our key competition has more than 23,000 points of contribution in North America alone.","So apples to apples, we feel very good about where we are. Now, that does lead to the question of segmentation strategy, which we told you, the beginning of 2016 was the first time that we really stood up merchandising for ourselves as a brand, and with that comes having clear segmentation between our product lines.","So I think that we're good today, but we understand what our customers want. And they want differentiation. And they expect it and they demand it. And frankly, that we have a brand that has the capability of doing it, and things like some of the investments we're making between systems and between some of the structural things in Category Management \u2013 we feel pretty good about our ability to do that.","As far as additional distribution or anything there goes, we are completely, as I said, out of acquisition mode and in activation mode. The goal that we have is making all of our existing partners better, and this means doing a better job in the stores where we are. So you're not going to hear of any additional big box opening happening in the United States for a very long period of time. We like the team that we have on the court. We like our distribution, and we think that we have a great, great opportunity there.","As far as our relationship, the kickoff and launch that we've had at Kohl's has exceeded our expectations to date, and they have been a very good partner. That being said, I want to reiterate that we have some amazing partners right now as well, and our goal that we have as a company is focusing that we don't have to \u2013 I don't believe we have to open any new distribution.","I don't think that we need new categories. I don't think that the platforms that we unveiled as a company \u2013 doesn't mean we won't have any new ones, but I'm really giving my team the ability to just relax and just focus on what we have right now and becoming excellent in every category, every sports marketing asset and the pieces we have and using 2017 as a year to get better at doing that.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt McClintock of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Kevin, the comment was made just a second ago that you're proactively managing the brand health, and I thought it would be helpful if maybe high level we could just get your assessment of where the brand health stands today overall? And then as a follow-up, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the innovation? You talked a lot about lifestyle and there has been a lot of discussion about that. But what changes to the innovation pipeline are you making? And maybe can you provide some visibility into innovation on the horizon in 2017 and maybe beyond? Thank you.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Matt. So first of all, financially we did exactly what we said we're going to do this quarter, so I think anything as it relates to brand health from that standpoint is that we had a pretty good idea of where we were.","As far as our brand goes, and this is somebody with 21 years having been in this industry, I truthfully wouldn't change positions with anyone else in the world, with any other brand. I believe that our brand is positioned, I believe that our brand is strong, I believe that our brand demonstrates that we can take punches and I believe that our brand also demonstrates that it can throw them, too.","So you look at the bevy of assets that we've built and the things that we have as a company today. We've got international business that's growing more than 50%, which remains one of our largest opportunities as a company. As far as the base of partnerships we have here in the U.S., we've got more than 40 all-school collegiate deals where we outfit them head to toe. We're introducing ourselves to the State of California this year with the introduction of signings of Cal Berkeley and UCLA. We've added a new outfitting deal with Major League Baseball that goes through 2030 and declaring to build the greatest retail store in the world on Fifth Avenue that opens in 2019.","This brand is looking forward, and we expect to bring our consumers with us. And if you are starting a brand today or looking at who we had and the support that we had, I think a lot of these things have been misstated in terms of where and how people are aligned with our company \u2013 Tom Brady; Dwayne The Rock Johnson; Stephen Curry; Lindsey Vonn; Misty Copeland; Jordan Spieth; Anthony Joshua who will be fighting for the Heavyweight Championship of the World this weekend; as well as some that you've never heard of, like a boxer from Baltimore named Gervonta.","There is more people buying Under Armour this year than they did last year. We're adding and standing up new systems, our Category Management structure, an energized flow of exciting new product experiences for our consumers, and we're also adding $0.5 billion in revenue this year.","So I can't tell you exactly how other people feel, but I know how our athletes, our team, our partners, and I know how I feel about the future of the company. So I think we definitely have work to do, but I think the strength of the brand is something that's been built over the last 21 years. And I think as people continue to learn and hear our story, and as you start to hear our marketing and our voice tuned up throughout the balance of this year and amplified, we feel pretty good about where that would be.","On innovation, if you want me to keep riffing, I can give you sort of where we are and how we see it from a product standpoint is that anything that begins with brand health just comes back to product. It's where we've been focused. It's where we are right now.","So let me give you sort of innovation as we're seeing it in three buckets. The first would be apparel. So a big part of our marketing push this year has been around the platform of Threadborne. The Threadborne, it's not going away, and it's something we're going to continue to lean on. It is a ridiculously soft and beautiful performance fabric that fits into a number of different platforms for us and something that goes from apparel all the way through to footwear.","You're also going to hear about something called Reactor, which is an exclusive down insulation that allows your body to heat up, cool down depending on what's happening from external temperature side.","On the footwear side, I mentioned the connected shoe before, which is something that's pretty \u2013 we believe in that market, and we think there's a story. We think we're the ones to tell the story because we don't think it's been told yet, and that's on the come.","And then we also \u2013 I think we've got lifestyle and things like Slingflex, it's done well for $100. A product, again, I mentioned the Threadborne Shift.","And then it's also innovating around our core. Again, we've got this consumer, with the youth of this country, we believe we have great positioning with things like the Highlight cleat. We're looking forward to the Curry 4 and building those franchises.","And the third thing I'd say from a innovation standpoint \u2013 and this may not be innovation to others, but for us it's something that's a key growth driver of where we're going \u2013 is just the addition of lifestyle. Lifestyle and what makes us unique when we talk about innovation is ours won't just be product that just looks better. Everything does something. It will all fit the Under Armour DNA of being better, being best in class.","And so you'll see that happen through \u2013 I mentioned Unstoppable, the Inspired collection by Misty. We've got The Rock, more launches dropping, Supervent, a few surprises in store as well. So our differentiation we believe is something that's significant and we think that our credibility as an authentic athletic brand is something that gives us the right to be here and play here. And frankly, there will be few standing as all these different trends comes and go.","Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great color, Kevin. Thank you.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti of UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. I know it's a tough macro out there, guys. Just a quick modeling question and then maybe just a higher level question for Kevin. Can you talk to us a little bit more about the puts and takes on the gross margin as we head into the second quarter? It looks like the first half guide implies 2Q will be down about 180 basis points, obviously worse than the first quarter, but as compares get easier I would think the currency pointed out would start to diminish. Inventories look like they're in better shape. It seems like you took some pain in the first quarter there to clean it up. I know you said something about airfreight being a bit more of a headwind in 2Q, but maybe just give us a little bit more on the second quarter and what some of the headwinds are, get to a more significant 2Q compare versus 1Q?","David Bergman - Under Armour, Inc.","Hey, Michael. This is Dave. I'll take that one. When you think about Q2 gross margin, some of the inventory management promotional environment challenges we had in Q1 we're still expecting to persist into Q2. We also did mention that we're going to have a little bit higher airfreight. Some of that has to do with managing around our SAP go live.","We do expect some continued headwinds from the FX impacts, but also our international business is actually growing a little bit faster than we even planned even though we were excited about it to begin with. And as you know, that creates a little bit of a margin headwind also.","So when you add all of those up, it does make Q2's margin a little bit tougher, but then as you trend back into the back half of the year, we do expect and are planning on a little bit more of improved product costing benefits in the back half which we're excited to see. You will have less year-over-year impacts of promotions and discounts when you're comping that. And also we're expecting a beneficial mix of product, or actually with channel, when you think about DTC being up more and then also the fact that we've talked about liquidation being a smaller mix of our business.","So we've got some bigger favorability in the back half which should be able to for the most part offset the continued pressure on FX headwinds along with the footwear and international pressures that we always have with their high growth rates, so we feel pretty good about the back half.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I mean, Kevin, just at a higher level, you mentioned sportswear, the very first category up front there today. So maybe just tell us a little bit about \u2013 you're in the second round there \u2013 maybe how you see the evolution of that sportswear business going over the next few years as far as maybe how you see distribution growing and when you think it could be a more meaningful contributor on the total company revenue line? And then same question for Connected Fitness.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Okay. So let me begin with sportswear. So there's four categories or ways that we think about our overall brand positioning with the different categories we have. The first would be on-field \u2013 and think about them left to right. On-field would be pleated. Sport performance would be things you could wear with a pair of jeans, like basketball. All the way out to the right would be sportswear, which is what we launched this past fall with UAS, and sitting right in the middle, which is the meat of the business, which is more than a third for our two largest competitors of their business, is what we call sports lifestyle.","So today, we obviously want to get to the sport lifestyle category, but we thought we'd have a better opportunity of doing that by putting this flag all the way out there which was UAS. And so having time for that to curate and position ourselves at the high end of fashion, giving us the ability to attack the massive market of sports lifestyle from the top versus trying to simply evolve it from the field. We believe that's important, so having that positioning is something that we're very bullish on.","Sport lifestyle still remains again our largest opportunity, and frankly, by a mile. And we look at the different categories of where we can grow and so everything we've been doing to authenticate ourselves has put us in a position for sport lifestyle.","It's not a new category for us, but I think I keep coming back to saying what's going to make us different and unique is that some brands rely on their logo being cool or a good line. What makes Under Armour unique is that every product does something. And so that DNA is something that we'll carry through into every product we do, and again, where the emphasis is not just going to be on the fiber technology.","Like, we get it. We're not just blind and saying we're just looking at product through a performance lens, but we think there's a much bigger opportunity. We think authenticity and equity are really what drive us there, and again, it's not something which needs to be a new category for the business. It needs to be something that can really evolve into our overall total business.","So look, we've got the cool people. We have access to all the same color agencies that the rest of them do. We feel like we're driving there in a big way. So we understand the emphasis of getting the lifestyle, but it doesn't mean abandoning what we have in performance. So wrapping our arms around the fact that we are a deep performance company and getting ourselves to the next step.","Connected Fitness, Michael, your question there?","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, just on how you see the evolution from here. Yeah.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","So I think it's a good opportunity for me just to sort of explain where we were when we made the acquisitions, the original vision that we had of becoming digital as a company, and what we think that pay off is for us.","So the Connected Fitness investment for us was always about having a better understanding of our consumer. And we viewed that through the lens though is that it would help us sell more shirts and shoes. To be clear, like that was the goal. And we believe that original vision is still very much intact.","The resources, community and team that Connected Fitness has given us has really \u2013 it's opened the aperture of the way that we believe consumers are going to expect an athletic brand to deliver for them in the future, like helping them make better decisions about how to improve their lives. Like it's not just going to be a cool logo or a nice shoe. It'll be all those things of course. And it'll be stylistically portrayed. But it also has to be in the context of how are you helping me live a healthier life.","So today just for perspective and a reminder, our Connected Fitness community, we have the number one app in the fitness store with just alone our MFP. Across the three or the four different apps that we have, we have over 200 million strong with more than 80,000 downloads occurring every single day, downloading one of our four apps and giving us the insight that we believe gets us much closer.","Now I mentioned we're just beginning to plug in some aspects of the SVOC program, the single view of the consumer, through some of our SAP go-lives. And we think the data that we'll have as a result of that is ultimately going to help us drive towards selling more shirts and shoes.","The information that we have with the holistic experience from fitness to activity to sleep and nutrition, we think gives us a purview, number one, that helps and is good for consumers and that we have great trust and respect of protecting that for them. But it also helps us be a better brand for them and help build better products that'll get them closer. And as you look at things like standing up Category Management, it's pretty powerful when we can see how many people went for a walk in Australia, or how many people are running, or what the average run trend was.","The last part I want to say is we also recognize that monetizing this is very important. We've been doing that. And again, understanding this is less than 2% of our total as a company. It doesn't mean that we like small numbers or accept them. So we recognize that we have today a pretty amazing ad platform in Connected Fitness and one that we want to drive forward. And so we're attacking that right now inside the existing businesses while utilizing this data.","The last thing I'll say about Connected Fitness, because when we get people looking at us and asking what the big plan there is, speaking now as the third-largest brand in the world with the two in front of us that are a long ways away, and the many behind us that are not too distant, we believe that Connected Fitness (49:55) differentiation for a potential quantum leap in our industry. And we think that's something that's only beginning to take hold and something that will play out over the next six months effectively, but through the next year and as we look to the future. And meanwhile, utilizing some of those resources just make us a better-connected company.","So we are bullish about our investment in digital and what this means and how this combines into not only the direct benefits for our consumer, but also how it ties back into our dot coms, our e-commerce, and giving us intelligence about our consumer and making us make better decisions, better products for them.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks a lot, guys.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Randy Konik of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Thanks a lot. I guess a question for Kevin. I just wanted to kind of get some perspective on how you think your marketing strategies will continue to evolve, or need to change or not change. We went from the football kids on the bus to now more athletes and you have Rock as well. So how do you think about \u2013 you have this huge community of fitness people with the MyFitnessPal, et cetera. How do you want to market digitally to them, showing them specific product or not?","And how do you think about the evolving message of the brand? Or to communicate some of the lifestyle offerings you plan to \u2013 you'll further bring to the market? How do you kind of try to want to change the marketing tactics with the consumer?","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Yeah. The kids on the bus is a good walk down memory lane. It is a great spot, and it was a different time, when people were just looking at the 30-second or the 60-second commercial that we ran during live broadcast.","Today it's changed very much. And I think that we've got some great amplifiers for us within the athletes that we have, the teams that we have, the partnerships that we signed recently. And it's really all-inclusive is that the understanding of what social means for us \u2013 and I don't think we've been a great social company to date. I don't think we've done a great job with our social media. And I think the understanding is that there's a couple ways for us to leverage our social media. One is that we have an incredible athlete community that's creating authentic content for us every single day. And simply as curators of our athlete community is something that I think that we can do to tell bigger bolder brand stories that keep us out there in the marketplace.","I think from a social media standpoint, you'll also see us get much better at what we do with telling product stories. The market is incredibly crowded now. The things that made Under Armour unique three or four or five years ago, everyone has their version of athletic something. Every company has gotten to their version of jumping on athleisure or jumping in and making their version of a tight. And so moving beyond just yarn differentiation of what makes our fiber or fabric better is no place for us to live.","And so I keep coming back and driving home this theme of, when you think about companies that last, and it's a difficult time for many retailers out there. As we look at it at Under Armour, like we understand the shifting landscape, we look at the investments that we've been making. We looked at 2017 and delivering what we said we're going to do. And we understand the focus that we have of making ourselves a better company by getting closer to Category Management and having the true insights that allow us to understand with that consumer wants and delivering for it.","Both \u2013 especially beginning with the product that delivers (53:20) for them, and the way that we communicate them is that Under Armour product, it's complex and what we've always done a good job (53:27) HeatGear was \u2013 you wore it for when it was hot and ColdGear for when it's cold. So we've got a lot more innovation. There's a much broader competitive set that we have now as well that we need to make sure we're explaining that product.","When I talk about our positioning for lifestyle, I think it's one that no other brand can have is that, it can be a beautiful sweater that's V-neck and comfortable and something that you could wear to the office or out to the club. We want to make that sweater, but we also think it's important that the sweater performs and maintains a DNA that's Under Armour. Now, we're not going to be blind to this. We just need to make beautiful products. We get it, but we also need to understand that the reason the consumer will buy our beautiful product is because of the DNA that makes us authentically Under Armour and authentically sport.","And so you'll continue to see us partner with whether it's the sleepwear line that we did with Tom Brady, the Project Rock collection that really begins to hit his consumer dead on and he's been a great partner for us \u2013 and also the reach that they have. Dwayne The Rock Johnson has over 80 million Instagram followers. And so when he gets behind something, it can move the needle. And so we actually have, amongst all of our athletes, we have a pretty powerful channel that you'll continue to see us activate. And you'll also continue to see them bring lifestyle more into what they're doing.","So that's a bit of a mixture question. Hopefully you got a bit of a mixture answer there between we expect to tell great stories about the products that we build, we expect them to be more relevant, more stylistic, more beautiful and still performing. And so I think we're just getting started on this journey, but we feel good about our bases and really where we're heading with it directionally.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","And can I just follow up with one more item? I'm just intrigued by the amount of \u2013 these systems and implementation and it sounds pretty exciting. Can you just give us maybe some perspective on any type of measuring sticks or yardsticks you're trying to kind of work towards like we think the systems can help us reduce our inventory levels by some amount or the liquidation levels can continue to move lower, our design-to-market cycles can be reduced by some level of X. And I'm just curious what your thoughts are there. And then, you said these systems are going to also help with things like the implementation of Curry 4. Are you going to kind of \u2013 is the system \u2013 these systems going to allow you to use a different type of (55:41) strategy, and so forth? Just curious there. Thanks.","David Bergman - Under Armour, Inc.","Randy, this is Dave. I'll take that. I mean, we're not going to give you specific numbers or percentages. But as Kevin mentioned, we're definitely investing in the one global instance of SAP across our business. So it really does enable us to simplify and automate our process and enable a more transparent supply chain.","The largest part of that implementation goes live in early Q3, but there will be stages after that, as well. It will definitely be creating capabilities to efficiently operate a value chain at scale. When you think about some of those future benefits you were mentioning, we'll definitely see some of that relative to revenue growth and speed to market. Definitely around inventory optimization. Also service-level improvements because there's a big supply chain component to that. And all that comes through on effective margin management, as well. So there's definitely a lot of exciting aspects that we'll see. I think you're going to see more of the meaningful improvements of that coming out in 2019 and beyond, but it's definitely a big play for us.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thank you, Randy.","Operator","Thank you. And now we'll take our last question from the line of Andrew Burns of D. A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Andrew S. Burns - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for all the details on the sportswear and lifestyle game plan, including the Unstoppable collection. As a follow-up, I'm trying to better understand how quickly you can pivot the assortment to where you want it to be with your key wholesale partners, as well as in DTC. From a consumer's point of view as they shop your key wholesale partners and DTC in the upcoming holiday season, how visible will this assortment shift be and how do you expect to communicate the lifestyle and sportswear initiatives to consumers? Thanks.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thank you. So I believe in 80\/20 rules and I still believe that the basis that we have is a foundation the people need. People need T-shirts and people need golf polos and people need quarter zips. But beyond that, there is a lifestyle component that we think that we can accelerate onto our brand.","The ability for us to effect that in Q1 and Q2; we looked at where we were in the first half of the year and frankly, the lessons learned coming out of the end of 2016 we said we think we can be better. And where we were able to effect once we had that information was really going after Q3 and Q4.","And it doesn't mean there needs to be a seismic shift, but it means some of the key items where \u2013 the Unstoppable collection was something that we drove hard, really from December last year to be able to deliver this year. So it's great practice for us of learning just how fast we can be as a company from a supply chain standpoint and understanding why we're not that fast everywhere. And so fast fashion and the way that they operate being close to consumer is something that we want to get a lot smarter about and something that we're continuing to drive.","We feel good about the collections that we have now. We feel good about the line that we have out on the floor. We're just saying we can be better, and better means a real sense of focus. And I guess if \u2013 when I started to feel and sort of look at the year and where we are, the one place that I've thrown myself into in the last several months and really looking at this year where I want to be going forward, it's just in the product. Any issue that anyone has with any company, you can write the greatest commercial, you can do anything that you want, but it just comes down to product.","And where we looked at 2017, and part of our alignment was, how do we get our product in line with being the kind of growth company that the market has become accustomed Under Armour being? We know how to do that. We haven't missed any trends in the marketplace. We could faster and we could be better. But again, this comes back to the foundations of what we're going to do going forward.","And so I think that people walk out and they're not sure if we understand what cool looks like and we can't do style, will the consumer wear us. I believe in the sport authenticity that we have. I believe the consumer likes us; I believe the consumer loves us. I believe we just have to tell them why they do, and most importantly we need to show them product that inspires them to want to love us. And so it is a \u2013 the consumer has a pretty short memory and they also have a really long, I think, affinity, though. So I think that we've established that to a point.","And where they might have gotten to know Under Armour as a tight shirt compression T-shirt company, we also then evolve to a full-scale athletic brand. Where they might have known us as just a North American company, I think we're doing a pretty good job evolving to being a true global brand. Where they might have known us as just a performance company and just that tight T-shirt, I think what you'll see is us continuing to evolve, moving into being a true company that could be worn in a lot more wearing occasions than just the gym, on the field, on the court or the pitch.","So we're pretty far down that road, and I think we feel pretty good about where we're going. We're not perfect. We don't think we're there yet. It all speaks into the guidance or the outlook that we provided for the year. So we're using 2017 as a year really to get better, and I think we've got a lot of seismic internal things that we're doing, meaning just make us a better company that will position us \u2013 because we haven't said the word being a $10 billion company in a while, and I want you to hear that. You're not hearing people talk about that, but I want you to know Under Armour's leaning forward, Under Armour is moving forward and we're moving on and ready to run.","Andrew S. Burns - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks and good luck.","Kevin A. Plank - Under Armour, Inc.","Thanks very much.","David Bergman - Under Armour, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Lance Allega - Under Armour, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.
