[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call will be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Homer Bhullar, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Homer Bhullar","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you've not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.","Joseph Gorder","Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that we had good operating performance in the second quarter despite having major turnarounds at our Houston, Memphis and Benicia refineries. We ran reliably during the quarter with very limited unplanned downtime. Gasoline cracks improved significantly in the second quarter relative to the first quarter in all regions boosting refining margins. However, the supplies of medium and heavy sour crude oils remained limited due to continued Venezuelan and Iranian sanctions and OPEC production curtailments resulting in narrower crude discounts for those grades relative to Brent crude oil. As a result, we optimized our system with additional domestic light sweet, Canadian heavy and Latin American crude oils. In fact, we set another record for Canadian heavy crude oil runs this quarter with over 190,000 barrels per day.","Turning to our renewable segments, the ethanol business generated positive operating income, despite a weak margin environment. And our growing renewable diesel business continues to generate strong results due to the high demand for renewable diesel. We continue to deliver on our commitment to grow Valero's earnings capability through organic growth investments. We successfully completed the Houston alkylation unit project in the second quarter as scheduled and on budget. This project is now allowing us to upgrade low-cost and abundant natural gas liquids and refinery olefins to produce a premium alkylate product. And we continue to make progress on the Central Texas pipelines and terminals project, which remains on track to be fully operational in the third quarter of this year.","Looking at organic growth beyond this year, we have a steady pipeline of projects to enhance the margin profitability of our portfolio. The Pasadena terminal, St. Charles alkylation unit and Pembroke cogeneration unit are expected to be completed in 2020. And the Diamond Green Diesel expansion and Port Arthur Coker are expected to be completed in late 2021 and 2022, respectively. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged with an annual CapEx for both 2019 and 2020 at approximately $2.5 billion with growth capital targeting projects with high returns that are focused on operating cost control, market expansion and margin improvement.","With respect to cash returns to stockholders, we continue to target an annual payout ratio of 40% to 50%. In the second quarter, we paid out $588 million to stockholders bringing the year-to-date total payout ratio to 50% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. Looking ahead, we're optimistic for the balance of the year with fundamentals supporting continued, healthy product demand.","Vehicle miles traveled continues to increase year-over-year, and we expect positive market impacts from the IMO 2020 implementation as bunker fuel terminals transition to lower-sulfur fuel oil. With our high complexity refineries, we believe that we're well-positioned to take advantage of the expected wider differentials for heavy crude oils and higher product cracks. Lastly, we remain committed to disciplined growth and to delivering long-term value to our stockholders through exceptional and environmentally responsible operations.","So, with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you.","Homer Bhullar","Thanks, Joe. For the second quarter of 2019, net income attributable to Valero's stockholders was $612 million or $1.47 per share compared to $845 million or $1.96 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Second quarter 2019 adjusted net income attributable to Valero's stockholders was $629 million or $1.51 per share compared to $928 million or $2.15 per share for the second quarter of 2018. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany this release.","Operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of 2019 was $1 billion compared to $1.4 billion for the second quarter of 2018. The decrease from the second quarter of 2018 was mainly attributed to significantly narrower medium and heavy sour crude oil differentials relative to Brent crude oil. Refining throughput volumes averaged 3 million barrels per day, which was 70,000 barrels per day higher than the second quarter of 2018. Throughput capacity utilization was 94% in the second quarter of 2019. Refining cash operating expenses for the second quarter of 2019 were $3.80 per barrel, in line with the second quarter of 2018.","The ethanol segment generated $7 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $43 million in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease from the second quarter of 2018 was primarily due to higher corn prices. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.5 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 531,000 gallons per day versus the second quarter of 2018, primarily due to added production from the three ethanol plants acquired in November 2018.","The renewable diesel segment generated $77 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $30 million in the second quarter of 2018. Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 769,000 gallons per day in the second quarter of 2019, an increase of 387,000 gallons per day versus the second quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income and sales volumes were primarily due to the expansion of the Diamond Green Diesel plant in the third quarter of 2018.","For the second quarter of 2019, general and administrative expenses were $199 million and net interest expense was $112 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $566 million and income tax expense was $160 million in the second quarter of 2019. The effective tax rate was 20%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $9.5 billion, and cash and cash equivalents were $2 billion. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 26%.","At the end of June, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. With regard to investing activities, we made $740 million of capital investments in the second quarter of 2019, of which approximately $510 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.5 billion in the second quarter. Excluding the impact from the change in working capital during the quarter, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion.","Moving to financing activities. We returned $588 million to our stockholders in the second quarter. $376 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 2.6 million shares of Valero common stock. This brings our year-to-date return to stockholders to $1 billion and the total payout ratio to 50% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities.","As of June 30, we had approximately $2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to expect annual capital investments for both 2019 and 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion with approximately 60% allocating to sustaining the business and approximately 40% to growth. The $2.5 billion includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments.","For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.71 million to 1.76 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 255,000 to 275,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 460,000 to 480,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be approximately $4.05 per barrel.","Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4.3 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2019. Operating expenses in 2019 should be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.16 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.","For 2019, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $840 million. The annual effective tax rate is still estimated at 23%. For the third quarter, net interest expense should be $114 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $560 million. Lastly, we still expect the RINs expense for the year to be between $300 million and $400 million.","That concludes our opening remarks. [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Manav Gupta from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Manav Gupta","Congrats on the good quarter. We understand that Brent Maya is a little tight right now. But when we look at the forward curves of Brent and 3% credit spread on Bloomberg, we assumed about a $8.50 or $9 widening in the next six months. Now since HSFO makes up 40% of the Maya pricing formula, mathematically, it translates to about $3 to $4 widening of Brent Maya. So, could the Brent Maya easily be $10, just following the pricing formula as it exists today or do you think Pemex, et cetera, try and step in and try and change the formula and get rid of high sulfur fuel oil pricing from the formula?","Joseph Gorder","Manav, that's a really good question. Why don't we let Gary give you some insight into that?","Gary Simmons","Yes. Manav, so I guess I'll answer the question on the formula first. Our discussions with PMI would indicate that they will change the formula in the coming weeks. So, we do expect a change in the formula. However, we do hold to your view on where heavy sour discounts are going. If you look at where Maya is today and the backwardation in the high sulfur fuel oil market, it would tell you around a $3 discount from where heavy sour discounts are today. And then if you look at the Western Canadian Select quote in the Gulf, even today, Western Canadian Select is discounted 15% to Brent, which is a good discount, even if you compare it to domestic light sweet alternatives such as MEH. Western Canadian Select is trading at 11% discount to MEH. The forward market on the Canadian side, at least there's trade being done in the fourth quarter already, and you're seeing Western Canadian Select discount at around $2.50 in the fourth quarter already. So that's pretty close to the $3 number that you were looking at.","Manav Gupta","A quick follow-up sticking to the Western Canadian Select. A Canadian major about 25 minutes ago on their call said that if deal with the government is struck, they could see rail ramping by 250,000 to 300,000 barrels by year-end. So that's a massive volume of crude landing in the Gulf Coast. I'm just trying to understand if this WCS does land on the Gulf Coast by year-end or, let's say, early 2020, can you seamlessly switch between WCS, Maya or any heavy grades that you were running?","Gary Simmons","Yes, pretty much. And we've had discussions and would concur with that view that the rail volume will be ramping up and had a lot of discussions with producers. And we take that into our Port Arthur refinery, and it pretty much is a direct replacement for Maya.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Douglas Leggate","Joe, last time you and I sat down, we talked about your underappreciated, let's say, flexibility on light crude. My question is obviously the alky units helping a little bit on NGLs. But as we look into the second half of this year and then into 2020, the ramp up, the expected ramp up from the Permian, it was coming with a lot of question marks over what the gravity of that crude is going to look like and the potential for an renewed period of, let's say, dislocations in pricing. I'm just curious if you could talk through what Valero's opportunity would be in that situation. Could you take advantage of that? Or obviously, your complex system is -- folks normally think about you as advantaged by things like WCS. I'm curious as to whether you could exploit that opportunity as well. I've got a follow-up, please.","Gary Simmons","Doug, this is Gary again. So, we certainly are maximizing light sweet into the system. In the second quarter, we used about 89% of our available capacity, and really, what was left on the table was primarily due to turnaround activity. As we move forward, we expect to utilize all of that. As the gravity gets lighter, we are seeing this WTL \"coming out,\" which is a lighter grade of WTI. We started running some of that in Three Rivers. I think in the second quarter, we ran 5,000 to 10,000 barrels a day of that, and we've also purchased some for future runs at Memphis. I think we're scheduled to run about 40,000 barrels a day of WTL in Memphis in September. So, we're certainly moving in that direction and watching the spreads, and the discount is there. We have a lot of flexibility being able to take it into our system.","Douglas Leggate","Okay. Are you retooling, Gary? Or are you pretty much just flexing within the constraints of the system?","Gary Simmons","It is pretty much within the constraints of the system. However, the new toppers we built at Corpus and Houston give us a lot more flexibility in this area.","Douglas Leggate","Great stuff. My follow-up -- go ahead, Joe.","Joseph Gorder","I think that's -- Doug, our position on that, when we're going to expand our saturation gas plant at Port Arthur as a part of the coker project. So, in 2022, we'll also have an increased capability to run light sweet.","Douglas Leggate","Okay. I have no doubt that you guys will be taking advantage where you can. My follow-up is, Joe, is really more of a macro question. This time last year, the optimism was perhaps a little egregious on IMO impacts. Have you seen anything yet in terms of turning tanks or indicated demand? There seems to be a lot of news coming out of pretty much a lot of international refiners on the compliant fuels that they are now able to supply. Has your expectation for the impact of IMO on distillate margins eased any? Or are you still pretty constructive on the disruptive impact as we go into next year? And I'll leave it there.","Joseph Gorder","Thanks, Doug. And I mean, I guess our view all along has been that we would probably start to see something third -- late third to fourth quarter of this year. It's been interesting, Doug, that the forward markets really haven't reflected the distillate impact. I think we're starting to see it in other places, but do you guys want to share your views?","Gary Simmons","No, I think you are seeing people start to turn tanks, and that's one of the reasons you see high sulfur fuel oil strength, is it's just a not a very liquid market today and ships are having trouble actually buying high sulfur fuel oil, which is bidding that market up today, so you see the steep backwardation as we approach that January time line. And I agree with Joe, all the estimates I still see show a fairly significant step change in diesel demand when the IMO bunker spec changes, and it's not reflected in the forward curve today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup.","Prashant Rao","I wanted to touch back on the Western Canadian Select availability. 190,000 barrels per day in this quarter is still running strong there. And as we expect that discount to widen with rail hitting the Gulf, I wanted to get a sense of your ability to lean into that a bit more. How much could you ramp beyond the 190,000? And as you're looking at incremental rail contract, what sort of -- give us some idea what sort of duration maybe you're thinking? Or do you have the contracting -- contract in hand you need and we're just going to see that sort of flex up in the numbers as we go forward as you take advantage of those discounts?","Gary Simmons","Yes. We have a lot of flexibility to run the heavy Canadian. We're primarily advantaged to run it at our Texas City and Port Arthur refinery just because we have the best logistics to be able to get into those two assets. Between those two refineries, probably a capacity about 300,000 barrels a day today to process it. We can run about 50,000 a day at St. Charles, and we could run some at Corpus Christi as well, but again, the logistics of getting that in are more challenged. On the rail side, we continue to work with producers, and we're doing deals on a delivered basis, whereas in the past we were buying barrels in Western Canada and shipping them ourselves, and that volume will continue to ramp up as we get those deals done.","Prashant Rao","Okay. It's very helpful. And then just switching back on sort of a bigger picture question. With the Houston alky project getting completed, I wanted to take a step back and get your views on where you guys are finding the whole system in the country stands in terms of Tier 3 compliance. I think we're getting the Seymour teams. There has been so much that we're looking at and refining in terms of the macro. So, a few questions that may be concerns about how tight octane is going to get by the time we get to 1Q '20. Just your updated views at what you -- how you think the system stands today in terms of the progress we're making. And then, I guess, relatively speaking, where your position is relative to that? It feels like you'd be advantaged in that kind of a tight octane market. But any color you can provide there would be helpful.","Lane Riggs","Yes. This is Lane. So, we've always had a strategic outlook that octane was going to get more valuable as Tier 3 matured and finally came to us ahead here at the end of the year and combined that with sort of cheap NGLs. That was the reason we did these projects and they're coming online at exactly the right time. You were definitely seeing -- we believe we're seeing octane get more and more expensive. In terms of where the industry is on a Tier 3 compliance, we're trying to -- we're looking at that ourselves. But if you look at us as a proxy for that, we still have three units that have to come online by the end of the year. So, there's still some more octane disruption in the industry ahead of us.","Joseph Gorder","I mean, people's implementation though has been, I would say, somewhat muted or delayed as...","Lane Riggs","Been using credits.","Joseph Gorder","Yes, they were using credits. And to the extent you could use credits, you defer the capital, but now we're getting to the point where the rubber meets the road, and it's going to be a lot of makeup activity or we are going to see this spread continue to expand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley.","Benny Wong","Just wanted to ask about the capture rate in the second quarter. It's particularly weak in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Understand the light\/heavy differentials probably contribute to that. But just wanted to get a sense if there's any other factors weighing on that. If there is any risk of those factors persisting. And conversely, in North Atlantic, the capture is really strong. It has been strong for a couple quarters. Just wanted to get a sense is it Europe or U.S. driving that, and should we expect a higher capture level going forward?","Lane Riggs","Benny, this is Lane. And for Prashant, I'm sorry, a while ago, I called you Benny. So -- and the Gulf Coast is a good proxy for what -- in terms of capture rate, we're down about 20% year-over-year. About 10% to maybe 12% of that is crude differentials, some of it's ours, some of it's just quality. But the remaining 7% to 8% is non-gasoline products. Everybody sort of talks about naphtha and how cheap it is, but the other products that are also discounted year-over-year are propylene and propane. So, you can sort of come to your own conclusion about what direction propylene is going to, and obviously propane, NGLs are just getting cheaper and cheaper or follow the oil shale. We're still optimistic that -- and the rest of it's -- we're optimistic that, as Gary alluded to, that IMO 2020 will help improve the medium and heavy sour discounts in terms of where naphtha is going and propylene is going. I mean, they are probably structurally pretty weak for at least some period of time here. And then on the Line 9 or Atlantic, really what you're seeing on the North Atlantic capture rate is our continued advantaged position on our Line 9 crudes.","Benny Wong","Got it. Appreciate the color there. My follow-up is really, one of your peers has been talking about, just preparing ahead of IMO 2020 was really looking to take advantage of slack coking capacity within their system and maybe redirecting excess fuel oils from one part of the portfolio into other areas where there might be excess capacity. Is this something that you guys looked at within your portfolio? Or is there an opportunity for that? Seems like more of a logistical optimization exercise, just curious is that something that you guys looked at?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So, I guess, what you're saying is where we have fuel oil length potentially taking it to open coking capacity. Is that the question?","Benny Wong","Yes. Essentially, the question is do you guys have some areas where you have slack coking capacity and if there are areas where you have fuel oil length, exactly what you're saying.","Gary Simmons","Yes. So, we don't make much oil in our system, and we pretty much keep our coking capacity full. We are providing some flexibility with the Port Arthur coking project to take some fuel oil we produce at Meraux and potentially run it in the Port Arthur Coker when it's expanded.","Lane Riggs","To Gary's point, what you'll actually see -- so we plan to be full at both coker and like he said, we don't make much fuel oils in the system. But what it does do is it competes, just like some of the long resid today that competes for crude capacity, and that we do believe you're going to see more and more of that, as some of these blending components that run 3.5% to 8% fuel oil will ultimately have to probably get ran through crude units and compete with other medium and heavy sour crude. That's obviously why we feel pretty good about the cost of feedstock from here going into next year as a result of IMO 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research.","Sam Margolin","Lane, can I ask you a follow-up about the capture rate impact and naphtha, because you sort of touched on something that's swirling around the market. Was there anything -- were you producing sort of excess naphtha or LPGs for any reason besides just an increase in light crude throughput in the Gulf Coast? Was there something coming out of the 1Q turnaround or something having to do with the 2Q turnaround at Houston that exacerbated the capture rate impact of the commodity dispersion that you quoted with naphtha and LPGs?","Lane Riggs","Not really. I mean, we did have the turnarounds and so have to go back. And if anything, we would have run more crude and had more naphtha. And our reformers were full. Right now, one of the most economic units in addition to alky is our reformer. And so, we would have had our reformer signaled full. So, I'd have to go look and see what the balance was on naphtha, but we weren't -- directionally, it's just we make the -- we have a position on naphtha, and it goes if we get longer, is we run more and more light sweet crude.","Gary Simmons","I think exactly. It's really more of a function of the crude diet and then the other factors. A lot of the U.S. Gulf Coast naphtha was going to Venezuela and diluent. And so certainly, as that has shut off, it's caused naphtha to get weaker.","Sam Margolin","Okay. And then this is sort of an IMO question. There's some reports that bring up here and there about heavy sweet crude pricing. It's pretty scarce, and this isn't the case everywhere heavy sweet is available, but it's printing at some pretty wide premiums to Brent in certain locations. Is this an IMO signal? Or is this like an idiosyncratic weird crude that just trades off-spec and doesn't mean anything?","Lane Riggs","Gary and I will tag-team this. I think a lot of those crudes are either from Angola or Brazil. And they have -- it's going to be interesting to see how they fit in the IMO 2020 universe. I mean, there's some belief that you can burn directly. I mean, I'm not sure that's the highest value for them necessarily, but -- and there is some substitution effect as you're seeing some of these heavy sour crudes come off, they -- these are substitute crudes for coking refineries. And so, they've certainly gotten the word that's not necessarily the best grade. But if you look at the things they have is they don't have a lot of naphtha in them. So, I mean, it's the world just sort of resorting out that quality.","Gary Simmons","Yes. I think that's a lot of what you see today, is as people have pushed a lot more the light sweet, they're getting loaded up on the top end of their distillation column and some of these medium sweets allow them to push rate as long as the crack spreads are strong.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","First question is around renewable diesel. And just trying to figure out how we should think about this business in the context of Valero. How big do you want it to be? And related to the segment, there's some big swings on profitability. One could be a Blender's Tax Credit. The other is how you see the low-carbon fuel standard playing out in California. So just some -- any high-level thoughts on the segment. How you see it playing out over time? And then how we should think about some of the swings that could drive some upside optionality on the profitability here?","Martin Parrish","Neil, this is Martin. We expect low-carbon fuel mandates to grow across the globe. In Europe, you've got the Renewable Energy Directive now out to 2030. You got the low-carbon fuel standard in California out to 2030. There's talk, on again and off again about Canada adopting the standard. So, we're bullish on this and we're actively evaluating opportunities for expansion where they make sense. As far as the Blender's Tax Credit, obviously, if that comes in, that's a big upside for us. If it doesn't, we're still in good shape. We did a $1.26 EBITDA in this last -- second quarter with no Blender's Tax Credit. If you look in California, they are already blending at 10% renewable diesel. There is really no limit to where you can get with renewable diesel, meets the same specs as hydrocarbon diesel. So, we feel good about the prospects. We've got a great partner with Darling that's -- for the feedstock procurement and the front-end processing. So, we plan to keep growing the business.","Joseph Gorder","Jason, anything on the Blender's Tax Credit?","Jason Fraser","Yes. I'll be glad to talk about that. As you all probably know, the Blender's Tax Credit expired at the end of 2017, and both the Senate and the House tax-writing committees are looking at bills to extend it. They've got a bill that will extend two years in the Senate, and the House has a bill that will extend it for three years. And we believe it's going to get -- we're not sure exactly how it will get done or which bill it will get attached to, but we're confident it will get done by the end of the year. That's certainly our expectation, likely through the appropriations process that takes place this fall.","Neil Mehta","That's great. It's an interesting business. The other one -- it's been a while since we've asked about RINs here. They have kind of picked their head back up in terms of the D6 RINs price. Not enough for us to get super concerned, but something at least to watch from the periphery. So just any thoughts in terms of how we should think about the RINs market from here, especially because there is uncertainty around the degree of waivers for small refinery exemptions here in 2019.","Jason Fraser","Yes, sure. This is Jason. I'll give you our update on some of the recent developments on the RFS front. On June 15, the EPA published their final rule, which granted the 1-pound RVP waiver to E15 year round and also made some limited market reforms to the RIN market. We don't think either of those is really going to radically change the landscape. There are many reasons E15 hadn't taken off in the past, and those are still here, even with the RVP waiver, like concerns about using it in older cars, potential capital requirements at stations. And we also understand there will probably be a legal challenge to whether the EPA has authority to grant that waiver as well. So that's going to be an additional wait on the market as people wait and see if the waiver is going to -- or the additional waiver holds up, which will -- but there is definitely some question about whether the EPA has the authority to do that or whether it has to be done by Congress.","And as for the RIN market reforms the EPA adopted, which are really just a public disclosure when a company goes over a certain RIN holding threshold, and then adding some data reporting requirements. We don't think they're going to make much of a difference. It's really inadequate to improve the functioning of the RIN market a lot. So, the bottom line is we don't think either of those is going to be a dramatic effect on the RIN market.","Regarding small refiner waivers, which you mentioned, there's been a lot of discussion in the press about them lately. The biofuel lobby has been aggressively pushing to not have them granted this year. And this is despite multiple studies that show the SREs haven't led to any real biofuel demand destruction. But that SRE process is very well established as part of the RFS statute, and the EPA has gotten guidance from Congress as well as several court cases on how to administer them. So, we're confident the EPA is going to continue to follow the law and hopefully will be announcing their decisions on the 2018 applications soon. We think from their website they have about 38 applications pending for 2018.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Philip Gresh","A couple quick ones here. One is as we continue to see these increased flows out of the Permian to Texas Gulf Coast of light sweet crude, how are you envisioning things playing out in Corpus Christi, given the inflow versus outflow situation there and the timing of certain export terminals?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So, Phil, our focus here is really to have been -- get connected to all the lines that make their way to Corpus, and we made a lot of progress there. So, we can receive pretty much all of the lines that are coming in. And then we've also doing some dock work at Corpus to where we can export more to Qu\u00e9bec and Pembroke and that work will be finished in the fourth quarter as well, which will give us more control on that supply chain on exports into our system. I really can't comment too much on it. I guess what you're kind of asking more about is, is there enough dock capacity to clear the oil? And I don't know that I have a lot of insight whether that's the case or not.","Philip Gresh","Okay. Second question would just be around the grade of crude that's going to be coming down those pipelines, a lot more of the West Texas light that everyone has been talking about. Just kind of wondering how you think about running that grade of crude through your system versus more of a WTI grade. What capacity you might have to run West Texas light? And given Lane's comments just around the lightening of the crude slate and the impact that has on NGL and naphtha margins coming out, is that something that you consider as you think about what type of crude you want to run?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So, Phil, it's just all a matter of price. We have plenty of capacity to be able to process the barrel. Historically, we've seen a lot of the light material that makes its way to the Gulf price such that we don't have an economic incentive to run it, and it goes to the export market. Some of the WTL that's been making its way to Corpus has been pricing at $1.25 type discount to MEH. And so, we've seen some incentive to buy it. And if that's the case, we certainly have a lot of capacity to run it, but it will depend on how its prices.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","I guess maybe -- come back, Lane, to your comments about the Gulf Coast and the light\/heavy differentials impact that's had. But it was interesting to me in the quarter year-over-year, you actually had a better distillate yield relative to gasoline yield despite, I guess, running a somewhat lighter slate. So, I just wonder if you could kind of give us an idea of how that's happened because it seems a little contrary to the kind of the conventional wisdom, run more lights, get more gasoline? And then maybe how that tied in also to the issue with the excess naphtha? I'm just trying to kind of understand how it seems like you're running a better heavy slate in terms of product with a lighter yield, yet the lights caught you on the capture in the end.","Lane Riggs","Yes. So, Roger, what I would say is we did have the FCC down in Houston -- the whole FCC Houston alky complex was down from -- a big chunk of the quarter, so consequently, our gasoline production was off. In terms of naphtha, we are -- again, with the signal's been max reformer the whole time. So, as you increment into the light sweet, it leads to us, and I believe the industry is in the same spot, as you run more and more light sweet, more of it has to be exported, and ultimately, it clears in the Far East. And so, it doesn't go in the gasoline. Now there will be, and I'm sure part of what's happening right now with this Tier 3 is saturating the gasoline and lowering octane and there's just an abundance of naphtha, everybody is trying to figure out a way to get naphtha back into the gasoline pool. But you need octane to do that. And right now, the industry is trying to get that -- figure out that balance as again, as Tier 3 is getting acclimated.","Roger Read","Okay. Maybe as a quick follow-up on that. What or who or where is our best incremental source of octane outside of the U.S.?","Gary Simmons","Well, that's a good question. We've seen some imports, but I can't tell you exactly where that's coming from. Historically, India excesses alkylate, and we see some trade flow of barrels from India coming over. The other thing you see today is that either toluene and xylene is using as a gasoline blend component, with where its prices, you have an incentive to blend naphtha with toluene to make gasoline. So that's another source of octane.","Lane Riggs","To Gary's point, the issue you have around that, at some point on the reformulated gasoline fuels, you'll read a toxic limit. That's where alkylate is really important. It allows you -- as you get more alkylate in the pool, it allows you to incrementally raise the amount of aromatics in the gasoline as well. But yes.","Roger Read","We could probably spend the whole call on these kind of intricacies.","Lane Riggs","That was -- yes, exactly.","Roger Read","As a follow-up question, ethanol, really weak. You did the acquisition -- I don't remember if it closed into the very beginning of the year or very end of last year, but it's been a tough period here in ethanol. We've seen some competitors shutting down some of their plants and refinancing their companies and everything. Obviously, your size, you're not worried about making it through the process. But I was just wondering light at the end of the tunnel, is that a 2020 thing? Is it -- we have to know how the '19 corn crop turned out? Is it the trade issues with China? Can maybe an order of what matters in magnitude of those events, if you could?","Martin Parrish","Roger, this is Martin. Yes. If you look at the -- this is the latest corn crop really in the history of the record, which goes back 40 years. So, you've got the latest corn crop and right now, so the December CBOT price was $3.70 a bushel in early May, went to $4.70 a bushel by mid-June. Now it's back down to about $4.30. So, there's just a lot of uncertainty how big is the crop. And what really matters is the carryout at the end of this 2019 crop year. And nobody knows at this point. There's still weather that could impact it. So, it's going to be hard to have real big ethanol margins for this crop here in the U.S. Now obviously if China opens up, that helps a lot. That's a little different story, right. They have a 10% mandate, and that would make a big difference on the exports right away. Absent that, you're going to see -- you saw our forward guidance is lower than we ran. So, we're going to trim a little bit. A lot of people are going to have to trim more. We've got a great fleet. In the long term, when you're relying on a crop, these things happen, right? We've had five years now where yields have been above trend and then due for one below it. So, we'll get through this. Obviously, we're still bullish about ethanol. Long term, it's a great octane component. It's part of the fuel mix to stay, so we'll be there with it.","Joseph Gorder","Two things I would add to what Martin said. First of all, the industry is just overproduced for what it is today. That's the fundamental problem here. So, what have we done? Well, we have ramped up exports as an industry, and that's where tariffs become a factor in these things. And it takes a while in the developed markets, but we have been, Valero has been very aggressive in exporting ethanol and we'll continue to be aggressive going forward. The other thing, and Jason spoke to this earlier, was the whole E15 issue. The ethanol industry broadly has this notion allowing E15, which as we said will be challenged, is going to solve some of this problem. Frankly, I think the solution to this problem is a higher octane fuel that helps with CAFE, and it could be a nationwide standard like 95 RON. It would require more ethanol to be blended into the fuel mix. It would take all the arguments out of what types of fuel we're going to produce in market broadly. And if we could just get everybody synced up. This is one of the things where amazingly, the autos are on board, the retail marketers are on board, refiners are okay with this. And in the ethanol industry, we've seen that this was a good solution to this problem that we're facing. Perhaps we could make some progress, but there is a genuine distrust, and we're going to have to get over that. But we will continue to bash away on this, because I agree with Martin. Ethanol is going to be part of the fuel mix for a very long time, and it will recover.","Roger Read","Yes, probably part of the problem of building it on a mandate as opposed to a market incentive to pull more product in.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotia Howard Weil.","Joseph Gorder","Is this Paul Cheng?","Paul Cheng","Believe or not. Two quick questions. Maybe this is either for Lane or Gary. I know that you guys don't produce a lot of resid, but when you're looking at the bunker fuel market, going into the very low sulfur fuel oil, do you know or that -- I mean, how are you guys going to go around to get there? I mean, are you going to take the VGO or that you're trying to brand the high sulfur fuel oil into that? And what do you think the industry approach is going to be?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So, Paul, we've been working very hard to develop low sulfur fuel oil blends. We work with several shipping companies. We currently have, I think, three shipping companies burning our low sulfur fuel oil blend. So, we've been working hard to be able to produce compliant fuel.","Paul Cheng","Gary, can you share with us that -- I mean, what is the path or the approach that you guys take? Because it seems like it's very, very inefficient to trying to use the high sulfur fuel oil and blend it with the ultra-low sulfur diesel into that. Seems like that it more makes sense to using the VGO. But if that's the case, we will have a major problem of the much lower gasoline yield?","Gary Simmons","Yes. That's exactly right, Paul. So, what we're looking at is some of these low sulfur heavy streams that we typically run through to tack crackers, taking some of those barrels out and being able to blend compliant low sulfur fuel oil with those rather than taking a high sulfur fuel oil stream.","Lane Riggs","Paul, this is Lane. The two places that we're doing that really are Pembroke and Qu\u00e9bec, and we really don't start with a high sulfur resid. We start with something that's maybe a moderate sulfur and it depends on the crude economics, and then we start blending it up.","Paul Cheng","I see. Gary and Lane, that you guys -- for the industry as a whole, do you think how much is the VGO they are going to take out for this purpose?","Lane Riggs","I don't know that we have a macro view of that. But we've sort of talked all along about this idea that VGO at some point will have to maintain its parity into an FCC or the gasoline and obviously, back to this low sulfur fuel oil market. And therefore, it's supportive of gasoline, to your point earlier. It will essentially cause -- it's a linkage between FCC economics and then just straight up low sulfur fuel oil into the bunker market, which is going to be connected with diesel. So, I think a lot of people thought they'd be disconnected, but they're not. It's really through the VGO. But in terms of how much, there are compatibility issues. There's all sorts of things around this that everybody is working on, and we'll just have to see how much of it -- how much you can get into the blends.","Paul Cheng","A final question. I mean, even if we can fix the -- diesel issue, I mean, that the resulting high sulfur fuel oil seems like is still going to be a problem. Do you guys have -- I mean, you don't produce it, and indeed, you are a net buyer of the resid. So, if resid price crashed down to zero, it would be great for you. Any idea that -- I mean, what is really the alternative use that we can do with all the excess high sulfur resid?","Lane Riggs","It's primarily power generation that's for the other -- and we don\u2019t know the market depth of that or how much can be absorbed. I think it all depends on OPEC and how much it produces and how much substitution they can do. Instead of where they were burning crude, they can burn some of these high sulfur fuel oil. Our belief is that it's still long. Particularly once OPEC starts recovering in their production, that's why we're not -- we feel good about our assets in light of this problem that you're talking about.","Paul Cheng","Lane, how easy for the industry be able to feed the high sulfur resid back into the coker and use it as a feed? I mean, you guys don't -- already doing some, but the industry as a whole, do we have a lot of opportunity doing that?","Lane Riggs","I think everybody is on a learning curve on that. We've been doing it a long time. We run a lot of resids. So, we have a pretty good understanding. The issue you get into is you've got to find a way to run it and maintain your defaulter operation that's heavier, it doesn't have the light stuff, so you don't get good mixing. And there is other challenges. It depends on the configuration of the refinery. And I'm sure as it gets distressed in the marketplace, there will be a lot of -- there will be -- everybody will try to accelerate and figure out how much they can run.","Joseph Gorder","Paul, it was good to see -- hear you back, and you were true to form.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Flam with Simmons Energy.","Patrick Flam","I really wanted to ask you about capital spending trends so far this year. If I'm doing my math right, it looks like you've spent about $1.5 billion so far out of the $2.5 billion 2019 target, which implies to me that your spending is going to drop off into the second half of the year. I was hoping you could just walk me through the moving pieces there. And if this is a reflection of lower turnaround activity levels or lower project spending or whatever those pieces might be?","Lane Riggs","It's both. This is Lane. It's both of those. We've had a pretty heavy turnaround period, and we don't have nearly as much turnaround activity for the rest of the year. And then two, you're just not as productive those last 2 or 3 months of the year because of all the holidays. So, it's really a combination of that.","Joseph Gorder","Yes. It's not that unusual to find ourselves in this situation. I mean, and things will move a little bit within this. Sometimes we're slightly below, sometimes we're above, but I mean, the $2.5 billion number is just kind of our nominal expectation what we're going to spend. And again, you kind of do it as you have to, so.","Lane Riggs","Well, and to that point, I mean, when we had the tube leak at Benicia, that was the turnaround that we had planned in the first quarter of 2020, that we had to bring into this year. So, we had to bring on a number -- $80 million or $90 million of turnaround spend from one year to the next. And so, some things like that can happen.","Patrick Flam","Okay. Great. That's really helpful. My follow-up question is essentially -- I know you guys aren't directly impacted by this, but I was hoping you could frame up any expectations you have for longer-term market impact from the potential closure of the PES refinery on the East Coast.","Gary Simmons","Yes. So obviously it's going to tighten the market there, 350,000 barrel a day refinery. That refinery produced a lot of premium gasoline, 35,000 barrels a day of premium gasoline, and our strategy in that region has been able to supply the market primarily from Pembroke. And so, we have good logistics assets in place to be able to take advantage of that short. And Pembroke is a refinery that has a lot of capability to produce octane, and so that's primarily what we're working on today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.","Jason Gabelman","I actually wanted to follow up on the Philadelphia Energy refinery closure. So obviously, gasoline margins strengthened off the fire and have come back a bit. And I'm wondering what you attribute the increase to and if you think that's going to be sustained through 3Q. It seems like there's a lot of gasoline supply in the market. So, I wonder if it's a matter of months those imports kind of hit the East Coast, margins are going to fall back off or maybe there is somewhat of an octane shortage that could support gasoline margins through the rest of 3Q? And I have a follow-up.","Gary Simmons","Yes. So, this is Gary. I think our view is, if you look at the DOE stats for the last couple of weeks, it looks like demand has been down. But our view is that demand will be revised back upward and that you'll see actually net exports fall off. And a lot of that is the reason that you pointed to. After the fire and announced closure, you had a $0.03 a gallon open ARB to ship gasoline from Northwest Europe to New York Harbor. And so, its incentivized imports there. PADD 5 we saw imports even after the refinery utilization came back. And then in the U.S. Gulf Coast, with the octane strength, we're seeing some import of components into the U.S. Gulf Coast as well. And so, demand is good, but the net exports, mainly due to imports being down, is kind of what's caused the build that we've seen the last couple weeks. And it does look like that the market is cooling off some, and you're already seeing signs that that's reversing, especially in PADD 5. We've gone from seeing imports to it looks like a couple refiners are putting export cargos together, and you're seeing barrels from California flow into the Arizona market to help clear that as well. So, I do think it's a trend you'll see reverse.","Jason Gabelman","Do you have a view if the world is kind of maxed out on how much octane it can produce right now?","Gary Simmons","Yes. I think the combination of the things Lane talked about with Tier 3 gasoline destroying some octane and then globally, refiners running a very light diet and excessing naphtha and trying to fit naphtha back into the pool has caused octane to be very tight globally.","Jason Gabelman","Got it. And if I can just ask a follow-up. Mexico is working to revamp its existing refineries in addition to building a new one. But assuming they are successful on the former, it could have implications for U.S. product exports. Is Valero thinking of kind of continuing its strategy to push its logistical reach into new markets, similar to what it did in Peru to kind of combat the potential for the Mexican market to close up a bit to the U.S. for product exports?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So, we currently are exporting about -- that we sell ourself about 30,000 barrels a day direct sales into Mexico. That will continue to ramp up. We're building our marine terminal in Veracruz and have a strategy in the North as well. For Mexico to do much on revamping their refining system, it involves a lot. It's not just the refineries, but it's also a lot of logistics and able to get logistics that were meant to move crude out, now to move crude in. So, it's going to be a long time coming before they can do much in terms of revamping their refining system.","Joseph Gorder","Yes. I agree with Gary completely. And then if you look at the new plant that they have in mind, obviously, the capital cost is going to be much higher than they had originally forecasted. If you are a country and you want to do something as a matter of national pride, and economic returns aren't the primary driver to the investment, then something like that probably makes sense. But certainly, the most efficient way for Mexico to supply its shorts is from the U.S. Gulf Coast.","Operator","And we have a question from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Blair","Joe, I think you could say that Valero has the biggest investment in new alkylation capacity in the industry, just with your projects at Houston and St. Charles. Could you talk about how this will change your overall net exposure in alkylate? Are you net short today? And after these projects are done, would you become net long?","Joseph Gorder","Gary, you or Lane?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So, I don't know that -- it's all a matter of economics of where alkylate trades. So, we have flexibility where we can sell alkylate direct. The additional alkylate in the pool allows us to make more RBOB versus CBOB. And it also allows us to make a lot more export grades that are required in some of the Latin American markets. So, it will be all a matter of price of what path we choose to go, but we have flexibility to do any of those things.","Matthew Blair","Sounds good. And then I think the top end of your throughput guidance for Q3 '19 is about 4% below what you did last year. I think that the turnaround schedule lightens up this quarter. Could you just talk about what the constraints are? Why the volumes are coming in fairly low for Q3?","Lane Riggs","Yes. This is Lane. We don't really give -- we just give the ranges. We don't really give sort of any sort of maintenance guidance really. So as long as we did that, we don't normally give that kind of guidance. We just -- the bottom line is they are what they are.","Joseph Gorder","Yes, and Matthew, you know what goes into the volume forecast. So, it is what it is.","Matthew Blair","I mean, does this reflect like any sort of economic run cuts?","Lane Riggs","No.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Homer Bhullar for any closing remarks.","Homer Bhullar","Thanks, Catherine. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Obviously, if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team.

My name is Lorissa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ashley Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Ashley Smith","Thank you, Lorissa, good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Joe Gorder, President and COO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.","Before we get started, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the Company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under Federal Securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Okay, as noted in the release, we reported second quarter 2013 earnings of $466 million or $0.85 per share. The results include after-tax charges to general and administrative expenses of $20 million or $0.04 per share and income tax expense of $9 million or $0.01 per share, both related to the May 1 spinoff of CST Brands to Valero's stockholders.","In addition, the results include after-tax charges to G&A expenses of $34 million related to various environmental and legal matters.","Second quarter 2013 operating income was $808 million versus operating income of $1.4 billion in the second quarter of 2012. The decrease was mainly due to lower refining margins in each of our operating regions.","Our second quarter 2013 refining throughput margin of $9.26 per barrel was over $1 per barrel lower versus the second quarter 2012 margin of $10.63 per barrel. The decrease was partly due to significantly lower discounts per heavy sour crude oil.","For example, the Maya crude oil discounts to Brent crude oil decreased by $4.40 per barrel from the second quarter of 2012 to the second quarter of 2013. Fortunately the Maya discount has improved by more than $3, over $3 per barrel with July month today discounts to Brent of nearly $8.20 per barrel.","Also contributing to the decrease in margins were the lower discounts per medium sour crude oil and light crude oil. For example the Mars crude oil discount to Brent crude oil decreased by $0.69 per barrel in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012.","For light crude oil on the Gulf Coast, the LLS crude oil was a slight discount to Brent crude oil in the second quarter of 2012 versus the premium in the second quarter of 2013, for an increase of about $1.80 per barrel.","In addition, the refining throughout margin was negatively impacted by the higher costs of Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs needed to comply with the U.S. Federal Renewable Fuel Standard.","For the second quarter of 2013, the reported cost to comply were a $125 million versus $58 million for the second quarter of 2012. Given the recent escalation in RINs prices, we now estimate our cost to comply with the renewable fuel standard to be in the range of $600 million to $800 million for the full year of 2013.","Another factor that affected the refining margins was the higher cost of natural gas. Natural gas prices increased from $2.24 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2012 to $4 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2013. In addition to effect in our operating expenses, this increase impacts our cost of sales due to our use of hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas. So far in the third quarter, natural gas prices have favorably decreased about $0.40 per MMBtu versus last quarter.","Our second quarter 2013 refining throughput volumes averaged 2.6 million barrels per day, for a decrease of 52,000 barrels per day from the second quarter of 2012, caused mainly by turnarounds and planned maintenance at our Quebec City, McKee, Port Arthur, and Meraux refineries.","Refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter of 2013 were $3.82 per barrel, which was higher than second quarter of 2012 due mainly to higher energy costs.","I\u2019d like to highlight several other items in our refining operations. First, the new hydrocracker at Port Arthur has continued to perform well and contribute to earnings. In the second quarter of 2013, we estimate the new Port Arthur hydrocracker contributed approximately $80 million in EBITDA with the throughput rates nearly at capacity and achieving high conversion rates. The contribution is slightly lower than last quarter due to changes in market prices for key drivers such as higher natural gas prices, lower naphtha values, and lower butane values during the summer RVP gasoline blending season.","Using 2012 average prices, we estimate EBITDA would have been approximately $120 million.","We look forward to the contribution from the recently completed St. Charles hydrocracker, which is essentially a clone of the Port Arthur unit. Earlier in July, the St. Charles hydrocracker experienced a smooth and successful startup and is now running at planned rates.","As a reminder, both of these hydrocrackers were designed to take advantage of the current environment of relatively high crude oil prices, strong diesel margins, and inexpensive natural gas. This is also consistent with our strategy to increase production of high quality diesel.","Also at the St. Charles refinery, the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture biofuels plant started up at the end of June. Throughout July we have been ramping up rates, this plant is designed to produce approximately 9,300 barrels per day of renewable diesel from low quality recycled cooking oils and fats using refinery hydro processing technology.","The project is a 50-50 joint venture between Valero and Darling International, a leading gatherer of used cooking oils and animal fats. Valero\u2019s retail segment reported $39 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2013 prior to the May 1 spin-off of CST Brands.","Subsequent to May 1, Valero reported its equity interest in the earnings of CST Brands as part of other income. As a result of entering into long-term fuel supply agreements, CST Brands became our largest wholesale customers. Our ethanol segment reported operating income of $95 million in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $90 million from the second quarter of 2012 mainly due to higher gross margins per gallon and higher production volumes.","Production averaged 3.5 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2013 for an increase of 156,000 gallons per day compared to the second quarter of 2012. The increase in production volumes was mainly due to the economic incentive of higher gross margins per gallon.","In the second quarter of 2013, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $233 million. Included in this were pretax charges of $52 million or $34 million after taxes for increases to environmental reserves related to non-operating sites and legal reserves and pretax charges of $30 million or $20 million after taxes related to cost incurred to affect the spin-off of CST Brands.","In the second quarter of 2013 net interest expense was $78 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense was $405 million and the effective tax rate was 37%. Regarding cash flows in the second quarter of 2013, capital expenditures were $796 million including $162 million for turnarounds and catalysts.","We returned $364 million in cash to our stockholders by paying $109 million in dividends and by purchasing 6.5 million shares of Valero common stock for $255 million. In addition, Valero paid off $300 million worth of 4.75% notes that matured in June and we received approximately $550 million of net cash from the CST Brands transaction.","At the end of the second quarter of 2013, we had approximately $3 million remaining under our stock purchase authorizations. With respect to our balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, cash was $2.4 billion, total debt was $6.6 billion, our debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 18.8% and we had over $6 billion of availability liquidity in addition to cash.","We maintain our guidance for full-year 2013 capital expenditures of approximately $2.85 billion which includes turnarounds and catalysts. For 2014, we estimate capital spending including catalysts and turnarounds to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Returning cash to stockholders remain a high priority and we are balancing this with opportunities to create value by strategically investing in logistics assets, hydrocracking, petrochemicals, and processing cost advantage lighter crude oil.","Our premise is to capture the competitive advantages provided by the growing supply of cost advantage crude oil and natural gas in the U.S. and Canada. Along these lines we are also evaluating potential petrochemical investments that will leverage our existing assets to upgrade the value of abundant and growing supplies of natural gas and natural gas liquids.","Lastly, we are evaluating the formation of a master limited partnership for our logistic assets. If for modeling our third-quarter operations, we should expect refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges; U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.5 million barrels to 1.55 million barrels per day; the U.S. mid-continent at 420,000 barrels to 440,000 barrels per day; the U.S. West Coast at 270,000 barrels to 280,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 470,000 to 490,000 barrels per day.","We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be around $3.85 per barrel. For our ethanol operations in the third quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.45 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization. Also in the third quarter we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation to be around $160 million and net interest expense should be about $100 million.","Total depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter should be around $420 million and our effective tax rate in the third quarter should be approximately 35%.","Okay, the rest that we have concluded our opening remarks, we will now open the call to questions. During this segment we request that our callers limit each turn in the queue to two questions. After those two questions callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Good morning.","Joe Gorder","","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Sure, they\u2019ll probably be a long list of these, but I wanted to start with RINs and one of the struggles I am going through is, our blenders passing through the cost of rents into the retail prices, does it vary by region, what are the major considerations with regard to whether or not these RINs cost are getting passed through to the retail well?","Joe Gorder","Well Jeff, this is Joe. I mean, it\u2019s a great question. We\u2019re trying to figure the same thing on ourselves. And I would tell you that we look at it on a regular basis and it\u2019s very difficult to quantify whether or not we are seeing the effect of the RINs in the cracks. ","We think we might be able, but we\u2019re not 100% sure. I do know that if you look at our customers, there are some out there that are able to capture this and there is some that aren\u2019t and everybody is interested in somehow capturing this and the real question for us going forward is, how much of this actually gets pass through into the marketplace and how much doesn\u2019t because it\u2019s a legitimate expense for us as we have mentioned $600 million to $800 million, it\u2019s a big hit and we\u2019d like to be recapturing it, we\u2019re just not sure whether we are or not.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","There has been press reports that have talked about blenders in the Gulf Coast reducing the price of blended gasoline in order to try to shift more gasoline sales through the blended stream rather than selling all RBOB and perhaps in the colonial pipeline and then it gets blended up in the Northeast. Have you seen evidence of this activity on the Gulf Coast? I guest the risk is, if you discount your blended gasoline, you loose the value on your traditional gasoline blended sales and I don\u2019t know how much you might be able to shift over from RBOB sales to blended sales?","Mike Ciskowski","","This is Ciskowski. I\u2019m trying to get a handle on this issue, it\u2019s obviously very difficult. Joe gave you a couple of our perceptions as to the market and our estimate of costs. I guess I need to remind you that we\u2019re no longer in the retail business. So we're not focused on the street that CST Brands and our other operations. So we're a wholesaler.","Valero is obviously trying to pass the tool where we can. We're obviously trying to recapture it where we can. Our opinion is we\u2019re getting some of it in the crack, but we're not getting all of it and now we can have a debate whether we\u2019re getting 50%, 25%, but we think we're getting some in the crack, but not all of it. And then, but having said all that Valero is going to maintain a competitive or be competitive to our wholesale branded customers where we capture the risk. And we will stay competitive and as if in fact the street and these other people are taking it on the street. We\u2019re going to be competitive to our customers \u2013 for our customers.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Thanks, Bill. Thanks, Jim.","Bill Klesse","","Thanks, Jeff.","","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Hey, good morning guys.","Bill Klesse","","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","First question just to follow up to kind of keep the RIN conversation moving. I know Bill, you've been front center in the RIN conversation and I read portions of your testimony in Washington last week. My question is, as you run your system do you make operating decisions based upon a fully loaded kind of RIN economic analysis of each asset. So the question is, would Valero or the industry potentially see economically induced RIN cuts based upon RIN cost and margins et cetera, particularly as you move into the seasonally weaker fourth quarter?","Bill Klesse","","So that\u2019s a perspective question. Today, with the gasoline cracks where they are at the peak of the gasoline season, and we are primarily talking about gasoline.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yep.","Bill Klesse","Then I would say that you are not seeing it, because we have good cracks. But the part of that question was, do we include that in our economics, and the answer is yes. And so, as we look down the road, end of the fourth quarter I don\u2019t know what the world will look like, but it is turning into a cost to manufacture for our company, certainly for the independent refining segment of the industry.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And for second question on CapEx, I know this is the first time you\u2019re providing 2014 CapEx, which looks flat, [ex-] CST to 2013. Can you discuss how you think about overall CapEx levels, the new project returns versus potential share buyback and I guess this will be outside of MLP-able assets?","Bill Klesse","Well our goals continue to be, as I\u2019ve stated over the years, we\u2019re going to maintain a safe operation. We\u2019re going to maintain our investment grade rating. We\u2019re going to hold a little more cash. These are the things that I have continually said. We are investing in reliability. We think in this world you have to be reliable. So what the company can do to support our people in the refineries by investment we\u2019re doing.","But then, this is a long-term capital investment business. And the marketplace has given us these opportunities because I know people are questioning methanol and you see some comments on petrochemicals. So the marketplace has given us this, given us lot of natural gas, giving us the potential from very inexpensive butanes, which obviously can be converted to gasoline, and Valero has the wherewithal, the expertise, the talented people to be able to construct and operate these type of plants. We have sustainable competitive advantages by extensions and bolt-ons to our existing assets and these are sustainable.","So [I\u2019m] getting to be an old guy and I look at what management does, and I think part of management\u2019s job is to take our cash flow and look at our alternatives. Do we have projects that will give our shareholders value, growth, over the long-term, and if we do and we look at our stock and how we think our stock is priced, but if we do have these, then we should presume for our shareholder, and if we don\u2019t, we return cash.","I think this management team has done a very good job at this, frankly. Over the years we bought a lot of our stock. There was a lot of stock issued in the acquisition period of Valero\u2019s history and we\u2019ve bought a lot of stock back over the years.","We raised our dividend. We got caught by the Great Recession just like a lot of people and had to regroup. But once we got past 2009 and 2010, we\u2019ve gotten back on the same path we were on before of returning cash to the shareholder.","We do continue to think our stock is inexpensive and we know that many of our shareholders are looking for yield anywhere they can get it. But we do think the marketplace has given us some opportunities.","So, we match it all up. We bought in the last 2.5 years 41 million shares. We spent about $1.2 billion around share repurchases. I\u2019ll probably get criticized from a few guys because some of those shares we brought at high year prices. We raised our dividend numerous times, and I\u2019ve made comments to the investment community that when we have the hydrocrackers done, management will look at the dividend and make a recommendation to our Board. So we\u2019ve done that.","Methanol has, actually it\u2019s gotten some feedback from some of you that are questioning that. Well, Valero is very uniquely positioned at our St. Charles refinery. We have a lot of hydrogen production capability. We can pull this syngas of these plants. We can build on ethanol plant for half of what the grassroots methanol plant can be built (inaudible) and with all the hydrogen capability of our own plants and third parties, we think we have an opportunity here to add significant shareholder value.","So I feel strongly that this is our job and whether this or alkylation or adding some crude capacities around light sweet crudes, which we don\u2019t have at some of our plants. We certainly don\u2019t want to be buying feedstocks when I am absolutely certain. The light sweet crude is going to be very long on the Gulf Coast. These are the type of jobs I think that are clearly in our shareholders interest, but it has to be a long-term thought process because basically just about anything we are doing anymore with permitting and it now takes us four to five years. So that\u2019s kind of how we look at it.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","It\u2019s really helpful. If I just, a quick follow-up and I\u2019ll leave it there. Within 2014, I guess for CapEx, I mean the categories are spending similar to 2013 in terms of growth versus maintenance and your MLP-able EBITDA growth rate if you will?","Joe Gorder","","Yes, because some of those projects we\u2019re talking about, we won\u2019t spent that much anyway. We get the railcars coming in, the logistics is still. All those projects are still significant part of that spending as next year.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Kessler from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., LLC","","Hi. Good morning, guys. Two questions for me on transportation economics and logistics assets, one on barge traffic. Your recent presentation highlighted 20,000 barrels a day to 30,000 barrels a day in barge deliveries in the Gulf Coast. I\u2019m curious if you have any more color on the pace of increase there and from where and to where you\u2019re moving? Presumably you are moving kind of west to east. But I\u2019m curious if the volumes have picked up and what you are seeing in the market for barges on the coast, are you getting into a tight market situation there? And then, I\u2019ve got a question about railcars as well.","Joe Gorder","","Yeah, Rob, this is Joe. I mean, our barge volumes have been pretty consistent. I\u2019d say if you look at everything, we are moving probably 90,000 barrels a day. We barge sweet crude into Houston. We barge sweet crude into Meraux, Memphis, receives Bakken. It will come up from St. James from barge periodically. St. Charles is receiving Cold Lake or they can heavy sour from higher crude down there and then we have a little bit of barge volume around corporate. So the major change there as far as our volumes go, okay. That\u2019s all I have there, so.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., LLC","Okay. Yeah, thanks for that. And if you wanted to pickup additional barges say in the spot market, your senses that would be available for you?","Bill Klesse","Yeah, I think in the spot market, it is a snug market, okay. I mean barges are being highly utilized and Jones Act vessels, which you could move products for crude on are very tight, and the prices have gone up on those. So there is not an abundant supply, but what we are seeing is and hearing from the barging companies is they have got so many barges under construction that we are going to find ourselves inadequate supply going forward.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., LLC","Okay, thanks for that. And then on the railcars, obviously the changing dynamics of this spreads of light has let\u2019s say, marginalized railcar transportation economics in the short-term, and just putting that in context with your capital program, you have previously stated plans for significant expenditures on railcar purchases, I think in fact that 850 million, it\u2019s the single largest of the spinning bucket you have outlined in your investor presentations, and I know that that\u2019s for optionality in feedstock in the like, but it sort of brings a question about the possibility of marginalized railcars sitting idle in the portfolio down the road. How do you think about that potential scenario in your overall capital budgeting process?","Bill Klesse","Well, there are two things I would say. You are right. The volume has come off and a lot of it has to do with what we have seen with WTI coming in so tight and that\u2019s affected it, that\u2019s going to vary. And we expect that discount will open up again. So the thing that we give with railcars is, you get tremendous optionality and where you move volumes and we are railing, we are actually railing now some bitumen down to Port Arthur, and that wasn\u2019t in our plan, but we have been able to get that and we are taking it across at commercial drop down or a commercial terminal down there.","If we look out a little bit longer-term, Valero has over 6,000 railcars that we currently lease. We use them to move asphalt, we use them to move LPGs, what we\u2019re adding to our fleets, worst-case scenario, we would go ahead and displace these leased railcars and use the ones that we purchased.","So we still feel good about our decision to go ahead and get these cars. I guess the fact that we have leased cars provides us a hedge on the downside, but we fully expected as these markets go back to a more normal pricing, which we expect WTI discount to go back out to $7 relative to the Gulf Coast, Bakken open up again, and I think we are going to see more normal discounts, which will put the railcars right back in the market.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., LLC","Understood, thanks Joe.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Doug Terreson from ISI.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Good morning everybody.","Ashley Smith","Good morning Doug.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Bill, returning to your comments few minutes ago about your meetings with Congress last week, and specifically on the renewable fuel standard, I wanted to see if you would comment on whether you feel that the industry is making progress in this area, and having its position understood, and any of the guidance for consumers, and also any updated opinion that you may have on whether changes might be ahead in this area, and also what you think there might be, just kind of a progress update on where we are headed with this?","Bill Klesse","Well, I think everyone on the call understands the RINs issue, and your assumptions when the 2005 and then the 2007 law were passed are very different today than before. The issue boils down to just a few things cellulosic is not available. That is not on the EPA's website, everyone says there is going to be a little cellulosic production this year, but it's totally uneconomic as well. I think it was clearly, let's pass the law and they will come, and it hasn't happened.","The other part of the regulation that is clearly you pass part of this advanced biofuels in the sense of the ethanol fees and this, so you get cellulosic. Then the other part of it is, it encourages you or you have to buy Brazilian sugarcane ethanol or somebody sugarcane ethanol. We have a law that encourages you to import over producing domestically.","And then on top of all of this, gasoline demand has not continued to grow. It's actually down and now flat. So the whole thing is screwed up and that's why, I said the other day it needs to be redone. And I'm supporting the industry position. I accept that. It needs to be done, redone because Valero is a little bit unique, and that we are a significant ethanol producer and we are also a significant renewable diesel producer. So we think E-10 is part of the fuel mix.","We think E-85 is part of the fuel mix. We have no issues with renewable or bio-diesel. We think that's all fine. Some of this technology is pretty damn good. But the EPA solution of going to E-15 is not practical. There are no facilities. Even the service station people are saying they don't know about their tanks and lines. That is no, hardly any certified pumps and you have the car warranties. I understand some of the 2013 car warranties saying, it's okay, but there is a whole lot of culprits out there besides this. So the whole thing needs to be redone.","The whole thing is basically with RINs is now, as I got quoted everywhere, it is out of control. RINs were in the preamble of the EPA\u2019s regulations that they were not going to be significant. They were there to give the industry flexibility and they give the EPA a way to monitor and now it\u2019s become a huge issue and so it just needs to be completely redone.","So where do I think, it\u2019s going? Well, the EPA doesn\u2019t seem to be able to do anything, and so it\u2019s a White House or Congress conversation, and the only way the White House will move is they get enough political pressure frankly from consumers, because at the end of the day, the consumer is going to pay for this.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","All right.","Bill Klesse","And they get enough pressure from consumers or the option that you see happening, and there will be some bills introduced here is over in Congress and the House and in the Senate, where people are at least understanding that this, the basis of the law are not appropriate anymore, yet there will be some compromise, so I am optimistic.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay.","Bill Klesse","That we are going to get something out of Congress and then the President will have to make a decision that is it backtracking or is it just fixing a problem. The earlier question is the realty, this is very unfair in the street, because you have winners and losers at retail and clearly in the refining segment, this is hurting the independent refiner, it is not hurting the majors. So you are actually hurting the independent guys. And it's that what you really want to happen, so I think we will get some congressional action, but I am not sure you're going to see anything this year.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","Okay, and then on methanol, I mean the outlook for that business is pretty positive for the next several years. And you\u2019ve talked about some of the rationale for the new plant, but I want to see if you elaborate on the competitive advantages, and the synergies that you referred to with some of your existing operations? And also what you guys plan to do with the product once you manufacture, I\u2019ll recognize that it\u2019s a way down. But if you can just kind of cover those that would be great?","Bill Klesse","So now you're jumping from the ethanol business to the petrochemicals?","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","I am.","Joe Gorder","","Ethanol to methanol?","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","","Yes.","Bill Klesse","","Yeah, from ethanol and methanol, okay. Because we think on ethanol, we just think it is fuel mix and we think we have a decent business there. And our people are doing a fine job. So I remember the old saying because renewable fuel, old saying, the renewable fuels association, 'Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered'. We got a good business there and everybody corn prices are up, farmland is up, it's part of the mix, it's accepted by the consumer, so I think some balance needs to get worked into this.","On methanol, because we have our own hydrogen plants at St. Charles, we are able to strip the sun gas before we finish and make hydrogen. We can take this sun gas, so we really don't have to build the front-end of methanol plant.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","All right.","Bill Klesse","And because there is a lot of supply capability and additional capability from an individual plan, when you look at the whole steam sink everything that you have around this. This is why I am saying we think that we will be able to build those plants for about half of what the grassroots plant 60% of the grass-roots plant.","The other thing is we used to be in this business. We\u2019re in a joint venture down in Houston. We had managed our shutdown when natural gas prices were going up. Obviously it was part of the MTBE business as well and use methanol to do that. But methanol is a way to move methane in a liquid from, if you think about it. And so, we just think it\u2019s a nice little bolt-on and we\u2019ll develop it little further. But we felt it\u2019s important to get it added into our marketplace, and Valero was looking at this.","Doug T. Terreson \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe this is for Joe or may be this is for Bill. Bill, I was looking at, I\u2019m trying to understand between the difference in the ethanol business, how you invoice your customer and in terms of, say, in the reformulated gasoline, when you invoice it you will have, say, what is your charge for the alkaline and what do you charge for ethanol as the price, Bill?","If then we really plan that much different that we can\u2019t move into the same system related to RIN. I mean that you could have two invoice if your customer want to buy the coupon reformulated gasoline including ethanol. So you will have to invoice that with the (inaudible) and then also separate item as ethanol. If they just want to buy the niche gasoline with alcohol, with our ethanol, so you have that and then you have a charge off the RIN given that every single refiner who sell to someone with our ethanol have to pay for that RIN. ","It seems now it\u2019s just part of the parcel, possible yet. By doing in this way you have the benefit to crystallize and make it very transparent, what the consumer ultimately is paying for then, and as we say, Congress is not going to do anything until that they get the topic outlined from consumer, and perhaps we will help the process. And secondly that is also making, I think that water usage so that we'd don't get confused that these investment community that how much is being possible or not possible? So, if there are any hurdle or obstacle \u2013 why the industry and including you guys as the leader why not moving into that","Bill Klesse","Well, I will let Joe and Gene add to this, but remember when you blend, that's when you can separate the RIN, theoretically the RIN has no value till you blend it. Now it all of a sudden the value, and because we can't get \u2013 if you don't count the carryover from 12, because you can't get to the mandated volume, you\u2019re short of RINs in the market. So you are just short. Now I understand you're asking about a whole pricing mechanism here, but RINs have taken on the life of their own, they are a market in and of themselves now.","And then at the rack, you have to be competitive. We sell ethanol at the market price, we sell gasoline at the market price, and so if the whole industry moves to some different pricing relationships, I'm sure you're correct, but unless the industry moves you can\u2019t capture it.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","That seems \u2013 yes, exactly what happened in 2005-2006, when we start moving into the ethane, there is a lot of confusion and you will never would expect to go ethanol, it\u2019s a separate item in the invoice. But by 2009, I think the only industry moved, I\u2019m just curious that you said anything stopping because everyone selling to their customer without the attachment of ethanol need to recuperating. So it seems like that is also fair because the stand that the guy that were buying the fuel, reformulated gasoline and they don\u2019t pay for the RIN?","Joe Gorder","Yeah, I mean Paul, Bill answered it I think correctly.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","","You guys have an answer to this?","Joe Gorder","No, I don\u2019t have.","Bill Klesse","","It\u2019s a competitive process and if you try to keep the RIN and other suppliers that\u2019s in the terminal is going to give the RIN to the customer, you are uncompetitive, so it\u2019s all got to balance out, it\u2019s a very fungible market out there, whether it would be the spot level or ethanol level.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","No. I understand that. What I am saying is that, you\u2019re making it crystalline and transparent for everyone to see and to know that what is that priced at they are paying and so we don\u2019t have the confusion.","Mike Ciskowski","Well, I think it\u2019s something we can kick around Paul, clearly we are just not there yet and we got to think through what the competitive implications are.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","All right. On my second question then, can you just give that the $2.5 billion, $3 billion for next year for the CapEx, is that new norm for the Company going forward, and at least for the next several years. I mean I think last year that we have been talking $1 billion, $2 billion, $2.5 billion, so is that now changed into this $2.5 billion and $3 billion and if that\u2019s the case how is that impacting in terms of your outlook on raising your recurrent dividend payout?","Mike Ciskowski","Well, I have never given longer term guidance than about two years out, I have said and I have thought 2014 would be in the $2.5 billion range previously and all we have done here is say, hey, it\u2019s $2.5 billion to $3 billion. So to me, we\u2019re still in the range, we are still in our budgeting for next year.","So whether it is the new norm or not, I don\u2019t know, I think it depends on whether or not we believe we will add value through some of these discretionary projects. I have said several times that our stay-in business, when I call the whole making an agenda to business, turnaround, regulatory, all of that seems to run somewhere in the $1.6 billion to $2 billion range. And then on top of that we add this discretionary area. But your main question is, it's bout returning cash to the shareholder and I think that if we have projects that add greater value, we're going to presume and if we don't we're going to return the cash to the shareholder and I don't see that as one big change from what this management team has been doing.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning.","Joe Gorder","","Good morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess may be just to change the subject a little bit. Light-heavies obviously had an impact on Q2. Can you help us understand as we're looking at Q3 where if you measure by LLS, light-heavy spread is pretty attractive. If you measure it by Brent WTI not so much, kind of what you're seeing move out there and what do you think really will sort of drive the market here over the next or let's just say, through year-end in terms of the most important marker on the light side of that argument?","Joe Gorder","You mean which would be more important like a Brent or an LLS or TI?","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah and maybe how LLS fits in, in terms of driving the Gulf Coast market there.","Joe Gorder","Right, so Roger, if we think about what's happened in this quarter, we obviously we had Brent WTI coming in a material way. We saw LLS move out and get priced at a more significant premium to Brent. I mean a lot of that has to do with the simple fact that, if we ended up being shorter in the Gulf Coast on light sweet crudes, than perhaps the market anticipated. And we\u2019ve said all along that the pricing of sweet crudes in the Gulf is going to be dependent on the quantity of domestic crude that\u2019s there, and we saw that we did have a bit of short supply, and there is a host of reasons for it. I mean, we had Syncrude outages in Canada that reduced the volume.","We got BP Whiting still running light sweet crude, which has supported Bakken prices at Clearbrook. Bakken is pricing up in the field, that\u2019s an LLS plus transportation or adjusted for transportation, which is making it expensive. But it\u2019s expensive because it was in tight supply.","So I think as we look forward into the third and the fourth quarters of this year. We are going to have more takeaway capacity out of Cushing and out of the Permian is going to bring those barrels to the Gulf, okay. I think that you will see more volume coming on-stream and moving into Cushing, so the inventory droughts that we saw will probably stabilize here a little bit. And so what\u2019s that due to the overall crude markets, well, I think you\u2019re going to see the light sweets, I mean our view is that LLS will trade down, and we will trade at a discount to Brent.","Longer term I think we\u2019ll see the WTI spread back out to maybe a $6 to $8 discount. And I think we will see the medium sours will adjust and priced themselves into the refinery. And then we\u2019re getting some relief on the heavy sour discounts now, the Mexicans have adjusted the K factors aggressively as they can over the last several months, and they have adjusted a $1.90 and that will take affect on August 1, which will increase the discounts on the Maya, which effects of course all the other heavy sours.","So I think as we look at the, we saw all the discounts on crude come in, in the second quarter. I think we\u2019re going to see them start to move back out in the third and the fourth quarters.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And the unrelated second question, probably more for you, Bill, getting back to the CapEx versus dividend versus share repo evaluation, what are the rough returns you are looking for or what are the various ways you analyze what makes the most sense for Valero to do at a given moment in terms of investing in the methanol plant versus, say, a more aggressive share repo program or accelerated, maybe I should say rather than aggressive?","","Bill Klesse","Well, so many of these plants are bolt-ons or extensions of our business. Because you\u2019re capitalizing on the whole refinery that\u2019s already there, these returns all are north of 25%, on all of them. These are IRRs. So, and we get into a huge conversation here, what is our cost of equity and I\u2019ve even had it with a lot of you that are on the call, and so we look at it and we try to balance and what you\u2019ve really seen with his management team and I keep going back to this is we\u2019ve bought our shares every single year that we\u2019ve been of this as part of this management except 2009 and 2010. And the other component here is next year we only have $200 million of debt that matures and year after that we only have $500 million of debt that matures. So we also see that we have ample cash flow coming out as well.","So, I think some of these projects are very good returns. We look at that. We look at where our equity is priced. It\u2019s obviously down from where it was and don\u2019t forget we spot out for the shareholders of CST as well. So I think we\u2019re very shareholder focused here. The only caveat I really stick on is it\u2019s long-term. You got to think we\u2019re looking at long-term shareholder value, not tomorrow afternoon.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Bill Klesse","","And we want a dividend that sustains, that we can sustain.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So when you are looking at the share repos, not necessarily \u2013 it\u2019s more a free cash flow driven than it is a return analysis, summing in other words, you are not going to worry so much about the share price at a given moment as you are, that\u2019s part of what you are doing or is it more to within that?","Bill Klesse","That would be correct. Back couple of years ago, we made a decision. We weren\u2019t going to buy any refineries, because we thought they were too high priced and we turned around and had a very significant share repurchase. So, yes, we have free cash flow. We have enough cash where we said our cash position is solid. We are going to maintain this investment grade rating. Then, yes, we are going to return the cash to the shareholder.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, fellows. Good morning. Bill, maybe I could just change talk again a little bit to the MLP. I know you\u2019ve kind of suggested now that you are probably moving forward here, but you spoke to this $50 million to $100 million of EBITDA, but as we look through your presentation, but there was a fair amount of MLP related expenditures. So can you help us a little bit with how you see this scale about EBITDA ultimately and what the kind of timeline is to get there?","Bill Klesse","Well, we have said and I think this was 2012 assets kind of where we had $50 million to $100 million of EBITDA and that\u2019s probably the range of where we\u2019re looking to go out initially. And as, Mike Ciskowski running this project for us here and he tells many that getting everything done, this is probably a first quarter of 2014 projects subject to of course our Board. And then, so we\u2019re doing all of that.","Obviously we\u2019re adding a lot of projects, pipelines, railcars, terminal enhancements, so rail facilities to unload and all of these assets are MLP-able. What we have said is our focus would be in the sense of a terminaling and distribution MLP, because some people has asked us about other assets and we said, well, our focus is more there. But obviously we have put many more potential dropdowns going forward.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Then you want to be drawing in a number, Bill, but just to keep it contacts. Obviously you\u2019re spending about $1.7 billion over the next, it says five years in the presentation, but it is really five years or is that a little quicker than that?","Bill Klesse","","It will be quicker than that.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great stuff. We can figure it out from there. Last one from me though is to go back to the RIN question and it\u2019s really, just on your guidance that you gave for the full year. If I\u2019m not mistaken you\u2019d talked to the $500 million to $750 million before, but RIN prices were like $0.75. Now they\u2019re up 60% from there and you\u2019re barely above the top end of that range in your guidance. Can you help us understand why we\u2019re not getting kind of proratable impact and it sounds like there will not be a lot of change in your cost even though the RIN cost has doubled, and I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Bill Klesse","Well, part of it has to do with where we bought these RINs and our position in the whole process, plus there is assumptions in our numbers as to export volumes, how much we\u2019re capturing and all of that. So that\u2019s based in there as well. But this is the range that we\u2019re operating in now, $600 million to $800 million, but clearly if it\u2019s $1.50 a RIN, we\u2019re at the high end of the range. So, but we\u2019re only in July.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right, but what I\u2019m trying to figure out is that, your previous range where the high end was $750 million and the RIN price was $0.75. Now the RIN price is about $0.36 and your high end is only up $50 million. So why only such a modest increase?","Bill Klesse","Well, obviously at the high end, I had a range of [$0.04] I mean, I was probably at the low end. So I think you just have to accept that we\u2019re not misleading you. This is how we are viewing it. You guys are asking us for guidance and I\u2019m saying to you, okay, $1.36. I always use $1.48 or something, but these higher numbers will be at the high side of our range. It has to do with our position as to when we bought a lot of these. So there is a serious timing component and volunteer.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So this is for 2013. Does it change the markets in 2014? Does it change significantly?","Bill Klesse","Absolutely, it will change. Remember when we first started this, they were $0.75, and in January or February they were still $0.05 and then they started moving up. They went to $1. They pulled back to $0.60, $0.70. Then they got back. But next year it would be a much larger number at $1.50 a RIN.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Right.","Bill Klesse","We\u2019ll get into the conversation, well, how much a RIN is going to be in 2014, because you\u2019re totally unfeasible.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there, Bill.","Bill Klesse","No, seriously because you have the carryover from 2012. So that\u2019s the big debate this year, but you\u2019re going to have to carry from 2013 into 2014. You can carry in 20%, but there are going to be enough rooms around. So all the way it\u2019s totally not feasible next year.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, Bill. Thanks a lot. Appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. The question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Bill Klesse","Hello, Paul.","Joe Gorder","","Good morning, Paul.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Howdy. Thanks, well, for the CapEx guidance, early CapEx guidance. We appreciate that. Bill, you mentioned really part of my question, which was the $1.6 billion to $2 billion that you have the ongoing stay-in business CapEx.","Bill Klesse","So our DD&A is running on about $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, at $1.7 billion, and I think it\u2019s very unrealistic to assume we don\u2019t have to spend DD&A or maintain our assets.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Let\u2019s see. I mean effectively one way of looking at this has even effectively doubled your growth CapEx at the margin, but we\u2019re coming of two huge projects in the past year or so that have come online. I\u2019m just wondering what the components are of the new relatively high number for growth CapEx. Could you list the biggest on several projects that you\u2019re going to be investing in? Thanks.","Joe Gorder","","Yeah, Paul, the best guidance we can provide right now about those details would be on slide 19 of our latest IR presentation, which we presented earlier this month and that\u2019s focused on 2013, but the 2014 details are largely in line with that. As we get later in 2013 and we complete our strategic planning process, we\u2019ll be able to hung that and give you the specific chunks, but it\u2019s very similar. We also have specific continuation of spending on existing processes or existing projects. And keep in mind, as Bill said earlier, they\u2019re long-term projects. I know it takes you guys a second to update your model, but it actually take years to get permit and construction and do all these things and to spend the money.","So, in order to achieve the returns Bill talked about earlier, it does take some time and that\u2019s why there\u2019s generally going to be continuation of existing projects.","Bill Klesse","","And then on slide 32, in that same hand out we gave a little EBITDAs with some of the projects as well, okay. So if you can teach together how we\u2019re looking at them.","Joe Gorder","","We\u2019ll update that later this year as we go through our planning process and complete that.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I think that you\u2019re referring to Deutsche Bank models. By the way they\u2019re actually with Deutsche \u2013 you\u2019re looking for from a planning. So thinking about how you decide on these investments, I\u2019m looking at your cash flows that are low in 2009 of little bit under $2 billion, maybe last year $5 billion. Is that how we think about it, and we\u2019ve been asking this question in various ways on this call obviously, but I\u2019m just wondering another way of looking at this is that you\u2019ve doubled your \u2013 effectively doubled your growth CapEx to the margin against the expectations. You could have effectively doubled your free cash flow, especially in a high risk RINs environment. I\u2019m just trying to drill down into why you\u2019re spending so much money basically. Thanks.","Bill Klesse","","Well, if you look at the logistics capital, it's kind of being intact, so in place and I'll just try to add clarity here the place where I'm sure some of you guys are wrestling with is in this whole petrochemical methanol area, and our view is that the marketplace is giving companies like us a huge opportunity that add a lot of value for our shareholder. We expect low cost natural gas, that's why the hydrocrackers looks so good.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. For the years, you are assuming Bill that $4?","Bill Klesse","","No, that\u2019s up $5. We think the number needs to be a little higher long-term, so that the drilling industry can make a reasonable return. There seems to be a debate sub four, how much return you\u2019re getting, but if you get into the $5 range, we believe they can make a return, no. You guys would know more about that I suppose than us.","But then you look at the butane is coming, here we have alkylation units within our refineries right now. These things just look like something where Valero and its shareholders can really benefit.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah I get.","Bill Klesse","So we\u2019re studying it and we're getting it out there, so at least you guys know these are the things that we are looking at.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Can you give us a sense of how much more light sweet crude you think you will be able to run, let's say, by the end of 14?","Bill Klesse","Yeah, well, actually can, because we our projects weren\u2019t quite be done.","Mike Ciskowski","Yeah, by 14 not a whole lot more, it's not till these the toppers have done in early 2015 that would be able to increase those. And those I think\u2026","Bill Klesse","Go back and 14.","Mike Ciskowski","Yeah but if you\u2019re really talking \u2013 it\u2019s not until 2015 conversation. But if you take the Houston plant, it is 70, down in Corpus it\u2019s 90, we\u2019re looking at Port Arthur where we have a ideal crude tower. Our excess crude tower in excess basin tower is probably 50,000 to 75,000 and we\u2019re something \u2013 Quebec is already a sweet crude refinery but we\u2019ll be subbing in North American crude more and more as we go through time. And then at Meraux, we\u2019ll be running more liner crude there as well. So (inaudible) price et cetera significant, then we have these little change or add this deal here and repipe this project that\u2019s going on too. But as you \u2013 he\u2019ll give you numbers.","Joe Gorder","","It\u2019s 160,000 barrels a day.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","For those two?","Joe Gorder","","For those two.","Bill Klesse","","My counting then the other one that I just said, so we\u2019ll pick up another 50 to 100 to Port Arthur and Meraux.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Okay. So in closing from me, end 2015, how much more slight sweet would be if you like a substitution and how much more would be incremental throughput in what throttle. And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Bill Klesse","Some with all the incremental throughput, so as incremental throughput backing others our feedstock purchases. So remember we buy Algerian Resides, a lot of those that we bring directly into our units, we bring some other of these feedstocks in that basically go to the cads and instead we\u2019ll be making a lot of our own gas oil.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","","Okay. Is all incremental replacement, a bit confused? Is the (inaudible) capacity is higher or lower?","Bill Klesse","","The overall crude capacity will be higher per share.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I know that.","Bill Klesse","Not our throughput capacity.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got you. Okay. That's great. And so...","Bill Klesse","Remember we run today, I guess officially we'd say we're 2.3 million barrels to 2.4 million barrels a day of crude, but we\u2019re 2.8 million barrels to 2.9 million barrels of throughput, because we're buying these other items.","Paul B. Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. And I don't want to take up the whole call, but that's very helpful, and I will come back potentially with more. Thanks a lot.","Bill Klesse","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, and sorry for another follow-up on the RINs, but if you look at the 2014 and I agree with your comments and how unworkable the RFS looks, can you talk about to what degree you guys can crack up your exports to help offset some of your RIN obligation next year relative to what you might be doing this year?","","Bill Klesse","","Well, it depends on the cost of the RIN. So you have to have a basic crack. So sooner we'll have a basic crack that says, hey, it's profitable to make those barrels. Then you have if RINs are $1.50, technically you have $0.15 a gallon here that you're playing around with. So you can be very competitive going in export versus the U.S. market, as far as ramping up.","Joe Gorder","Ramping up the exports.","Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","I mean if the industry is basically out of RINs next year and you guys are on the coast who do have export capability, I mean again Congress is going to have to take actions at some point here, but in the absence of that it seems like you could have a very, very high RIN price well above where you are today.","No one wants to shut in their unit, which I guess is the other way to not have a RIN obligation, it would seem like exports is one of the outlets and you guys would seem to have the better position to do that, but just trying to kind of see if we can frame how much you could reduce your volume metric RIN obligation next year, if it\u2019s whatever the right phasing is very, very high RIN price, much higher than where we are right now.","Joe Gorder","All right, so Arjun, let\u2019s assume that the markets out there for the barrels to be exported, okay, and as the Arabs support the exporting and just as an example, we exported 70,000 barrels a day of gasoline. In the second quarter we exported 170,000 barrels a day of diesel. Now those numbers are what they are because we optimize the supply into the marketplace. We had a very strong market to add to because, yeah, Joliet turnaround, and Whiting turnaround, I think we\u2019re down and so we\u2019re able to move barrels to that higher market.","Barring that and saying that the market was demanding the barrels abroad, we could go to 225,000 barrels a day of gasoline and 280,000 barrels a day of diesel and then the projects that we\u2019ve gotten underway to improve docks and tankage and segregations at the refineries would allow us to take it up beyond that going forward, particularly with the same trial hydrocarbon coming on and the quality of the diesel fuels that we\u2019re getting out of St. Charles and Port Arthur. So there is capacity.","Bill Klesse","","I think Joe is giving you a capacity conversation and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic because the industry is in the same boat and so yes, we are on the Gulf Coast and we have that capability, but so like other people and you get down to the basic, you got to have the basic racks. So yes, the way you\u2019ve phrased your question, Joe answered you, yeah, we would have capability. Yes, we are on the Gulf Coast, so we could do that, but I would not want lead you down a path that this would be a significant solution for us. I don\u2019t think so.","Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate, yeah, go ahead.","Gene Edwards","It\u2019s Gene, I would just add to those that both of these solutions there, exporting more ore reducing refinery runs, reduce supply, so to Maya really doesn\u2019t go down, which we don\u2019t think in the next year. We got to meet demand, but still to me it\u2019s definitely got new price in the cracks on the U.S. basis and maybe lower basis for exported barrels.","Arjun N. Murti \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","No. That to me would be the mechanism right by which you then get the true pass through, especially if the U.S. economy recovery and the demand is there, do you guys either supply less, which I don\u2019t think you do, but potentially export more, it\u2019s clearly a mechanism to get the pass through, but I appreciate your counter and the answer, thank you so much.","Operator","The next question is from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hey good morning, yeah there are obviously a lot going on in refining, lots of questions. I guess the 2Q Gulf Coast was probably the weakest absolute number that we\u2019ve seen for a long time. I guess despite the first hydrocracker, and that\u2019s also despite, there is some cheap Eagle Ford coming into the Corpus. Clearly light heavy is weak, but is there anything else material going on that we should focus on, and I guess if not and it\u2019s like heavy expands again overtime, you should go back to a more normal capture?","Ashley Smith","Yeah, that\u2019s it. I mean, when you are referring to light-heavy either you are talking about really kind of the sour crudes versus the sweeter crudes in general?","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Yes.","Ashley Smith","Because, they were \u2013 you are right. The discounts at all of those crudes relative to the sweet crudes were off and we should just like, we ran about the same amount of heavy sour crude. Core Q2 2012 versus Q2 2013, we ran quite a lot less medium sour though, because it tended to be just out of the market. Now, on the heavy sour side, we don\u2019t provide all of our heavy sour for example, Maya so we had some advantages there. But I don\u2019t know of anything else overlaying, I don\u2019t know of anything else going on in the Gulf other than that.","Joe Gorder","Well, we make a lot of other products and they are all moving around, but if you take our poor relative refining which is a very (inaudible) Maya crude oils, it did very poorly in the second quarter.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay.","Joe Gorder","Even with its new hydrocracker.","Bill Klesse","Yeah, and that\u2026","Joe Gorder","Okay, due to the pricing of Maya. So you can see that have a huge impact.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And then a second question, more broader around the Texas market I guess, I mean you\u2019ve got the Eagle Ford growing some decent Permian well results. Recently you\u2019ve got two major pipelines probably more coming down into Texas. I mean, do you think there is a limit on the effective capacity of the industries to move those barrels over to Louisiana or earlier you spoke about there being enough barges, but it feels like there is a lot of volume and it could cause some stress, any color on that would be helpful.","Joe Gorder","Well, I think as the volume comes into Houston eventually here it\u2019s got to move east. And so you\u2019re going to have shales pipeline running, which have the very high tariff, which is a lot higher than barges. So I think you\u2019re going to see the barges, you\u2019re going to see assets come into play here. Of course it\u2019s got to move. It\u2019s got to move along the coasts, and one of our competitors have signed a deal to take to ship it up to the East Coast by water as well. And so you\u2019re going to see it moving and to us Houston is going to be the bulk of quite of all in this.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","And I mean in terms, I mean obviously does any limit how much light you can run I guess moves across, but as you talk to your major suppliers, I\u2019m thinking Mexicans obviously those mediums coming over from the Middle East. How do you think they're going to respond to the fact that not just yourselves, but the whole industry on the Gulf is going to probably looking for less of their products.","Bill Klesse","Well, it remains to be seen and there will be political considerations as well, because I mean Valero, we buy from the Persian Gulf suppliers. And they have a stake in this market, and their crude is more medium than this light that we are talking about, but this isn't today's issue and it\u2019s probably not tomorrows\u2019. This is probably a 2015, 2016 conversation, but over time the U.S. is going to have a lot more oil on the Gulf Coast than I think the refining industry got to figure out how to run it.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Thank you. That's very clear.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Faisel Kahn from Citigroup.","Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup","Hi, good morning, it's Faisel from Citi.","Ashley Smith","Hey Faisel.","Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup","Hey, Ashley. Just another ethanol question, I guess how difficult would it be for you guys to increase your blending capability, and I know you sell a certain amount of merchant volumes, and you blend some of your volumes, but how difficult will it be to increase your blending capability given your natural supply of ethanol here and your production of gasoline?","Joe Gorder","Well Faisel we are looking at increasing it everywhere we can as you would expect and for example, with the Diamond Green project, we're going to have a lot of renewable diesel that we can blend it to the pool. But we're looking at every asset we have, and if it requires some modest investment to increase the blending capabilities there, we're going to do it. And but generally said, I mean we just don\u2019t have access to the terminal assets to control blending up all the products that we produce. We are a merchant refiner, and we sell a lot at the plants of the refinery and we just don\u2019t have the opportunity to blend that up.","Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, understood.","Mike Ciskowski","So we are blending where we can and diesel side is what Joe is talking about more, because we have a customer base here.","Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup","Sure.","Mike Ciskowski","And the customer base goes into a terminal, I mean everybody sees I guess somebody said the $1.36 RIN. So I mean it\u2019s a matter of customers as well. So where we can we have added facilities where we are blending, but clearly the marketplace is in disarray because the wholesale racks theoretically anyway you got all these different prices now.","Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup","All right, fair enough.","Mike Ciskowski","We are trying to minimize, if the question is that you are trying to do things to minimize your exposure, the answer is absolutely.","Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, got it. And then just last question from me and the call is being going on for a while. On the potential investments in natural gas liquids and also alkylate sort of investments, can you talk a little bit and little more granularity and kind of where, what type of assets you are looking at building and where you are looking to doing that, is it fractionation and where would it be and also on the alkylate side, where are you looking to increase your production of alkylate?","Mike Ciskowski","Well, so it\u2019s not fractionation per se. We don\u2019t think I answered this on the last call, last April. I don\u2019t think we add value per se just to build the fractionator. But where Valero, we don\u2019t really have a competitive advantage over some of these guys like enterprise for instance, you can come in and build fractionator, but what we do, do is, we have alkylation units in all our refineries, alkylates are great blend stock. ","When you look at how we make gasoline, gasoline, gasoline\u2019s are Brent. If you remember that it\u2019s made up of all these different components, and so as we look at our system. We have, we believe we\u2019re going to very inexpensive butane subsequent to last, we have spend the last 10 years of our maybe 15 years of our careers, we\u2019re moving butanes from gasoline. And the one way you can stick butane back into gasoline is by alkylating it, or making a longer carbon chain.","And so, as we see normals coming and converting them to butylene and you see cheap or inexpensive isobutane. There is we just think this is a good option in a refinery to be able to increase that the amount of that blend stock.","Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup","It make sense within how, when where do you do that? And how are you, I mean what are the magnitude of investments, you make to kind of increase that capability?","Bill Klesse","Well these alkylate units would be $200 million, $300 million and all the sulfuric acid Valero would not build the new HF Alky and as we look at our system there would be on the Gulf Coast.","Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Bill Klesse","With one possible exception, for a different reason.","Faisel Kahn \u2013 Citigroup","Got it, thanks guys I appreciate the time.","Ashley Smith","Sure, thanks Faisel.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Great.","Bill Klesse","Hi, Chi Chow.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Hello, hi Bill. How are you doing? I think you noticed this, hey just sorry to keep pound as the main issue, but Mike, can you tell us how the accounting works on your RIN purchase and how exactly that flow to your P&L.","Mike Ciskowski","Our accounting is based on whatever our RINs deficit is and we amortize them. We purchase forward, we have been purchasing a number of contracts and we amortize that cost in as a deficit basically created.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","","Okay, great. And is that split by region as far as where that amortization goes in the cost of good.","Mike Ciskowski","From a regional standpoint, we allocate all of that based on throughput basis to the regions.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. So split in each region by throughput.","Mike Ciskowski","Correct.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. Got it. Thanks on that. And Bill, I just want to clarify, I think you mentioned on one of the other questions, the $600 million to $800 million on the 2013 cost, is that a net number net of some sort of pass through assumption?","Bill Klesse","No, that\u2019s not a net number. That\u2019s just what the deficit would cost us.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. Okay, good. Thanks for that. And I guess, final question on rail movements. How do you think this Quebec railcar accident is going to impact crude by rail going forward? Is they going to be more regulation costs? Any thoughts on that?","Mike Ciskowski","So this is Ciskowski. I don\u2019t think it will impact in the sense of the extremes. I do think that you\u2019re not going to see one person trains anymore. You are not going to see trains less sitting on the siding, full of products. I think it\u2019s just one of those areas that people just hadn\u2019t focused on and this is a very tragic accident and I mean, we all understand that.","So I think you're going to see more of the procedures. You\u2019re going to see a very strong review of procedures. I think you will see the cooperation increased in North America here between Canada and the U.S. on regulation on \u2013 maybe on tank car design. You will see more on these bonnets beeping them up. I think also you'll have a conversation that will pull the Mexicans into this as well. But rail and crude, railing ethanol, railing distillers grain, railing corn, railing asphalt, propanes, they're all here. They are part of the distribution system. But there will be procedural things that will change. I mean this train was left below. I don't think you're going to be leaving a train on the side with nobody there anymore.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Yeah. Sure. Not going forward.","Bill Klesse","But those kind of things will take a little time, but to me that's rare. We'll see more procedures and maybe it's in the operating area.","","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","You mentioned maybe changes in tank car design. Does that impact your deliveries at all going forward on your railcars?","Bill Klesse","That would not because there is no change in that, right?","","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Right.","Bill Klesse","","And then, if it is we operate a very \u2013 we strive all the time for safety and reliability and at some times we take a look at it.","","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","All right. Okay. Thanks, Bill. I appreciate it.","Bill Klesse","","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Allen Good from Morningstar.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research","Good morning. Just a question on the chemical investment follow-up. You mentioned some of the characteristics around St. Charles that made it attractive. When you look around your system, maybe what are some of the other opportunities you think for additional chemical investments. And if you do identify those, would you be willing to move forward with maybe several of these similar size investments at the same time.","Bill Klesse","Well it is a very fair question and we are looking at this because the market place is changing so quickly because I am of the belief that United States can have a huge manufacturing and petrochemical resurgence here, our government will figure out how to get behind. But we\u2019ve looked at the Gulf Coast plans, there are in the sense of our crown jewel assets. They give you access to the water, because some products would be exported. Remember Valero was already in the benching time with xylene business. We\u2019re already in the propylene business. So we\u2019re in a lot of these businesses anyway, and so we are just talking about (inaudible), but they\u2019d be along the Gulf Coast.","And would we take on several projects at the same time? Sure, we have the capability as the other companies do, they match projects in the capital spend level that we\u2019ve guided you.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research","Okay, thanks. And I guess the second question is, early you mentioned that you expect some of these crude differentials that have narrowed in the first half of the year to widen back out. Well, this year, looking at your most recent presentation you have small lift here of rail and barge projects that you anticipate to come online later this year moving, (inaudible) crude in the Gulf Coast, West Coast and North Atlanta region.","If we\u2019re at the same situation here as far as differentials are concerned, I guess mainly being the brand, as we get into the third and fourth quarter where it\u2019s basically no differential, would you still expect some of those rail projects to come on line and start delivering some of that crude via rail or would you delay that in the next year and to may be give some more widening into this spread?","Bill Klesse","Yeah, it would absolutely depend on some of our deals. But yeah, hey we\u2019re in business to make money and if it\u2019s not economic to do some, we may have some fees we have to pay a few guys, but and where we have to take it, well we\u2019ll have to do it, make the best of it. But we try very hard to maintain optionality on these deals. I\u2019m sure, if you don\u2019t have any spreads, you\u2019re going to optimize.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Is there really general, that we have Brent spread or any other source spread we could use just may be a rule of thumb to see whether there some of these rail projects in general are economical for you?","Mike Ciskowski","Well, in the back of our handout, we have that big map where we made this price call it 12 to 18 months and we said, New York Harbor is where we see the equilibrium point between Brent and delivered sweet crudes into the harbor. So you take Brent plus a couple of bucks for freight, and so we\u2019ve been saying that\u2019s where a lot of these balances run these costs. And then you back up from there, and so we think overtime, you\u2019re going to have these differentials, because the crudes got to move to the markets and it\u2019s got to displace the foreign barrels.","So \u2013 but sure you\u2019re going to have a spot month or two of what\u2019s going on right now, but we don\u2019t believe they\u2019re going to last. So we\u2019re in business for the long term.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Okay, great. Thanks.","Mike Ciskowski","In our appendix it\u2019s in there, we put all those numbers in there, and so I think we say 12 to 24 months is our price outlook. But the basis is the East Coast being equilibrium. So Gulf Coast, we think that LLS is several dollars below that.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Research","","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Just real quick question, Bill, I know that you may not want to give us an absolute number, but what is the percent of your rail arrangement with the rail operator, is I think will pay for the long-term or what percentage is that like 30 day roll over kind of deal?","Bill Klesse","I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s, I don\u2019t want to give it to you. I am not sure we know\u2026","Joe Gorder","No, we don\u2019t have\u2026","Bill Klesse","","I think we have loading fees. Well I think here we just, we\u2019ll give Ashley a couple, we\u2019ll gets and puts up together. The railroad, we own the cars, so Joe\u2019s point is, hey you don\u2019t have that. But the right reason I was hesitant on the previous question is we make some commitments the load cars at these third-party loadings at our own refineries, at our facilities, so there are no obligation. But we do have some fee commitments below then a couple of things like that, purchases of oil. So we will put some thing together, but it\u2019s very, it\u2019s relatively small, but we have a, once we get all our railcars, we will have a $750 million investment in railcars, and a couple other 100 million in sidings. So we want to return to.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Secondly that on the (inaudible) and also the Seaway one and two can you give us some rough idea there what is your (inaudible) commitment on those?","Joe Gorder","","Yeah, Paul, we don\u2019t do that.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Final one, Bill, when we\u2019re looking at your dividend policy when the Board [give out] whether you are going to increase or not, is there a policy from management that this is a annual exercise or it is a semi-annual or that\u2019s really no policy at all?","Bill Klesse","Well, I\u2019d like to \u2013 went away and phrase your question, no policy at all.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","No, I mean, you made\u2026","","Bill Klesse","I think we are little better than that. We\u2019ve raised our dividend in January and I said that we would look at it and management would have a recommendation. We have it at our Board meeting this month after we finish the hydrocrackers, but we will look at our balance. We\u2019ll look at our forecast. We\u2019ll look at our payout rate. I have said that Valero wants to be among the highest in dividends and returning cash to our shareholder of our peer group and so we look at those guys as well.","So I feel like there is more of a process, but we don\u2019t say the July Board Meeting is a dividend meeting. It is a dividend meeting with the Board, but we don\u2019t say management is going to raise the dividend or some at the January meeting or the April meeting or the July. We go into it with us having looked at our forecast where we think our cash is, do we think we can sustain it, and then we make a recommendation to the Board.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Ashley Smith","","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further question.","Ashley Smith","Okay. Thank you, Lorissa, and I just want to thank everyone for listening to our call today.

My name is Tiffany, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke. Mr. Locke, you may begin.","John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Tiffany. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are: Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in our press release. In summary it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Now I will turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks very much, John, and good morning, everyone.","As John will cover in more detail shortly, our team operated our system safely, reliably, and efficiently during the second quarter, allowing us to capture a very high percentage of the favorable margins available to us. In particular, we saw market conditions that incentivized maximum gasoline production in most regions.","As for our priorities, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to stockholders by exceeding our total payout guidance. As reflected in the earnings release, we've increased the targeted total payout ratio for 2015 to approximately 75% of net income.","We continue to advance the next dropdown transaction to Valero Energy Partners LP, which is our sponsored MLP. We've also completed our estimate of potential MLP-eligible EBITDA within our fuels distribution business. In that regard, we've identified approximately $350 million that may be eligible for dropdown transactions to VLP, which is incremental to the approximately $800 million of remaining EBITDA that we've previously identified.","And finally, in regard to the proposed methanol project at St. Charles, we plan to have a final investment decision by the end of the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our prior investments in hydrogen production capacity at the refinery provide us with a competitive advantage versus a greenfield methanol plant in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.","So with that, John, I'll hand it back over to you.","John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Great, thank you, Joe.","Now moving on to the quarterly results, we reported net income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion or $2.66 per share versus second quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.22. The refining segment reported operating income of $2.2 billion, notwithstanding planned turnaround work on the FCC [Fluid Catalytic Cracking] and alky [alkylation] units at our Port Arthur refinery.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which is an increase of 87,000 barrels per day versus the second quarter of 2014. Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the second quarter of 2015.","Refining cash operating expenses were $3.66 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015, or $0.24 per barrel lower than the second quarter of 2014. Lower energy costs, primarily due to lower natural gas prices and less planned and unplanned downtime, were the main drivers for the decrease.","The ethanol segment generated $108 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2015 versus $187 million in the second quarter of 2014. General and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $178 million in the second quarter of 2015. Also in the second quarter of 2015, net interest expense was $113 million, which is $15 million higher than in the second quarter of 2014, primarily due to the debt issuance in March of this year. Depreciation and amortization expense was $425 million. The effective tax rate was 30.8%.","With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $7.3 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.8 billion, of which $52 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was approximately 20%. Valero had over $5 billion of available liquidity excluding cash.","Cash flows in the second quarter included $530 million of capital spending, of which $160 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. We also repaid $75 million of debt that matured in June.","We returned $870 million in cash to our stockholders in the second quarter, which included $203 million in dividend payments and $667 million for the purchase of 11.3 million shares of Valero common stock. Year to date we've purchased 19.5 million shares for $1.2 billion.","For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.57 million to 1.62 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 445,000 to 465,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 275,000 to 295,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 475,000 to 495,000 barrels per day.","We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be around $3.75 per barrel.","Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.","We expect G&A expense excluding corporate depreciation for the third quarter to be around $180 million, and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $450 million. And our effective tax rate is expected to be around 33%.","Lastly, following the EPA's announcement of proposed RFS [Renewable Fuel Standards] targets in late May and the subsequent decline in Ethanol RINs [Renewable Identification Numbers] prices, we expect 2015 RINs expense to be between $350 million and $450 million.","Tiffany, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we will open the call to questions. During the Q&A, we ask that our callers please limit each turn to two questions. Callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions as time permits.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. And our first question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil, you may go ahead.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Neil.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Joe, we continue to see this tremendous bifurcation in the crack between gasoline and diesel. Is this the world that you envision here over the next couple months or even into 2016, where gasoline stays strong and diesel stays weak? And can you talk about the demand dynamics you're seeing from the product side between those two different categories?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet, Neil. It's probably best if Gary Simmons spoke to that. He's closest to the market.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Neil, I guess what I would say is we certainly expected some price demand elasticity for gasoline with the fall in flat price. And we've seen that, and we didn't really know exactly what the magnitude of the pent-up demand would be. And it's been a very pleasant surprise, and I think we do expect that that response will continue into the future.","Overall, you talk about diesel margins being weak. Really diesel margins are about where they've been historically. It's just mainly the strength in gasoline. We would see that there would be some seasonality. As we get out of driving season, we would certainly expect some fall-off in gasoline demand. But as long as we see the lower prices, I think we expect the demand response to continue to be good.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Very good. And then the follow-up here is on the methanol project. Maybe I'm over-interpreting the remarks here, but it sounds like you're more constructive on a possible project. Can you talk through the pluses and minuses associated with methanol and just remind us of some of the project economics?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, we'll let Lane talk to this and then we'll all add.","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Neil, this is Lane. Just as a reminder on the fundamentals of that project, it's really a natural gas-to-liquids project. And we still have a long view that natural gas is going to be advantaged going forward, and it is one of the most economical ways to get natural gas into the liquids, crude-related pricing environment. We did review all of the way up through Gate 3. The project still looks good. But as we've mentioned in all of our Investor Relations meetings, where we are now is trying to get the right deal with a partner to make this a good deal for our shareholders, and that's what we're working on currently. And we expect to have some resolution on that by the end of this year or early first quarter. What else was it?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that covers it. Neil, honestly, the project looks good and the guys have now identified what the capital might look like, and we're just working through the negotiations with a partner on what the transaction might look like. We consider having gas-to-liquids projects as good projects for us. We also consider that entering into what we would consider to a be a bit of a new line of business, it's always prudent to try to manage that risk and to look for opportunities not only to do a project like this but additional projects going forward. So again, we continue to advance it. I would tell you we feel pretty good about it. And if we can get the type of deal that we're looking for, I would suspect that we'd advance it.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Joe.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Paul, you may go ahead.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Joe, one of your competitors recently did a deal using the high-currency MLP vehicle to buy another MLP, and the end result for the C-Corp has been quite excellent. And last year the other competitor of yours did something similar. So I know that you guys have been focusing on the dropdown. But given the success from your competitor, is that something that you guys will reconsider, maybe shifting the strategy a bit here or that you're going to stick with dropdown?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Paul, I didn't see the transaction that you're talking about. I'm teasing you. But I think, look, we've seen two transactions now take place like this. Let me start by saying we clearly understand the value of the general partnership and we understand the value of pushing to the high splits.","That being said, we're very comfortable with the approach that we've taken thus far with our dropdowns. We'll execute the second dropdown transaction later this year, and I think that you could expect that going into next year that dropdowns will probably be accelerated somewhat further. But it's always a matter of opportunity and timing, and for us we don't believe that VLP currently is positioned to do a transaction similar to this on their own. They don't have their investment-grade rating. We're probably a year behind these others in getting an MLP into the marketplace. And so we believe that right now the most prudent thing to do is to execute the strategy that we've laid out, and then longer term we'll look for opportunities.","And obviously, these deals seem to be a double-edged sword. They do create significant value at the C-Corp, but they've also had a fairly questionable effect on the LP. And so in a perfect world, we could get a transaction that would benefit both, but right now our focus is on continuing to do the dropdowns.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, second question. Maybe this is for you or for Simmons. There seems to be a tightness in the alkylate or the high-octane component in the market today, and I just want to see whether you guys agree with that assessment. And secondly that if it is, how do you think the impact on the industry gasoline supply as well as the gasoline crack? Thank you.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Yes, Paul, so this is Gary. We certainly do see that all heavy octane components are trading at a significant premium. I think there are several driving factors here that are causing that to occur. One, you have a very wide spread between naphtha and gasoline, so that's incentivizing people to try to blend naphtha into the gasoline pool. In order to make that happen, you have to have a high octane blend component.","The second thing that's happened is there has been quite a bit of planned and unplanned maintenance on re-formers and Appalachian units throughout the industry. So some of it is supply-related. And then finally, some of these export markets, in particular Mexico, we're seeing a lot of good demand for Mexico for gasoline. And although the octane retirements in Mexico are comparable to what we have here in the U.S., they have an olefin spec on their gasoline, NPT and olefins, and that forces you to blend a lot more reformate and alkylate and less TET gasoline in order to sell your product into that market. So I think this is something that we see that will continue into the future.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Gary, can I ask a slightly somewhat different question? With the LLS mass discount we know with Maya is over $4 and LLS priced at $50, it seems like you guys must be printing money in processing the medium sour, and especially comparing to the Maya discount is not really attractive. So do you think that it will ultimately force the Maya discount to be wider now, or that you're actually going to see the mass discount narrow from here?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","I think we're into a period where the crude discounts will be very favorable for us in the third quarter. Yes, economically right now we're incentivized to maximize medium sours in our system. I think the hard thing to see when you talk about heavy sours is certainly we agree with your comment; Maya is not priced competitively today. When we roll to August, they have widened the K by another $1.50. And most of the heavy sours that we're buying are not off the Maya formula, which gives us a good incentive for those as well.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, Ed.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I think gasoline is going to be a seam \u2013 congrats on the results. I was just looking at a chart which showed that globally we're 2.5 million barrels a day more gasoline demand than we were before the financial crisis. So how possible is it do you think, and obviously specs have tightened as well around the world, particularly for summer grades. And how possible is it do you think that we just hit a tipping point and this could take some time to resolve?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","I think it will take some time to resolve. We're certainly running all of our gasoline producing units at max utilization. We've seen good utilization in Europe. And as you've mentioned, we're having trouble keeping up with gasoline inventories. So I think it will be here for an extended period.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Coming back then to the more strategic payout versus growth, obviously you've been very clear about what you're planning to do this year. Presumably with VLP also being a little bit, should we say, still needing to develop before you could do something maybe more strategic with that, you would continue to adopt that through into 2016 because obviously your guidance was very much this year. Maybe some broader comments about payout versus reinvesting for growth in the business.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, and so let's put VLP to the side for just a minute. But, Ed, we believe that growth and return of cash to shareholders aren't mutually exclusive, and I think that we've been demonstrating that. We've shared in our analyst presentations a definition of what we would consider to be discretionary and non-discretionary uses of cash, and we explained how we've created a competition within Valero for the use of that cash. And from a capital project perspective, it's largely based on the adequacy of the returns and then the timing to get the projects through our gated process to where we're looking at doing that.","But I don't want \u2013 with our increase in the payout ratio, we view this as an opportunity to return what we would deem to be excess cash to shareholders. It's not at the expense of starving the organization of capital certainly for our maintenance projects but also for our growth strategy projects. We forget that we've got two crude units that we've spent somewhere around $800 million on excluding tanks and infrastructure to support those. Those two projects will be on the first part of next year. We've got investments that we made in Line 9 assets that are going to allow us to take that crude into the refineries, which will provide significant crude benefits for us. That hasn't shown up yet in the earnings because of course Line 9 isn't functioning yet.","So we've got a lot of things we're doing to drive growth in the earnings of our business in addition to returning cash to shareholders. But as we've communicated clearly too, I think we're being very disciplined in our assessment and in our communications of our plans around these projects, and we'll continue to do that. It doesn't mean that Lane and his team aren't looking at a host of very interesting projects for the refining business, but they tend not to be of the order of magnitude like the hydrocracker projects. They tend to be smaller, higher returns, and projects that we can execute quicker. As we run them to ground, we'll be happy to share them.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks very much, very clear.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe. Paul, you may go ahead.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you. Hi, everyone. Could you talk a little bit about the outlook for utilization in the back half of the year, turnaround season firstly for you guys to the extent that you're prepared to do that? And then if you've got any observations on how you see the industry running, that would be helpful. Thanks.","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Hey, Paul, this is Lane. So, we don't really provide forward-looking comments on our turnaround, but I will say I think you'll see a seasonal drop in utilization in the industry going into the late third and obviously the fourth quarter. But I do think you're going to see a pretty heavy turnaround season in the first and second quarter of next year. If you think back, we had the USW strikes, which caused many of our counterparts to delay much of their turnaround activity. So talking to our main contractors, we believe there's going to be a heavy turnaround season in the first half of next year.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Interesting. Lane, while I've got you, could you talk a bit more about crude markets? Particularly, we've been consistently surprised this earnings season by the strength of U.S. oil production through Q2. And also I guess imports are high, and you've talked about some of the spreads that are attractive to you as regards imported barrels. How do you see the market playing out now? Do you get the sense that we are going to see a rollover in U.S. production or not? And also how sustainable do you think the import story is going to be? Thanks.","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Paul, I'm going to have defer to my esteemed colleague, Mr. Simmons, on that, so he'll answer that.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","I think we've been surprised with the decline in rig count, production still seems to be holding. I don't really know that I can give you much insight whether that will continue or not.","I think what we're seeing in terms of the imports is just the volatility in the crude markets. The Brent\/TI [WTI] spread comes in and incentivizes people to start importing foreign light sweet. As we talked about in the past, the first place we tend to do that is our Quebec refinery, which we did in the second quarter. In fact, the Brent\/TI spread got narrow enough that we even took some foreign light sweet into St. James. You see that same dynamic hold on the medium sours. We maximize Mars and domestic medium sour production into our refineries. And then as the differentials come in, we actually brought in some Brazilian grades to compete with that when the markets get tight. So I think as long as you see this volatility, you'll continue to see windows where it supports imports of crudes into the market.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Sure, and I've seen particularly that the foreign light sweet is basically just West African that bounces in and out depending on where the spreads are.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Primarily, yes.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","When we go into turnaround season coming up and as distillate takes leadership in the market in general, I guess you'd be anticipating lower crude prices through Q3 and Q4 if we turn around \u2013 at least to this extent turn around the U.S. refining system.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Yes, I would suspect that that would happen. We're sitting on a pretty good overhang of crude oil inventory here in the U.S. We're 90 million barrels above where we were last year. So with that overhang and then heading into a typical maintenance period where refiner demand is down, you would think that that would have pressure on the price of crude oil.","Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Just checking, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Evan, you may go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys, and I look forward to the VLP strategy evolution over time. My question is maybe a follow-up on the buyback. Given the cash position, especially with the dropdowns, and I know you raised that potential today, your net debt to cap is at 6%. Does that really imply that while active that you're pacing the buyback so you can continue at maybe a similar rate, even in the potentially seasonally weaker margins of other quarters, or really relate to some of the projects that you're maturing in your portfolio with the potential to change that CapEx outlook for 2016?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","When we look at our rate on our buybacks, this is Mike. We do look at our future capital and working capital requirements, and then also what we've committed to do to date. But we do realize that we had a great quarter. Our cash balance built despite doubling our buyback rate. So we will continue to look at these things as we move through the year.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And then, Evan, though, the tail on your question addressed 2016 CapEx. And we haven't gone through the process of reviewing 2016 details with the Board of Directors yet, so we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. But we don't see any material change to 2016's numbers. We've got good projects that have good returns, but as I mentioned, they tend to be much smaller. And we don't expect we're going to come out with a big huge capital number to drop on you.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, even with the methanol and\/or alky unit proceeding?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Look, the methanol plant, as we've talked about, what we're really looking for in a partner there is somebody who's willing to put skin in the game along with us. And of course, we would view a significant part of our capital contribution to be the infrastructure and other assets that we're bringing to the table.","So let's just assume that you're talking about a project that's somewhere around $900 million to begin with, and you ended up with a 50:50 relationship, and part of our contribution to that is going to be what we have in place today. You're not talking about a significant amount of capital from Valero's perspective. We are willing to put some in, but I don't think it's going to exceed anything that we've shared with you. In fact, I'm certain it won't to date. That being said, that project somewhat hinges on our ability to get the kind of transaction that we're comfortable with, number one, that brings expertise to the table; and number two, provides a potential platform for us to do additional transactions down the road. So that's really our view on that. Do you guys want to speak to alky at all?","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Yeah. Evan, this is Lane. So the alky is still in the gated process. It still looks okay. We're going to reach a funding decision, yes or no, somewhere in the first quarter of next year.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, that's good news, guys. And if I could just maybe get one follow-up as we're talking about capital projects, any detail on the McKee expansion startup and\/or Line 9 in the back half the year? Thanks.","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Evan, this is Lane. I'll answer McKee and I'll let Gary answer Line 9. So McKee, we should have the projects entirely complete in September, and that's a plus 25,000 barrel per day crude throughput, so that's the status of that project.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","And on Line 9, Enbridge did get the approval to start up the pipeline from the National Energy Board, which was good news. However, they had a stipulation that they had to hydro-test three sections of the line. They have a plan to do that which has also been approved by the National Energy Board. It does require some permits that they don't have, and then we don't know what will happen with the hydro test. But for us, assuming everything goes well, there's a chance that Line 9 is operational by the end of the year.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good, thanks, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Evan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Dietert of Simmons. Jeff, you may go ahead.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Could you talk about product exports for the quarter, especially I guess both gasoline and diesel, and what you're seeing in the international markets there? And perhaps talk about opportunities to sell gasoline out of the Gulf Coast into California as well.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Jeff, this is Gary. Our export volumes of gasoline were down a little bit in the second quarter, and it was primarily just due to the strength of the domestic markets. We exported 76,000 barrels a day of gasoline. Most all of that volume went to Mexico and Latin America. A small amount of it went to Eastern Canada. On the distillate side, we did 235,000 barrels per day of diesel; then we did another 45,000 barrels per day of jet kero. So total distillates were 280,000 barrels per day, most of that to Latin America. We also sent some of that to Europe. Over 60% of it was to Latin America though.","As far as your question on Gulf Coast exports to the West Coast, in our system, mainly because of Jones Act 3, the way that optimization works is we generally supply West Coast barrels from our Pembroke refinery, and we did do that in the second quarter. Pembroke blended CARB [California Air Resources Board] gasoline, which we took to the West Coast.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Got you. And secondly, the industry is focused on distillate yield over time, with a historical growth rate that was more rapid for diesel than for gasoline. Recently, it seemed gasoline demand has been really strong. Can you talk about maybe some of the major drivers there and how sustainable you think that trend might be?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","I think that the big driver for gasoline demand has just been the lower flat price and demand elasticity and the response to the lower flat price. And so I think as long as we're in this lower price environment, we'll see good gasoline demand moving forward.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Got you. And finally, you've got the Houston-Appalachian unit projects that you've been talking about. And with the tightness in octane, do you see other projects developing to bring more octane into your portfolio?","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Hey, this is Lane. The only thing we're really, we'll have to \u2013 obviously, our re-former margins are very wide. Naphtha is very discounted. We're focused on getting our re-forming unit capability tuned up. We've been working on it all summer to make sure that we are getting full utilization of our current assets. We don't have a whole lot of other, besides the alky, of projects in the pipeline to address the shortage on the octane side yet.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Okay, thanks for your comments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chi Chow of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. You may go ahead.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks a lot.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Chi.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi, Joe. How are you doing?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","It looks like you've had this structural uptick in margin capture in the North Atlantic region really over the last four quarters or so. Is this really the result of crude slate optimization at Quebec, or are there other factors contributing to that trend?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Chi, I would say that the biggest driving factor has certainly been that we're supplying the Quebec refinery with domestic crude from the U.S. Gulf Coast. Again, that's an economic optimization, but we've put our Corpus dock in place during the quarter, which gave us a further incentive to get those barrels to Quebec. In April, 95% of the barrels we ran in Quebec were domestic barrels, and I think that's been the biggest reason.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","And do you believe once Line 9 starts up, are you going to get another uptick in that capture rate just with the additional flexibility you've got with Line 9?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Yes, we certainly think that that will be the case. If you look at today's economics, a barrel off Line 9 into Quebec would have about a $3 a barrel margin advantage over something that we're sourcing from the Gulf Coast. So if this holds, it would be a fairly significant uplift.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good to hear, okay. And what's your outlook for refining dynamics in Europe going forward here for Pembroke?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Pembroke is a little bit unique, I would say, Chi, in that it's really satisfying that the domestic market in the UK with some export capability. So it tends to not be as exposed to import barrels, for example, as some of the other European refineries might be. But I think our view is the same. Longer term, Western Europe and the Med have probably the least competitive refineries out there. And as barrels move into those markets, they're going to be exposed.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","All right, okay, one final question here. In California, obviously, it's been a great environment out there this year. How do you see things playing out in the second half? Do you expect ongoing strong gasoline cracks there for the balance of the year?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Yes, it's difficult to predict. Certainly, as you know, as we head out of driving season, demand weakens a little bit, and then you get more butane blending into the pool. That will swell production some. So to me, a lot of what happens on the West Coast will be supply-driven. And some of these refinery outages that we've been seeing, will they continue or not will really determine how strong the West Coast market will be.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","But your plants are running well at this point out there?","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Chi, this is Lane. I've got to knock on wood, they've been running very well.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","It shows up in the second quarter. Okay, thanks a lot.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. You may go ahead.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Faisel. How are you, Faisel?","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right, just a couple quick questions. First is just going back to some of the comments around your payout ratio, I just want to make sure I understand. So this year we're looking at a 75% payout ratio. And then just so I understand how that evolves as we go into next year, is it wait and see, or should we expect something similar in that range? I appreciate all the commentary around capital spending and everything.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're in the process of running I guess our strategic plan and budget for next year, and so we really haven't come up with guidance that we're prepared to give at this particular time.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, understood. Is it fair to say there's \u2013 is there something special about this year versus the forward years that makes the payout ratio 75% this year different than \u2013 I'm just trying to understand how you guys are philosophically looking at the outlook on this payout ratio.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Philosophically, we started the year saying we want to achieve a minimum 50% payout ratio. I think you could expect that if the business is performing, that would be a minimum that we'd like to live with going forward. You know the potential volatility in this business, and so what we have committed to is we've given you an indication of what we deem to be the minimum cash that we want to keep on the balance sheet. We've got a capital budget that's certainly under control and very manageable. And the other thing we can tell you is that we don't plan to raffle cash. So depending on the performance in the business, we would look at returning surplus cash flows to shareholders. That being said, there are other opportunities that may come up that from quarter to quarter we'd want to change that.","But again, if you look at what we've said in the analyst presentations, we're committed to maintaining the assets. We're committed to the dividend. We will continue to look at the dividend going forward and make changes as we see fit. And then we're going to let the investment-grade rating overall govern it. So I think we're very comfortable taking this year's payout to 75%, and I think you could expect that we'll try to maintain a 50% level going forward.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very clear, thank you. This is the last question. I believe you've received the last set of rail cars, the 5,300 you purchased. I'm trying to understand. How is that fleet being utilized now? I know the differentials have been pretty narrow. But I'm just trying to understand what the fleet utilization is given the current market situation.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","We certainly saw in the second quarter that we didn't have near the advantage to ship crude by rail that we have been seeing in the past. However, the differentials are coming back up, and so we see that we'll start ramping up volumes in our Lucas terminal. We're still taking volume to Memphis via rail, St. Charles as well. So we're utilizing the rail cars, and then some of the general purpose cars that we have we are going ahead and transitioning into our ethanol service.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Martin Parrish - Vice President-Alternative Fuels","And this is Martin Parrish. On the ethanol, we run at least 2,800 cars there routinely in that business. We don't see that changing, so we've got a lot of room there for rail cars.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thanks for the time, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Gresh of JPMorgan. Philip, you may go ahead.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning, so just one follow-up first on the distillate exports. Obviously, the trends have softened over in Asia in the past month or so. I was just wondering what you're seeing more recently relative to the 2Q trend and whether that distillate arb is still there for export. Just in general, what's going on?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","I think we're still seeing good demand in Latin America for the distillate exports. That's still there. The other big market for us, Europe, we've been hovering around breakeven, and it's still about there. The big thing that's impacting that is freight. So the freight has been varying anywhere from $0.07 to $0.11. And depending on freight, it means that the arb is either open or closed. I would tell you today it's about breakeven.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, okay. And on the commentary about potentially accelerating drops, I'm curious how you're thinking about the capacity for drops right now. And if you accelerate it, how much more would you be able to do? How much could the market handle in your view?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It wasn't really commentary. It was just a comment. And I think that what we've done, this year we're going to end up slightly over our $1 billion. Next year I think we'll end up slightly over what we're doing this year. Your sense on how big that market is, is probably as good as our sense on how big that market is. But we think that we can execute the transactions and do the drops on the pace that we're thinking about without rattling the market. So, Rich, is there anything that you'd add to that?","Richard F. Lashway - Director, President & Chief Operating Officer","No, I think that's the plan and to grow distributions in that targeted 25% range.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. Phil, we just haven't wavered on that. And I don't know if you could hear Rich or not but the point was that we've still got the 25%-plus distribution growth as our target.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure, okay. And just to confirm on the buybacks that the buyback target is just as a percent of net income and you're going to also add in 100% of all dropped capital on top of that in terms of buybacks. I believe that's something you said in the past. I just wanted to confirm that?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me say what we've said in the past is 50% plus the cash proceeds for buybacks. So resetting the target to 75% of net income is now going to be 75% of net income. Mike, you want to elaborate on that?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, that's pretty much it.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So the drops, of course, and you know this, Phil. We haven't taken a lot of free cash in on these drops yet. And until VLP has access to the public markets, we'll probably continue to have a limited amount of cash that we get from VLP for the drops. So from our perspective, what we've done is just simplify the way to look at this, and we're saying it's 75% of net income.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, fair enough. And I guess to the extent that M&A opportunities do come up on the midstream side, and you've mentioned you'd rather wait a year to get investment-grade, et cetera. But if something comes up that is attractive to you, would you consider doing M&A at the Valero level for midstream and then dropping it down later, or is it more of a let's wait and see how it goes for the next year and not really looking at those sets of opportunities right now?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Would we consider doing an acquisition the Valero Energy level? Sure, we would look at that and compare that to our other uses of cash and make that decision, but we would consider it.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Phil, we're not opposed at all to acquisitions, and we tend to look at everything that's out there. And we're well positioned to do acquisitions, but we just haven't found one yet that we think adds value for Valero shareholders.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Fair enough. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, good morning, everybody.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Joe, periodically you've talked about whether the West Coast was strategic for Valero. And obviously, it's been \u2013 I guess with the Torrance situation in February that this sector has never really looked back against the strong gasoline demand. So I'm just curious. Does your view on the strategic importance of the West Coast change given recent events, or just update us on how you're thinking about that?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Doug, honestly, I think it's been in the past and it's really well in the past that we looked at potential dispositions around the West Coast. Subsequently, we've said that we view the West Coast as a great option. I think Lane has answered the question that even when margins were challenged out there, we were cash flow positive on the West Coast. We continue to monitor our investments out there so that we don't end up going cash flow negative, but it does provide a very interesting option for periods like this where we've got basically extraordinary cracks. And so I would tell you that this management team hasn't changed their perception, that we really like having the West Coast assets, which as Lane said, are running very well. They have strong management teams. We're very comfortable and pleased to have them as part of this asset portfolio.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, I appreciate the answer. Joe, my follow-up is really more really to get your sense as to what you're really seeing in this market currently. And really you've not made any secret of the fact that we all know this is a seasonal business and we've had a lot of extraordinary events this year, starting with Torrance, albeit against a backdrop of very strong demand. And I guess what I'm really getting at is that last year gasoline cracks were zero in December, and we're probably going to see 0.5 million barrel a day drop in demand in gasoline seasonally between now and the end of the year.","So my question to you is do we see the typical rotation towards distillate given where distillate cracks are right now from yourselves and from your peers? And not so much from your peers but from yourselves as far as what your plan would be? If your LP is still telling you to max gasoline, do you keep running that until it flips even though the gasoline demand drops? Because obviously that's a harbinger for weaker gasoline cracks in the second half of the year. So we're all wrestling with this, obviously I just want to get your perspective as to how you're planning to run Valero's business if cracks remain at a significant premium for gasoline over diesel.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Gary, do you want to?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Yeah, so overall, the way our optimization works is it would be like you suggested. We would continue to maximize gasoline as long as the prompt market supports doing that. Looking forward, I do see that you'll have the general seasonal trends and that we'll see some fall-off in gasoline demand, again, a lot of that probably weather related. But I would expect as we head into the third and fourth quarter that gasoline would get some weaker and distillates strengthen, and we'll put ourselves back into a max distillate mode.","The other thing I think happens in the market is, the Northwest Europe 2-1-1 yesterday was around $15. And as it falls below $15, that's when you start to see utilization in Europe fall. And so I think you'll see utilization fall, some due to economics in Europe and then also seasonal maintenance, which will open up the distillate arb again from the U.S. Gulf to start supplying that market with diesel.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Gary, maybe I could just risk a quick follow-up on that topic. There has been a lot of chatter about delays and ultimately startups, and you're finally coming in Middle East refining. That obviously is probably going to back into the Atlantic Basin some European product. So I'm just curious. From an international perspective, we've all been waiting on this international refinery expansion coming, and it never really seems to have arisen. Do you have any perspective as to whether those things are finally coming online, and if so, how you see it impacting the current market environment? And I'll leave it there, thank you.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","The only thing I can really tell you is we have not seen an impact in the current market from anything happening in terms of the refinery capacity additions. And our view is that the place that you'll probably see that is more in the eastern Med, which is not really a market we tend to go into.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Doesn't that back into the Atlantic Basin though?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","It could, but again, we have not seen any indication of that as of yet.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Doug, the other thing to keep in mind is that U.S. Gulf Coast refining is very competitive. And so your concern is that ultimately these barrels get pushed back at us, what you might do is have some rationalization. But I think that goes to \u2013 if you're going to assume it's a zero-sum game, there's going to be winners and losers, and U.S. Gulf Coast refining is going to hold its own very well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Talked a lot about returning capital to shareholders and improvement this year and absolutely deserve congratulations for that. I'm curious though. Given a year where margins have been so strong, obviously helped out on the West Coast, fairly \u2013 if I look at Q3 guidance for throughputs, not really much growth year over year relative to actual numbers. The growth in McKee, what else should we be thinking of as we look forward to 2016 in terms of thinking about earnings growth or cash flow growth or free cash generation? Is it more modest CapEx that helps out? It's hard for us to think about replicating West Coast margins, although the Gulf Coast could obviously be strong. I'm just trying to think about, other than the growth in VLP, where else do we look for some increases in 2016 and maybe into 2017?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We spoke to this briefly earlier today. We've got three projects that will be on stream certainly by the beginning of next year. We've got the two crude toppers, Corpus and Houston, and those will produce significant returns for our shareholders. And then we've got the Line 9 project, which Gary mentioned earlier. We've invested a couple hundred million dollars to prepare to process that crude at our refineries and we haven't received the benefit of that yet. So we've got those three things that are clearly in hand. And then down the road we've got the Diamond pipeline, which will certainly add benefit to the Memphis refinery. And then as I mentioned, we've got the methanol project that we continue to look at. And then Lane's got some other smaller that you'd almost call self-help or optimization projects, which we're running the traps on. And then Martin Parrish has some of those similar type of projects for the ethanol business.","So there's no hydrocracker, Roger, that's coming on that's going to create some step change in what we're looking at, but we don't feel we need to do that. We've got a great portfolio that we're executing very well. We have a great team that's making sure that our assets are available and running, and we will see continued growth as a result of that.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I appreciate the answer. And then getting back to the questions that have been asked earlier on the distillates side, a small part of the overall complex, the jet inventories have really increased significantly over the last several months. I'm just wondering if there's any color you can provide on that. I'm talking about total U.S., but you could also point to Gulf Coast jet is up fairly significantly.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","I really don't know that I have any commentary on that, Roger, on what's driving that.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, good enough for me. Thanks, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. You may go ahead.","Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning. I hope you're doing well. Gary, I wanted to go back. I think there was a lot of discussion on the strength of gasoline, and you talked about potentially maximizing distillate and gasoline depending on the market dynamics. If my model is set up correctly, it looks like you've been trending at a product yield toward gasoline to the tune of about 48% pretty consistently. Can you remind us what kind of flexibility you actually have to swing that back and forth?","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","This is Lane. I'll give it a shot. So right now with naphtha so dislocated, normally we'd flex that in and out of the distillate pool, but you really need to compare it to jet. So if you say if it's really discounted we're going to take that out of the mix. We have about probably a 4% ability to change our gasoline to distillate mix. If you were to be in a posture where you have been trying to make naphtha, it would be even bigger than that. It would be more like 8% to 9%. But today, we've been trying to minimize naphtha just because of where the market is on naphtha.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, Lane, is it fair to think going into 3Q we may see a little bit higher yield on gasoline just given its strength here?","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Gary alluded to it earlier. We run our models and we have a forward view and we run our assets into that forward view. And I think seasonally, most of it \u2013 somewhere in October-ish we normally see a switch in the signals where we'll maximize diesel at the expense of gasoline.","Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.","Okay.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Blake, are you trying to understand, are we maximized on gasoline today at a 48% yield?","Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.","Yes, yes.","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","The answer to that is yes.","Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.","Okay, okay, I'm just trying to get a step change going in moving forward. So, Joe, you briefly touched on M&A at the parent company level. And I guess as I look at the equity price moving higher as a result of these aggressive buybacks, I'm just curious. Is it fair to think that as the stock price moves higher and you have considerations of what to do with capital, does asset-based M&A become more likely as Valero shares move higher?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I wouldn't say it's more likely because, Blake, we always have an eye towards it, and we tend \u2013 and historically we've done this too. We've tended to look at M&A opportunities outside of the context of the capital budget because Mike's got a balance sheet here that's like gold-plated, and so we have plenty of opportunity here without using the equity to do that.","Our real focus here has been twofold, and we've talked with you about this. Number one, try to demonstrate earnings potential for the company through excellent operations, and try to get our multiple to the point where we're not trading at a discount to the peer group, and that's the number one focus. Number two then, what that does is provide you with the opportunity to do something with the equity if you ever choose to do a very significant transaction. And although we don't have anything like that on the radar screen today, we could do fairly sizeable transactions with the balance sheet as it sits today without \u2013 and in this case, it would be highly accretive transactions without negatively impacting things. Now that being said, we've looked at the market, we've looked at what's out there, and we just haven't seen anything yet that warrants us to do that.","Blake M. Fernandez - Howard Weil, Inc.","That's very clear. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC. Brad, you may go ahead.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everybody, maybe one for Gary. Thinking about McKee, you guys have obviously made some strides into getting more Midland barrels into that refinery. Do you have any thoughts on Midland trading at a premium right now, whether you think that's sustainable, and whether you guys are optimizing the Midland out of that refinery and going back to Cushing, or how are you dealing with it in?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","We don't have a lot of flexibility at McKee to swing between the Midland and Cushing markets. A lot of what we have are term contracts with producers that are tied to one market or the other. I think we're probably in a realm where Midland stays fairly strong because there's a lot of takeaway capacity from that market. And so our view would be that Midland stays pretty close to parity to the Cushing market or could trade at a slight premium to it.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thanks for that. And then, Joe, any thoughts on the proposed renewable volume obligations at this point?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's very interesting, and I'm sure you've read some of the same stuff that we've read here recently. The notion of shifting the obligation seems to be being recognized as a potential positive. I think that there was a letter that was put out here this past week that somebody shot across my desk, which talked about the fact that shifting the obligation might actually lead to incremental blending of ethanol. And so it certainly would be a huge benefit to us if that were to take place. Martin, is there anything you'd like to add?","Martin Parrish - Vice President-Alternative Fuels","I think on the RVOs itself, certainly for 2015 it's pretty achievable. You get a little tighter to the blend wall in 2016. But with the carryover RIN, we don't see that as a real big issue. So the question, as Joe said, is where does the obligated party go and what happens in 2017.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And that's more of a long-term solution for us than short-term relief, but we're hopeful. We always are.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. You may go ahead.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys, two quick follow-ups. One, in the past, Joe, I think Valero raised dividends two times a year, and the second time is around this time. And so on a going-forward basis, have you guys changed the process to become more of an annual process?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Paul. We have raised it two times a year. Typically, they've been a little bit more modest than the one that we did back in January. And I can let Mike speak to this a little bit. Do you want to take a shot?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I guess we had a very significant increase in the dividend in January. And as I had mentioned earlier, obviously, we've got a material amount of cash, so we will be looking at our options to utilize that cash over the next few months. One of those is obviously the dividend.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. I guess, Joe, what I'm asking is that is there an intent, effort from management to change that to become an annual consideration, or that this is more ad hoc, that we shouldn't really look at say in the past it was two times a year and now that you look like this year is one time, to see if there's a process that we should know.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, I understand, Paul. Let me just say this. Bi-annual (sic) [Semi-annual] (59:36) increases in the distribution, in the dividend, wasn't something that we've institutionalized. And so in this case, the large increase we had back in January was because we were lagging. And I think we have a sense that there's opportunity to raise the dividend again.","Now what I don't want you to do is hold me something going forward that we're going to continue to raise the dividend twice a year into perpetuity. But I do think it's safe to say, as Mike described, that we're taking a good hard look at it. And, Paul, you know how devastating it is if anyone ever has to cut the dividend, so we're more deliberate on that. It's obviously easier for us and provides for flexibility to buy back shares and return cash that way, but we are looking at the dividend.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. The second one is for Lane to see if there's any opportunity in the reformate (1:00:32) for your alkylate or re-former units in your system, or that you're already maxxed out, there's really not much of a debottleneck opportunity there?","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Hey, Paul, I alluded to this earlier. We did, this was unusual versus where the signals around the re-formers have been in a couple of years. So we had to relearn in terms of where we could run the re-formers. We've always been maximizing alkylate. Our alkylation units have been very good for several years now, but we are at our maximum in reformate and alkylate capacity today.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Have you gone into and seen whether you can make some small investment and be able to expand the capacity on those units inside your system, or that you haven't done that process yet?","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","We are. We did a robust look at all of our alkys. We started really looking at our alkylation units about three years ago and figuring out where we want to spend \u2013 where we wanted to put the dollars, and that's where we landed on this Houston alkylation project. Obviously, it's in our gated process. Joe has mentioned several times on the call. We have a list of smaller projects that we're working. We're being careful not to try to tout them ahead of when they would be ready for show time. But there's clearly an opportunity to address this octane shortfall in the market, and so we're obviously working with those projects.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. You may proceed with closing remarks.","John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Okay, we appreciate all of those who called in today and everyone listening.

Mr. Locke, you may begin.","John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ethan. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are: Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com.

Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone.","We had another strong quarter, as our team operated safely and efficiently. Favorable product margins, which were supported by strong demand during the quarter, incentivized us to run at high utilization rates. While we are seeing some seasonal pressure on product margins today, demand for our products remains strong and crude oil markets continue to be well supplied, so we maintain our favorable outlook for 2016. We continue to focus on our priorities of maintaining safe and reliable operations, investing in our business, and returning cash to stockholders.","Regarding strategic investments, we continue to grow our business. We expect to see contributions in the fourth quarter from our recently completed McKee crude unit expansion, Port Arthur hydrocracker expansion, and from delivered crude off of Enbridge Line 9B.","Additionally, we're making good progress on our two crude unit projects. The Corpus Christi crude unit is ahead of schedule and is expected to start, with a startup date of December 1. We expect startup of the Houston crude unit around the end of the first quarter of 2016, as scheduled. We also executed another dropdown transaction earlier this month to Valero Energy Partners, which is our sponsored MLP.","And finally, regarding cash returns to stockholders, over the first nine months of this year we've delivered a 73% payout of net income, so we're on track to hit our 75% target for 2015. Additionally, the Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in the regular quarterly dividend, which is the second increase approved this year.","So with those highlights, John, I'll turn it back over to you.","John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Joe.","Moving on to the quarterly results, we reported net income from continuing operations of $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share versus the third quarter 2014 earnings per share of $2.00. The refining segment generated operating income of $2.3 billion.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which was in line with the third quarter of 2014. Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the third quarter of 2015 in spite of unplanned downtime, including the refinery-wide outage at our Texas City refinery due to a lightning strike. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.80 per barrel in the third quarter of 2015 were also in line with the third quarter of 2014.","The ethanol segment generated $35 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2015 versus $198 million in the third quarter of 2014. General and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $179 million in the third quarter of 2015. Also in the third quarter, net interest expense was $112 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $482 million. The effective tax rate was 32.4%.","With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end total debt was $7.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.3 billion, of which $51 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was approximately 20%. Valero had over $5 billion of available liquidity excluding cash. The cash flows in the third quarter included $467 million of capital spending, of which $109 million was for turnarounds and catalysts.","We returned $1.3 billion in cash to our stockholders in the third quarter, which included approximately $200 million in dividend payments and $1.1 billion for the purchase of 17.2 million shares of Valero common stock. Year to date we've purchased 35.5 million shares for $2.2 billion.","So for modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.55 million to 1.6 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 235,000 to 255,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 480,000 to 500,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be around $3.80 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.85 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.","We expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation for the fourth quarter to be around $200 million, and net interest expense should be about $100 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $475 million, and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 30%.","Ethan, we've concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we will open the call to questions. During this segment, we continue to ask that our callers please limit each turn to two questions. Callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions as time permits.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil, please go ahead.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Neil.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Joe, can you talk about \u2013 and you alluded to it \u2013 the outlook for product margins as Valero sees it? It sounds like the decline we're seeing in your view is more seasonal than structural. There has been a lot of talk about gasoline versus diesel. And anything you could comment on the demand side, so just broadly some commentary on the product margin outlook would be helpful.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Neil, if you're okay, we'll let Gary Simmons talk about that.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That would be great.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Neil, this is Gary. I certainly do see that what we have this year is just the seasonal nature of our business. We start to get out of gasoline season and you see the gas cracks begin to soften, and typically we go through a period of time where refinery margins are squeezed until heating oil demand begins to kick in.","I think the surprise this year is actually the gas cracks were much stronger for a longer period of time than what we typically see. Even today, a light sweet refiner in the Gulf has a $9 crack spread. If you're running medium sour, it's around $12. And a heavy sour refiner in the Gulf has a $15 crack spread. So to us, those numbers don't look bad at all for this time of year. We see good product demand on the distillate side. Our export markets remain strong. And then on the gasoline side, as the markets in the Gulf have softened some, it's opened up the arbs to start gasoline exports as well. So we feel pretty good about the markets going forward.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Gary. And then the follow-up question is around the dividend. You guys raised your dividend by 25%. So can you talk a little bit about what drove the decision, how you're thinking about the allocation of capital between dividends, buybacks, and organic growth?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, Neil, this is Mike. We went ahead and increased the dividend this quarter. We're having a great year, and we thought it was appropriate to increase it at this time. Going forward, ultimately we would like to get to the position of increasing the dividend annually. And our intention is to pay a dividend at the top end of the range for our peer group.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then, Mike, between buybacks and dividends, any thoughts there?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the dividend payout, our intention is to be at the top end of the range of our peer group. And then as we increase that, buybacks would be a little bit less of the total pie.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Neil, the only thing I'd add to what Mike said is, in the investor presentations we made \u2013 and management made the commitment at the beginning of the year that we'd look at the use of our cash in a non-discretionary and a discretionary way, and clearly we view the dividend as something that is non-discretionary. So when we commit to doing the dividend, we believe we need to maintain the dividend. And so as Mike said, it was a good time to do it. We've had a great year. We want to reward our shareholders, and we'll continue to look at it going forward. So when you look at the total payout ratio, it's based on net income, and we've been very forthright about that. All we're doing really in this case is altering the makeup of that payout ratio and increasing the percentage that would be made up of the dividend.","Neil S. Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. All right, thank you so much.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Evan, please go ahead.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Let me tie your macro comments in the prior answer to the return policy and connect the two. You raised the dividend, had a large step-up in the buyback in the third quarter. I know you have the annual payout guidance which you're closer to your target, but you also have significant room in your net debt to EBITDA guidance. So how do you adjust the buyback between these two metrics according to the margin environment, meaning given your macro view, should we expect a continued pace of buybacks even in a seasonally weaker quarter?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We increased the payout target from 50% to 75% on the last call. So we had to pick up the buybacks quite a bit to meet our commitment to our shareholders and payout to 75%.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, Evan, as Mike said, I think you can expect that we're going to hit the 75% target. That's our objective. So if you're trying to gauge pace of buybacks in the fourth quarter, they're probably going to be at a somewhat slower pace than they were in the third quarter, as we made up ground during the third quarter. I think going forward, as Mike has talked about, we want to maintain the dividend at the high end of the range of the peers. So we will continue to look at it.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's based off of net income. And so we're not providing earnings guidance here on what the fourth quarter would be. So if net income comes in very strong, we'll be buying back a lot of shares.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it, that makes sense. Let me ask a different question, my second question, on the midstream side. I know you funded the last drop to VLP. If that market remains closed, would you do that again in 2016, or can you talk about how you're thinking about that going forward?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, the last \u2013 and this is Mike again. The last drop on October 1, our plan was all along to self-fund that drop. On the capital markets, based on our discussions with the bankers, we do not believe that the capital markets are closed. We believe that they're open. The equity markets have been challenging. There's not been a lot of activity in the last six weeks or so on the equity side, but we do believe that the markets are open.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, I'll leave it there with two, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Evan.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Evan.","Operator","And our next question comes from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse. Edward, please go ahead.","Johannes M. L. Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, it's actually Johannes here playing stand-in for Ed at the moment, a couple of quick questions. First one, I was wondering what your West Coast outlook is given that it was so strong over the last quarter going into next year. Do you have a view on what turnaround activity in 2016 would be and how that may impact that particular crack?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Yes, I think we definitely see a lot of turnaround activity in the fourth quarter of this year, which will probably keep the West Coast market fairly tight. As you move into next year, I think we've seen a good demand response as a result of lower flat price on the West Coast. That will certainly keep that market tighter than what we've seen in the past several years, so we're fairly optimistic on our West Coast operations for next year. I don't really have any insight to turnaround activity. I don't know, Lane, if you...","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","This is Lane. I think it's fairly public knowledge you have a heavy turnaround season currently going on and into the very beginning of the fourth quarter. But I don't have any insight into where the turnaround activity is going to be on the West Coast the first half of next year, and we don't give any forward guidance for Valero in that respect either.","Johannes M. L. Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And generally over the last year there's been a reasonable amount of M&A, either outright M&A and\/or acquisition of assets, and that's in the midstream and in the downstream segments. Is there a reason you haven't participated in it, or is there a way you're thinking about M&A and growth that we could use to see through your eyes, so to speak?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we do participate. We do look at the opportunities as they do become available to us. We have not I guess been able to consummate an acquisition during this time.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And again, our attention to M&A hasn't changed. We continue to look at everything that's out there. And obviously, there have been a couple of deals that have been done. There are a couple of refineries that have transacted this year. And as Mike said, we look at them. And if they're of interest to us we pursue them, and if they're not we don't. Obviously in this case, they weren't of enough interest to us for us to be aggressive.","When you look at the space that might be more rich with opportunities going forward, it seems to be more the midstream business. And again, we look at the opportunities out there, but we've been pretty clear about what we want to do. To the extent we transact there, we'd like for it to be assets that are supportive of Valero's core business. So our view of M&A hasn't really changed, nor has the level of activity that we pursue internally. We just haven't pulled the trigger on anything.","Johannes M. L. Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Is there a framework you use to evaluate the value proposition when it comes to those businesses that might be related to your core business?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Yes, but I don't think we're going to get into what our acquisition criteria is with you, no offense.","Johannes M. L. Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, no problem. Thank you.","John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Thank you.","Operator","and our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Ryan, please go ahead.","Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. It's Igor Grinman here actually chiming in for Ryan. I had a quick question on the crude slate in the quarter. It seemed like the light sweet mix was around \u2013 it looked like record levels or at least as far as I could see here. I'm just curious as to what drove that preference for light sweets in the quarter given the relative widening seen on the sour dip side. Was it running next gasoline mode (18:47) related, or were there some other drivers there? And along the same context, it would be great to hear your latest outlook on the lights versus sours differentials for 2016.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","So you're correct, we did run record levels of domestic light sweet crude during the third quarter. That was somewhat tied to where the crude differentials were, but we also see rate lever that we get from running a lighter crude diet, so that pushed us in that direction. And then also with the strength in gasoline, we get a higher gasoline yield off those types of crudes, so that pushed us to the domestic light sweet as well. As we transition into the fourth quarter, the crude markets remain very volatile. And so we have definitely transitioned to where we're running a lot more sour crudes in the system today than what we did in the third quarter.","I think as you move to 2016, as long as we're in this market that the crude markets are oversupplied, you're just going to see a lot of volatility between the grades. And so we are just going to be responsive. As the markets move, we'll run the diet that is most economic in our refineries.","Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, what are you guys generally expecting out of the 1Q turnaround season? I know you brought up maybe some color on the West Coast side, but just overall U.S.-wide color would be great.","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","This is Lane. We obviously have a dialogue with all of our contractors and we have a large business with them. And the outlook that they're telling us is it will be a fairly heavy \u2013 the first quarter of 2016 will be \u2013 I mean the first half of 2016 will be heavier than the first half of 2015.","Igor Grinman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Phil, please go ahead.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. Not to beat a dead horse on the dividend, but you had a big step up in the first quarter, and this is another sizeable step up. So I was just wondering how you thought about this one in terms of whether it was a bit of a catch-up still going on here to get it to the spot where you wanted as a percent of cash from operations or something along those lines, and whether the increases moving forward would be more ratable over time.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think if we looked at it, we were behind the peers. And Mike laid out what the objective was, Phil, and it's to pay out towards the higher end of that. And so I guess you could look at it as a make-up, in fact, the whole year. I think when we looked at it, we were behind going into the year, and we felt that we needed to try to get caught up. So obviously, that was the case. I think as we get closer to the peers, I think this thing \u2013 the prospective increases would be at a more moderate level.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Second question is just with Line 9B now ramping up, how soon would you expect to see a benefit? To what magnitude do you think you can get access to all of the crude that you're hoping to get through Line 9B, or is there any kind of delay in getting any of those barrels to Quebec? And how do you think about the impact that this would have on margins for the refinery?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","This is Gary again. We purchased pretty much our full volume on what we had committed on Line 9 for November injection, and so those barrels will begin to start showing up in Montreal in December and making its way to the refinery.","In terms of the barrels that are available to us, it's pretty much what we had planned, so we have a mix of Bakken and MSW and Syncrude from Western Canada. With the arb being narrower, the economics aren't quite as strong as what we had envisioned, but Line 9 barrels are still at or better than what we can do from a U.S. Gulf Coast sourced domestic light sweet barrel.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, got it, thank you.","John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Jeff, please go ahead.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","It's Jeff Dietert with Simmons, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jeff. We knew who you were.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","If you could, let's talk a little bit about some of the outages during the quarter, with emphasis on Texas City with the lightning strike. But also, I believe you had some FCC [Fluidic Catalytic Cracking] and alkylate unit downtime during a period when octane was tight, and I was hoping you could talk about the influence those had on 3Q.","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Jeff, this is Lane. Our unscheduled downtime during the third quarter cost us about $116 million, with the big event being this lightning strike that knocked out our substation at Texas City.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","And were there meaningful FCC and alky units down during the quarter? Did that have a meaningful influence as well? It's okay to...","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","I quantified the impact on our results. I'm not really \u2013 I don't think \u2013 I'm not going to comment on the impact that might have had on the market, if that's what you're looking for. I'm just saying \u2013 I'm giving you what happened to us.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","All right. And when you think about the tightness in the octane market and the premiums we saw there, is your view from an industry perspective that that's transient or structural? We did have some industry FCC outages and reformer and alkylation unit downtime and very strong high octane retail gasoline demand. Could you talk about that issue?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Jeff, this is Gary. At least my view is it is more structural in nature. We did have some refinery downtime, but I don't think that was the key driver. I think that as the Gulf Coast refineries are running lighter crude diets that we're out of reforming capacity, you become long naphtha. And as long as you have a strong gasoline market, there's an incentive to blend that naphtha into the gasoline pool, and to do that it takes high octane blend components. In addition to that, some of the big growing export markets have specifications that require high alkylate blends, not necessarily even for octane.","And then finally, I think one of the things that we've seen this year is with where aromatic pricings have been, both toluene and xylene have been under their blend value, which has allowed both of those components to be in the gasoline pool. Assuming we have some strengthening in the aromatics pricing moving forward, you can see that both of those high octane blend components actually get pulled out of the pool and octane premiums remain strong.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Thanks for your comments.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays, Paul, please go ahead.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Two quick questions actually. One, Mike, do you have guidance or a target for the cash payout to your shareholders for 2016 and 2017 yet?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, we don't. We're not prepared today to give the payout target for 2016, but I would anticipate that we'll do that early next year.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, and secondly, maybe for Joe. Joe, on the last six months, the MLP sector has been under tremendous pressure. Just curious that the changing market conditions, does it in any shape or form have changed the management view to how you're going to manage VLP and what that means in terms of the dropdown pays or organic or inorganic investment in that business, and how that relates to the C-Corp.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's a good question, Paul. Let me let Mike fire away first and then if there's anything to add.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Obviously, the capital markets have been very volatile. We continue to market that. But our plan is to continue to execute upon our previously communicated dropdown guidance for 2016, and that's around $1 billion of assets.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet.","John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Paul, please go ahead.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, guys. It was a little bit of a follow-up or somewhat asked by Paul already, but I was wondering about this 75% of net income target. I guess at the highest level, I was wondering why you use net income. It seems like a bit of a bouncy denominator, if that's the right word \u2013 or numerator I guess.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Paul, we're in a volatile business. And whether you use net income or cash flow, I think you just pick one, and we picked net income. So it was one that's very easy for everybody to look at and identify the number. And so it seemed to provide the most transparency from our perspective.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Sure, that's fair enough. And now I guess what you're saying, given that we're new to this, is that your intention is early every year to provide guidance of approximately how much net income share you intend to return?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think you could probably assume that's the case. Paul, I think we did it at your conference last year. And so that's where we laid out the 50% targeted payout ratio. It's our objective to have a stated payout ratio. And again, this is the first year we did it. We set one out there. We viewed it as a target that we wanted to hit. Things went well this year. We were able to raise that target. So philosophically, I think we're going to always look at our cash flows and our free cash and decide what to do with it. And certainly we've set our priorities with the dividend now and with the share buyback program, and we'll continue to pursue it.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Jeff, I wasn't excited enough about our conference in January. I'm super-excited now, so I'll look forward to your announcement January 6.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Paul, we always feel the same way.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Just on a really important thing for us is my second and final question. This whole thing of a view that global distillate is weak, oversupplied, really doesn't come through in your commentary at all. Is this just the strength of Latin America, or could you just provide just more detail, as you see it, on where this distillate is going, and why you can succeed in exporting so much more when there's this perception that the market globally is weak? Thanks.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Paul, this is Gary again. The way we're viewing the distillate markets, we've seen six straight weeks of draws in the stats here domestically. Export demand remains very robust. You have some seasonal maintenance that's coming in. And so I think the combination of seasonal maintenance and exports will keep domestic inventories in check. And then really the wild card is what happens with the weather and heating oil demand.","As you look globally, I think a lot is being made of the stocks in the ARA [Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp]. There's just not a lot of tankage over there. So when we talk about inventory being very high, it's 8 million barrels above where it was last year. I think some of the things that we're seeing is that the Rhine River levels are low and hindering some of the typical demand pulls we see out of the ARA. So to some degree, I think we feel like some of the inventory in Europe may be understated or overstated. But we continue to see very good demand, both Latin America and Europe, for diesel, and feel pretty good about those markets.","Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Interesting, thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi, please go ahead.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. It's Chi, as you know. Hey, just following up on Paul's questions there, could you give us your export volumes for the quarter in both diesel and gasoline?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Sure, this is Gary. Gasoline, we did 89,000 barrels a day of exports, primarily in Mexico and Latin America. And on the diesel side, we did 241,000 barrels a day of exports. It was a 65:35 split between Latin America and Europe. On the distillate, if you include kerosene, it brought us to about 285,000 barrels a day of total distillates.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Gary, and then just one semantic question here. Your non-controlling interest line was a loss in the quarter. What's the detail behind that?","John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations","That's primarily Diamond Green Diesel. The loss had nothing to do with VLP.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, so just a loss incurred at Diamond Green?","John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Yes.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, John.","John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Chi.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Brad, please go ahead.","Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everybody. Joe, I think in the past, you've certainly had a stated goal of narrowing the multiple discount that Valero trades at versus peers. I think you've done the obvious things on that front with the dividend increases and all the repurchases, certainly showing more CapEx discipline. I'm curious as we move forward here how you see the best path towards narrowing that further. Is it just continuing to execute? Is it buying back more shares? Any color there would be helpful.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Brad, that's a good question and it's one that we continue to wrestle with as we look at the strategy going forward. It's hard to really understand what drives the multiples. We look at sum of the parts, and clearly our portfolio is more levered towards refining perhaps than the peers. And so clearly a more diversified set of earnings streams for the company would be something that might lift that multiple.","The other thing that we really couldn't factor in entirely is where having a payout ratio, certainly the dividend that was below the peers might affect us from a multiple perspective. And so you address what you can in a timely manner. And we've addressed now the fact that we've lagged on the payout in the dividend, and we're continuing to look for the opportunities to grow different earnings streams within the business. And the drops from Valero to VLP clearly is targeted at trying to do this. And then we'll continue to look for good projects to grow the refining business, the renewables business, and then we'll look for other business lines that we might be able to get into. The objective would be to do it with a stronger currency. And so we continue to have this as a major point of focus, but I just don't know that there is a silver bullet that you could fire that's going to immediately get the stock rerated and have you up to where your peers are, but we're taking the actions that we can that we think will help drive that way.","Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, that's fair. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Gary Simmons, just thinking about spreads, both Bakken and LLS are relatively tied to WTI. Is that a symptom of declining U.S. crude production? Is it a symptom of too much midstream, or is it just that maybe people haven't been able to arb things on the import side particularly quickly?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","No, I think you really hit the nail on the head. We have a combination of overbuilt logistics in light of flat to declining domestic crude production. So with the current market, the U.S. Gulf Coast bound pipelines from Mid-Continent have tariffs that are greater than where actually the market is today. So you're just seeing people with take-or-pays going ahead to ship even though it doesn't look like they have economics on paper, and that's what's really driving the differentials.","Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And is that something that you think is going to persist until we see a turnaround in U.S. production? For instance, have you guys changed your behavior and you're importing much more at this point and you expect that to widen the arb back out?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","I think the tariff and the midstream situation is here until we get some recovery in production. I would tell you on the imports, that's more the volatility between grades. I think what we saw is that as people started to see that production was falling, it was very supportive of the domestic light sweet pricing. At the same time, medium sour production in the Gulf was growing and medium sour exports in the Middle East were increasing. So all of a sudden, we saw a fairly wide differential between medium sour and light sweet, and it incentivized us to bring in a lot of imports of medium sour into our system.","Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company. Sam, please go ahead.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody. How are you?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Sam.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","In the press release, you guys updated the topper progress. As Brad just pointed out, LLS is below Cushing right now. Maybe the toppers fixed that. But I don't know, what do you make of what looks like everybody trying to flood the Gulf or avoid Cushing on the marketing side for crude right now? And does that change the economics of the toppers at all, or are you more excited about them or less excited than you might have been six months ago?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","I think the weak LLS market is actually supportive of the toppers.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Where we were with \u2013 the economics for the toppers assumed LLS\/Brent flat. And so as LLS is discounted to Brent, it actually improves the economics of those toppers fairly significantly. I think some of the \u2013 two things causing the LLS-to-TI spread being where it is today. One is this overbuilt logistics and people shipping even though the economics don't appear to be supportive. And then secondly, we have a lot of imports coming into the Gulf. So ultimately, you can't keep having these inventory builds of domestic light sweet. We're going to have to see those differentials come off and incentivize refiners to go back to a lighter diet at some point in time.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks for the color. And then just revisiting the October drop and VLP in general, it's true that MLPs have been really volatile. VLP has seemed to be a lot more stable. I don't want to make you repeat yourself on the thinking behind sponsoring that drop in October maybe to a greater degree than people expected. But just to your view, do you think \u2013 it's sort of a chicken and the egg question. But how much of VLP's stability is a function of the strength of the sponsor and you demonstrating that, or how much of the structure of that drop was really preempted and maybe just more being cautious and preserving your outside capital for another time?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Our plan was to self-fund the drop. With this particular drop, though, we're now at a debt-to-EBITDA of about 3.5 times. And so we'd likely not want to be longer than that on a long-term basis. So with the next acquisition, we're going to have to go get our investment-grade credit rating, which our plan is to do that late this year or next year, have the ability to go to the debt capital markets. And then with the ratio of being 3.5 times \u2013 or approximately 3.5 times, the next acquisition also might require an equity component \u2013 or will require an equity component. So from this point forward, I think you would anticipate the capital markets.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. All right, thanks very much.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Blake, please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks, guys. Good morning, just a point of clarification. Mike, you mentioned being at the top end of the peer group for dividends. I just want to double-check. I'm assuming you're using the metric as a percentage of net income and not yield or some other metric like that.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're using payout; that's correct.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then going back to Line 9, Gary, I don't know if you can help us a little bit here. If you could just remind me, we're seeing Cushing, obviously, has been fairly depleted, and the spread between WTI\/Brent has been compressed. Can you remind me of the metrics we should maybe look at as far as what is economical to actually shift those barrels on Line 9 over to Quebec? Should we be looking at Gulf Coast versus Brent, or Brent versus Cushing, just any help you can have there to help us understand it?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","So Line 9 for us is primarily fed with Western Canadian light sweet, then Bakken. And so you're really looking at that spread and comparing it to a U.S. Gulf Coast supply or a foreign light sweet alternative.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And are there any specific numbers you can give to us where it covers transport or where it makes sense to actually move it?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","I don't think we can talk about the tariff we're paying on Line 9.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Blake.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug, please go ahead.","John Locke - Executive Director-Investor Relations","Doug, are you there?","Operator","Doug, your...","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry, I had the volume on mute. I apologize. Good morning, everybody. Joe, one of the advantages you guys have had over the years was obviously your heavy crude diet on the Gulf Coast. And I think obviously you've now seen U.S. production it seems go into decline, at least on the domestic side. What are you thinking is the prognosis of the outlook for how you move your \u2013 or how you choose to run your crude in 2016? And I guess what's in the back of our mind is it's really more of a macro question. Iran potentially coming back on stream, one would expect U.S. production tightens up a little bit, and it seems to us that the advantage might move back in your favor. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of a heavy oil advantage.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Doug, we'll let Gary speak to that.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","So, Doug, I think the way we see it is there's just going to be a lot of volatility between grades. And it certainly is an advantage for someone like us with the quality of refining assets that we have that can swing to a light diet, medium diet, and a heavy sour diet. And that's the way this year shaped up, and I don't think we see it much differently next year. There are times when it's certainly been an advantage to run a very light diet, and then there are other times where we see very good value in Canadian heavies or heavies from Mexico or South America.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But speaking more broadly, Gary, I think as you look at Iranian crude coming into the market, obviously, the more sour crudes that are in the market, I think it's certainly to Valero's advantage because we definitely have the ability to process it. And as Gary is pointing out, we always are optimizing the crude slate, Doug, as you know. But having more availability of sour crude, whether they be mediums or heavies, is certainly to our advantage in the Gulf.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you. I have two other quick ones, if I may, Joe. I guess the second one is also on macro. Again, I don't think you're aware. We've made no secret of our concerns over what we've described as exacerbated volatility on margins, and I want to get your perspective. It goes back to your earlier question on the seasonality of gasoline. As we see it, we're sitting with higher inventories of gasoline, and the cut on light sweet crude in the U.S. seems to be significantly higher. So I'm just wondering if you've got any view as to why we've seen such wide swings on gasoline margins in the winter for the last two or three years and whether you think that repeats again this year once the current maintenance period comes up. And I've got a quick follow-up, please.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","I think we've definitely seen increased demand with the lower flat price. Certainly there's seasonality to gasoline. The gasoline cracks have remained stronger longer than they typically do. But I think the things that we see in the market that are supportive of gasoline going forward is the price of gasoline in the Gulf now has opened up arbs for exports. So certainly in our system we're seeing a significant increase in the volumes we're exporting. Imports to the New York harbor have fallen way off, which is supportive of gasoline. Naphtha export economics have changed to where we're really not putting naphtha into the gasoline pool now. We're exporting naphtha to the Far East. We've seen FCC margins fall off some to where you'll see some sparing of FCC capacity, and then some seasonal maintenance. So I think all of those things we feel like are supportive of the gasoline markets going forward.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right, but my point is that when refinery maintenance comes to an end, if you take the exports out of the equation, you'll think of those as a relief valve, if you like. Do you think the Gulf Coast and the U.S. in general is now oversupplied gasoline in the wintertime or not?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Certainly if we run at very high utilization rates and aren't allowed to export, you could become long, but I don't think we see that that will happen.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. My final one, Joe, I guess this is really more for you. The big step up in the buybacks, whether everyone agrees or not, it seems that margins have been somewhat artificially supported by everything that's gone on this year, starting on the West Coast. But why would you choose to step up to such a big level of buybacks in such a seasonal sector, at least in terms of how share prices have typically traded in the past?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Doug, we had free cash flow available and we did what we said we were going to do, and it is what it is. I think as we look at this going forward, we laid out a target and we're going to hit it. We're not here to build cash. We're here to grow our business and to reward our shareholders. And we thought this was the right time to do it and it was the way to do it. And so that's what led to the timing. If we had had reduced margins this year, you probably wouldn't have seen us step up the target. But here again, we are owned by firms out there and individuals that are looking for a return and for us to use the cash prudently, and we think that's what we did.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, I appreciate the answer, Joe. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Brad, please go ahead.","Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, just a couple quick follow-ups. I was curious on CapEx. It appears that you are way ahead of the budget for 2015 based on the first three quarters. And it would be something like $1 billion in spending in the fourth quarter to actually reach the target. Is there a particular reason for that? Is it the crude topper spending ramping up perhaps, or why would you not be able to come in meaningfully below it?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, for our capital expenditure guidance for 2015, we do remain unchanged at $2.65 billion. Now when we provide this guidance, just to clarify, we mean capital expenditures, turnaround costs, as well as investments in joint ventures. So September year to date, our total is $1.7 billion, so we are trending below the guidance. However, as you all know, we have an option to become a 50% owner in the Diamond pipeline, and we may exercise that option in this quarter.","Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, got it. That's good color. Thanks for that. And then looking at the throughput guidance for the quarter, both Mid-Con and West Coast look to be maybe a little weaker than what we've expected. Is that just turnaround-related?","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","We don't really give forward guidance on turnarounds. But when we set the guidance volumes, we do take turnarounds into consideration. I think if you look in the aggregate, the guidance for this quarter is similar to the fourth quarter last year.","Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Chi, please go ahead.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks. I just want to follow up on the heavy crude markets. It looks like Canadian producers now, we know they have pipeline access all the way from Alberta to Houston, and it looks like the volume of deliveries have ramped up into PAD 3 to about 300,000 barrels a day plus pretty ratably year to date from Canada. How much of a structural change do you think this is with this dynamic on pipeline flows in? And how are you seeing Middle East and Latin American producers react on the pricing of their sours and heavies?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Chi, I would say we've definitely seen greater availability of Canadian heavy in the Gulf. We ran record volumes of Canadian heavy in the third quarter. Really, the medium sour pricing seems to be what's setting the price of the heavy sours. All the heavy sour producers know they have to compete with an ASCI or Mars barrel in the Gulf. And so they price their barrels to be competitive on a quality-adjusted basis with that medium sour barrel in the Gulf. And the Canadian is certainly that same way.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Gary, do you prefer to run a Canadian heavy barrel through the cokers, or would you rather go with a Maya or a Latin America heavy?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations & Systems Optimization","Each barrel presents their own operating challenges, so Lane may be better to answer that. But there are certainly some challenges with Canadian that we don't see with some of the South American barrels that we run. So I don't know, Lane. Do you want to add anything to that?","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","You did a fine job answering that. They'd love to run marshmallows in the cokers.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Take care, Chi.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.

My name is Chris, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ashley Smith. Ashley, you may begin.","Ashley M. Smith","Thanks, Chris, and good morning. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Joe Gorder, President and COO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.","Before we get started, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Okay. As noted in the release, we reported third quarter 2013 earnings of $312 million or $0.57 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $1.1 billion or $1.90 per share in the third quarter of 2012. Without the adjustments noted in the release, our reported earnings for the third quarter of 2012 were $674 million or $1.21 per share.","Operating income was $532 million compared to $1.3 billion of operating income in the third quarter of 2012 or $1.7 billion when adjusted for the items noted in the release. The decrease was mainly due to lower refining margins across all of our refining operating regions.","Our third quarter 2013 refining throughput margin of $7.76 per barrel declined more than $5 per barrel versus the third quarter 2012 margin of $13.12 per barrel. The decrease was primarily due to significantly lower gasoline and lower diesel margins. For example, the Gulf Coast gasoline margin on Brent crude fell 57% from $9.33 per barrel in the third quarter of 2012 to $3.97 per barrel in the third quarter of 2013, while the Gulf Coast diesel margin dropped by $2.74 per barrel or 14% to $16.86 per barrel.","Despite the decline, diesel margins were still quite strong in the third quarter of 2013. To capture these strong margins, Valero increased its distillates production by 16% to 1,047,000 barrels per day, which also represented an increase in the percentage yield of distillates versus the third quarter of 2012. This favorable yield shift is mainly attributed to the operation of new hydrocrackers at Port Arthur and St. Charles.","Now, also contributing to the lower refining throughput margins were narrower discounts relative to Brent crude oil for light sweet, medium and heavy sour crudes. For a light sweet crude example, the WTI discount fell sharply by $13.44 per barrel from $17.30 per barrel in the third quarter of 2012 to $3.86 per barrel in the third quarter of 2013. Additionally, light sweet crude on the Gulf Coast was more expensive, with the premium for LLS crude relative to Brent higher by $0.66 per barrel in the third quarter of 2013 versus the third quarter of 2012. Heavy sour crude oil discounts also narrowed, with the Maya crude discount, $1.68 per barrel smaller in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012. In the fourth quarter, crude oil discounts to Brent have improved versus the third quarter. WTI discounts have widened by $4.46 per barrel, and LLS has improved by $6.46 per barrel, going from a premium to a discount versus Brent. Also, the Maya heavy sour discount has widened by $6.14 per barrel since the third quarter.","So refining throughput margins were also negatively impacted in the third quarter of 2013 by the higher costs of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, needed to comply with the U.S. federal Renewable Fuel Standard. The reported compliance costs were $185 million in the third quarter of 2013 versus $70 million in the third quarter of 2012. Given the recent drop in RINs prices, following news of the EPA's potentially favorable revisions to the 2014 renewable volume obligation, we have reduced our estimated cost for complying with the Renewable Fuel Standard to a range of $500 million to $600 million for the full year 2013.","Our third quarter 2013 refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day for an increase of 172,000 barrels per day from the third quarter of 2012. Refining throughput volumes were higher due to fewer unplanned refinery and maintenance events and less weather-related downtime. You may recall that Hurricane Isaac negatively impacted operating rates at our Louisiana refineries in the third quarter of 2012.","Refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2013 were $3.74 per barrel, similar to the third quarter of 2012. Although natural gas prices increased year-over-year, our higher throughput volumes in the third quarter of 2013 favorably offset the higher energy costs per barrel.","Our ethanol segment reported operating income of $113 million in the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $186 million from the third quarter of 2012, mainly due to higher gross margins per gallon and higher production volumes. Production averaged 3.4 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2013 for an increase of 992,000 gallons per day compared to the third quarter of 2012. We increased our ethanol production to capture the higher gross margins available to us.","In the third quarter of 2013, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $170 million.","Net interest expense was $102 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense was $448 million.","The effective tax rate was 27.5%, which was lower than guidance, primarily due to an adjustment in deferred taxes as a result of a U.K. tax law change.","Regarding cash flows in the third quarter of 2013, capital expenditures were $557 million, including $78 million for turnarounds and catalyst. We returned $151 million in cash to our stockholders by paying $122 million in dividends and by purchasing approximately 800,000 shares of Valero common stock for $29 million. We ended the third quarter with approximately $3 billion remaining under our stock purchase authorizations. Subsequent to the third quarter, we bought approximately 2.6 million shares of Valero common stock for approximately $90 million. This brings our total year-to-date stock purchases to almost 17 million shares for a total of $675 million.","With respect to our balance sheet at the end of the quarter, cash was $1.9 billion, total debt was $6.6 billion, our debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 20.2%, and we had over $5.0 billion of available liquidity in addition to cash.","We maintain our guidance for capital expenditures, including turnaround and catalyst, at approximately $2.85 billion for full year 2013 and approximately $3 billion for 2014.","So for modeling our fourth quarter operations, you should expect refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.45 million to 1.5 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 245,000 to 255,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be around $4 per barrel.","For our ethanol operations in the fourth quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.5 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.","Also in the fourth quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $175 million, and net interest expense should be about $100 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter should be around $425 million, and our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter should be approximately 37%.","Okay, Chris, we have concluded our opening remarks. We will now open the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Okay, Chris.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm going to take my full quota of 2, if I may. So one specific for Valero and one industry, if I may. Actually, I don't know if I missed this in your remarks, but can you quantify, please, how the hydrocrackers contributed to EBITDA in the quarter and if you could put it in the context of the guidance that you had given us for your expected run rate when these projects were underway? And I've got a follow-up on the industry, please.","Ashley M. Smith","Yes, Doug. The St. Charles hydrocracker came up in the -- in July of the third quarter and pretty much hit full run rates by mid-August. Both hydrocrackers performed very well, particularly given -- relative to expectations in this margin environment. Specific EBITDA performance, we're not going to provide on these units or pretty much any other unit going forward. We get hundreds of units throughout our refineries, and it's just too tough to reconcile and manage expectations and to audit each of those. So we -- those units have performed well.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But in the context, you did give a specific guidance for what you thought they would contribute. Can you at least frame the contribution relative to that former guidance?","Ashley M. Smith","Yes. It's -- given the margin environment, because the guidance was in terms of a margin set, under certain margin sets, it -- they performed within guidance, within expectations of those -- that guidance.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. My industry question -- I'm going to leave it to someone else to talk about riddance [ph], but my issue is on utilization rates for the industry. The context I really want to set here is that we've obviously still got very low feedstock prices, particularly natural gas. But we've also got some refineries that have expanded and refineries that have been given something of a reprieve on the East Coast. So what I'm kind of curious about is your thoughts on overall gasoline capacity in the U.S. against a weak demand backdrop and whether or not you think the weakness we saw on margins in the third quarter could be something about kind of new dynamic that may have us reset or lower our expectations for mid-cycle margins. And I know it's a bit of a broad question but just curious on your thoughts on that.","S. Eugene Edwards","Okay. Doug, this is Gene. In general, I think the margins in the third quarter are getting squeezed. And I think you probably saw some economic running cuts [ph] towards the end of the quarter, in September, primarily, but you also had turnarounds coming into play. But then moving forward in the fourth quarter, I think you got to look at what type of crudes you're running. If you're running imported sweet crude, your margins are pretty bad right now. But on domestic crude, with the differentials blowing out, I think you're seeing better margins in the U.S. And I think you'll see utilization rates in the U.S. higher versus Europe going forward because of crude advantage and the natural gas advantage.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","How does that impact your thinking then about incremental use of cash in a go-forward basis if the margin environment is going to be more challenging? I'm thinking about your decision to move forward with another step-up in your spending.","S. Eugene Edwards","Well, I think the margin environment in the U.S. is going to be better. It's going to be squeezed in Europe because, again, the crude -- where you have advantaged crudes, you're going to have better than average worldwide margins. And where you don't have advantaged crudes, you're probably going to be a little bit below mid-cycle.","William R. Klesse","The step -- this is Klesse. The step-up in our spending, let's get it in context from the guidance I've given, is about $0.5 billion, and this is guidance. The market is giving us opportunities in the sense of increased crude oil production at a discount. So the light sweet crude is at a discount to Brent widening. We have the NGLs that are clearly coming to the entire industry, whether it's petrochemicals or refining. And then you look at what we're doing, we're spending a lot of money on logistics because the part of your question actually dealt with exports, let's be honest, and that is a huge part of the future for the refining. So maybe at the most, we're talking about guidance of $0.5 billion, and frankly, we've disclosed this in our last presentation, how it's split out. We gave that guidance. It shows a lot of it's logistics and it's -- being in half is economic. But we're still in this period of time where we're scoping these projects. But in our endeavor to keep you all informed, we told you guys what we were looking at. So that's how we justify. But clearly, in the view of this industry in the United States, as Gene just was speaking, you have to be able to export. And operating rate will be higher because we think that the U.S. industry, certainly between the Appalachian Mountains and the Rocky Mountains, is extremely competitive in the world environment.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","With LLS and Mars prices being soft here early in the fourth quarter, there's a great advantage for Valero on the Gulf Coast and also a strong disincentive to import crude into the Gulf Coast. Could you talk about how these discounted light and medium prices in the Gulf Coast are impacting your crude imports and how you think it might impact the industry as a whole, imports into the Gulf Coast?","Joseph W. Gorder","Well, Doug, this is Joe. I mean, obviously, they've backed out our waterborne light sweet imports, and we basically were there months ago. The only time that we brought in any light sweet waterborne imports into the Gulf Coast was when there were distressed cargoes out there that we could buy and take advantage of operating with. So this is not a new phenomenon here. It's just kind of a continuation. If we talk specifically about the light sweets, I mean, we got production -- and it's a fundamental issue. We got production way up, 7.9 million barrels a day, pass-through [ph] inventories are now at 194 million barrels, which is 10 million barrels above last year, and it's at 5-year highs. And although we've seen draws in Cushing that brought them down, we've seen builds over the last couple of weeks. But essentially, what you've got is supply of domestic light sweet crude exceeding demand in the Mid-Continent. And that crude, with all the pipelines that we've been talking about for some time now, flowing to the U.S. Gulf Coast, and it's creating length down there. So it is pressuring those margins. And we expect that, that's going to continue for some time. Medium sour has got to compete for space in the refinery. And Mid-Continent production pushing down there is pressuring Mars, and that's where it is today. And then as Ho-Ho [ph] comes on, and you're going to be able to move more Mid-Continent barrels over to the Louisiana markets, I think you're going to see even more pressure on it. So I think we're in it for an extended period of discounted light sweet crude on the Gulf Coast, as well as solid medium sour discounts. And then I think you didn't ask about heavy sour, but it all ties into the same issue. You've got heavy sour discounts looking very attractive right now. A lot of it has to do with fuel oil weakness because we've got weak Asian demand. And then you've got more supply of fuel oil coming into the market with Middle Eastern and Russian production increases. So the inventories of fuel oil are way up. You've got WTS, which we benefited on discounts improving lately because of refinery outages. And then you have Longhorn barrels. Now they're coming to the Gulf that in the past quarter, were headed to the Cushing market. So you're seeing more medium sour head to the Gulf, but the WTS discounts are coming off a bit. So -- and then you got the K factor. So you've got very solid discounts on your heavy sours, on your medium sours and on your light sweets. And we're starting to see those barrels run through the plants in October, and we're seeing much more significant discounts headed for us in November. So we're very optimistic about where the crude discounts are. Long answer [indiscernible].","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Secondly, you guys have been successful moving Eagle Ford barrels out of Corpus Christi to Qu\u00e9bec. And I believe you're permitted to move 100,000 barrels a day. That arb is wide open. Eastern Canada imports about 600,000 barrels a day, light crude. Will more crude move from Corpus, Houston, St. James up to Eastern Canada, given the arbs, where they are today? Could you discuss that and maybe some of the constraining factors?","Joseph W. Gorder","Well, Jeff, it is. Yes, you will see more of the domestic crude moving up to Canada. And I think -- I don't know if you know. Gene, I don't know if you know enough about it on how much they can feasibly run up there. I can tell you that for us, we are running Eagle Ford crude in the Qu\u00e9bec City refinery today, and we got WTI crude headed that direction. So we're doing what we can to go ahead and move barrels up there, and we're learning how to run these crudes at Qu\u00e9bec City as we go. So do you want to speak to the...","S. Eugene Edwards","Well, some of the other refineries up there, they are predominantly medium sour-type refineries. But I imagine they have some capabilities running sweet, but I just don't know what. I'm sure they're running their LP models, and they're trying to optimize that as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Kessler of Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I want to see if we could touch a little bit more on this kind of U.S. versus Europe dynamic. Looking, for example, at your North Atlantic margin contribution or operating income, I'm wondering if you could split out that income in the third quarter between, say, Qu\u00e9bec City on this side of the pond and Pembroke on the other side.","Ashley M. Smith","Robert, we're not going to break out those details. We report by region, but we're not going to give results by refinery.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Any color you could provide on the market? I mean, your volume guidance for the North Atlantic region for the fourth quarter would imply you're still going to keep the European side running. Where are you relative to kind of cash costs on a crack spread today at that plant? Can you give us some kind of color there?","Ashley M. Smith","We don't have any guidance for you on that, either.","William R. Klesse","I think we'll just stick with the general stuff that you read in the industry, and that is, until this dip the other day in Brent pricing, it was reported there were a lot of cutbacks in throughput rates in Europe. And then there was a cutback, and it says -- in the industry data, everyone says there's some profit in Europe [ph]. Our system is a little unique in the sense as we do try to run an Atlantic Basin strategy and we do have marketing in the U.K. and Ireland. And so we'll leave it at that.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess my second question then, third quarter exports for you of gasoline and diesel out of the U.S.?","Joseph W. Gorder","Yes. We exported 193,000 barrels a day of diesel and 91,000 of gasoline, and those numbers are looking larger for the fourth quarter so far. We continue to have low inventories. We got a global demand growth, and we got very consistent demand out of Latin America. And so -- and we're seeing it industry-wide and from Valero's perspective. Right now, Rob, the arb -- the diesel arb to Europe is opening, ignoring the RIN, and that's the first time it's been like this here in a while. So we're very optimistic about the ongoing pull of products out of the Gulf to Europe and Latin America.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I think your capacity to export on the diesel side is 280,000, moving to 400,000 or 425,000. When do you move up to that 400,000-plus?","Joseph W. Gorder","Well, we've got all these capital projects that Bill referred to earlier, the logistics projects, and so it will be over the next several years. I would tell you, today, we're probably at maybe a capacity of about 325,000 barrels per day for distillate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess kind of taking on with some of the other questions that have been asked, if we look at the light-heavy spread along the Gulf Coast, and this came up on the last call, you kind of believed an 8% discount between the lights and the heavy sours. If we look at LLS, we've kind of stayed in that line, if we look at Brent, it's clearly blown out quite considerably. What is, at this point, given that there aren't much in the way of light barrels being imported to the Gulf Coast, which one is the better indicator? And how do you work around that if LLS is the barrel, but, I guess, you would say the refined products are being priced off of Brent still?","S. Eugene Edwards","Yes, that's -- we look at Brent as being the benchmark -- this is Gene again, Roger. Brent as being the benchmark, so then you've got 2 components to your margin. You got your feedstock discounts. We're really not running any Brent, obviously. So if you're at Brent today, we've got an LLS discount. It's in the $7 range, and then you add your crack to it. And on medium sours, they're probably more in the $14 range. So you think about a medium sour at Brent, $14, $15, but LLS, it's $7, $8. So it's a -- they're very good numbers, which is kind of what we've been saying all along. A lot of people were concerned that LLS would get cheap, and it would sell cheaper than medium sours. Well, clearly, it's not happening. We're seeing pressure on the medium sours as well.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And as you start to move forward on moving more barrels from the Texas Coast to, say, Eastern Canada or wherever else they may eventually go, I mean, what -- how long before we would see an impact then on kind of Gulf Coast prices having to come up, obviously, reflect whatever the transportation costs are, but come up and kind of meet more of a global price issue? I mean, is that -- can we move enough barrels to Canada? Is there an appetite, let's just say, from the Gulf Coast to get the permits from the Department of Commerce to make that happen?","S. Eugene Edwards","Right. Well, first of all, the arb light we were talking about earlier to Canada is wide open for our facility, and we mentioned, too, that the competitors up there sometimes are medium sour. So they're going to be looking at light sweet in the Gulf Coast. But they're still going to be looking at medium sours, and medium sours are starting to be discounted on an international basis to compete in the Gulf Coast. So they'll have to optimize based on that. You also see the arbitrage at current pricing that you could use a U.S. wide vessel and take crude up to the East Coast refineries. But there's limited amounts of these U.S. wide vessels available. So right now, I'm not sure it does get solved in the short term. I think all these barrels are competing against each other. There's more crude than the market needs in the U.S., but there are market pressures to try to solve them. But there's limitations on all those. So -- and on top of that, you've got more and more domestic sweet being produced every day. I mean, the Bakken numbers, the Eagle Ford numbers, the Permian numbers just keep ramping up month after month. So it's -- I'm not sure exactly how the situation gets solved right now.","Joseph W. Gorder","Well, Roger, just to add to Gene's point, we've got the production coming on stream, but it was just this last week that Longhorn started running now at higher rates. I think they are up to 225,000. They were running between 90,000 and 170,000, I think, for some period of time. And then when MarketLink comes on stream later this year, you're going to have another significant slog of these barrels moving out of the Mid-Continent into the Gulf. So the pressure continues to build. As Gene said, higher production, more takeaway capacity out of the Mid-Continent to the Gulf. It's just going to continue to build.","S. Eugene Edwards","And, obviously, the rail economics from the Bakken area to the Coast is wide open as well. So there's a lot of market pressures to try to correct this. The big question is, is there enough of it to really solve it? We don't think there is right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen and Company.","Sam Margolin - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping to touch on the light oil units you guys are building in the Gulf Coast. I know it's pretty far out, but if there's anything you could share about sort of current pricing, feedstock replacement, differentials that are maybe off benchmark right now that can help us get a better picture of the economics once those start running and help us model it out.","Ashley M. Smith","So Sam, the premise behind these -- there are a couple of kind of toppers at specific units that leverage some other infrastructure at those plants. We're not just doing crude expansions. We're doing it to fill up some downstream units that are currently importing feedstocks. So that's basically it. But it's too soon to give out details, to model it, specifically. We're still evaluating the cases, evaluating the investment needed and the various margins that are going to drive it. So we think they look good but still evaluating. So too soon to get into model specifics.","Sam Margolin - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Well, maybe this is a little more near-term. In the past, you've talked about the West Coast. Those assets have been up for review a couple of times. It was obviously a really tough quarter out there this past period. And I was wondering if you could shed any light on the way you're thinking about that asset base now. I don't know, maybe the MLP changes things in terms of what's out there to drop down and remonetize. You might not want to lose it. But what's your latest thinking on that region?","William R. Klesse","Well, it's obvious that we're not making a lot of income or cash flow in the West Coast. And so we're looking at our options and continue to look at them from improved operations. Benicia this year hasn't run very well for the whole year, working there. We work on our cost structure. I think you know we have a rail facility planned at Benicia to run these sweet crudes, domestic crudes, but now we're stuck into an environmental review -- or I guess it's an assessment. And so now that project slipped on us. Where we thought we'd have it done at the end of this year, it's probably the end of next year. So these are the -- we're doing a lot of different things to try to improve our situation. But when you get all said and done with that conversation, PADD V, if we broadened the focus is just long refining capacity relative to product demand, which has not come close to recovering from the prerecession period. And so we just keep looking at all the -- all of the above.","Sam Margolin - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I mean, I think last year sort of demonstrated that region goes from long to short very quickly. Is there any resistance as far as rationalizing capacity there or it's all up to you?","William R. Klesse","I suppose you mean resistance being from politicians or somebody?","Sam Margolin - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","William R. Klesse","I'm sure there would be resistance. You saw what happened with Tesoro in Hawaii. So that would be. But the truth is, the whole PADD V seems to be 1 or 2 refineries long. So when 1 or 2 refineries go down, you make a lot of money.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions. Maybe this is for Gene. Gene, have you railed in any Bakken and WCS into any part of your system in the third quarter and how that looking in the fourth quarter?","William R. Klesse","Joe will answer you, Paul.","Joseph W. Gorder","Yes, Paul. Yes, absolutely. We have railed Bakken in, and we've railed heavy sour crudes in also. We've got bitumen that has gone into St. Charles, and we're probably doing 20 a day of that. And then the Bakken is actually -- I would tell you all of Memphis' volume is theoretically railed Bakken. It goes down to the U.S. Gulf Coast, to St. James, and then we bring it back up on Capline, but it's railed down there. And in Qu\u00e9bec, we started up the rail-loading facility, and that's going very well.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You must be [indiscernible] because the Brent and Bakken is like $25 discount on the wellhead. So you can get your hand on. I mean, how much is the total Bakken that you are running? Any rough estimate of that in the fourth quarter?","Joseph W. Gorder","Let me see. I'd tell you it's -- it was -- in the third quarter, it was 130 a day, and that's primarily Memphis volumes. It will increase -- I don't have the number of Bakken versus other crudes that we're going to be running at Qu\u00e9bec, so maybe another 40 or 50 on top of that.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So call it 200?","Joseph W. Gorder","I'll call it, sure, 180 to 200.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You must be extremely profitable on those. And, Joe, it looked like that the LLS delivery price is even lower that the spot at this point. So when people looking at [indiscernible], say, LLS 6321, it actually is underestimating the margin. Is it?","Joseph W. Gorder","Yes. It's very close, Paul, but it might be -- I don't know, it might be $1.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then a final one. When I'm looking at that sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter with the lower RIN price and looks like better wholesale margin, so far, quarter-to-date, is it safe for us to assume your margin capture weight [ph] in your system is actually better in the fourth quarter comparing to the third quarter?","Joseph W. Gorder","You're talking about just our income, Paul, specifically?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On your gross margin, that comparing to the benchmark, you guys provide in your website. Should we assume that the third quarter looked like may have hit the low point at least in the near term, and both quarters looked like it's much better?","Joseph W. Gorder","Right. And that's true. The lag effect in our crude pricing is going to give us better discounts going into the fourth quarter, and it's going to help our economics. I mean, they're significantly better. We saw a little bit of it in October, but we're seeing a lot more of it in November.","William R. Klesse","Yes. The point we're trying to make here, Paul, is you're asking, obviously, for a little guidance here. And what you would tell you is that October generally isn't that much than September. But because of the lag in the system for all us guys in this business, November and December look a lot better. So on a gross margin basis, fourth quarter does look better than the third quarter, but it's lag -- it's a lag.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Perfect. Joe, when I'm looking at your guidance, say, the RIN cost for the full year at $500 million to $600 million. This quarter, you have $75 million; second quarter, $125 million; third quarter, $185 million. So you're suggesting that the fourth quarter is still at $115 million to $215 million, given that the RIN cost seems to dropped down to the $0.30 comparing to the $0.80, $0.85 in the second and third quarter. Are we missing something or is that just that you're being conservative?","Joseph W. Gorder","No. Well, I'll tell you that the numbers I have don't really sync up with the numbers that you just stated. I would tell you that the number that we've got to achieve compliance is probably a lower number than you have.","Michael S. Ciskowski","The year -- Paul, this is Mike. The year-to-date number through September is $439 million. So to get to the $500 million -- the bottom end of the range, you're looking at $60 million.","Operator","And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Question for you on Meraux. I had seen some press reports suggesting there was a rupture at the crude unit, obviously, Ashley has already given us throughput guidance for 4Q. I'm just trying to confirm that there's no major issue or anything that we need to be aware of there.","Lane Riggs","This is Lane Riggs. [indiscernible] the crude's back in today. And we're going to be at full rates in about another 2 days. So in terms of forward guidance on throughputs, we're -- Ashley's numbers are fine.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Good deal.","William R. Klesse","I just want to be clear. It wasn't, per se, a rupture. We had -- we were doing maintenance work and we had a stopple, and the stopple didn't hold. And that's what happened. So we didn't have a piece of pipe just break this up. We were doing maintenance work, in which we're looking at our procedures in tremendous detail here as to how that could have happened.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, got it. The second question was on the unloading facility at Qu\u00e9bec. I'm trying to see if we can kind of help quantify maybe the potential shift in feedstock. Do you have any kind of clarity you could provide or ways to think about maybe the cost of transporting up there via rail and maybe the discounts you're getting? Any kind of color you could provide will be helpful.","Joseph W. Gorder","Blake, this is Joe. Now you know I can't tell you everything you want to know here, right? But I'll tell you, from a volumetric perspective, the rail facility was available to us in August. And in September, we started ramping up volumes a bit. I would tell you we might have run 15 a day of rail crude in September. By later this year, we will be running 50 a day of rail crude. We've got it set up now so we can take 100-car strings, which is a block, which basically kind of gives you a unit train operation, which is kind of the best economics that we can achieve on this. You know what the rail cost is to the East Coast out of these producing regions in Western Canada. And the rail cost into Qu\u00e9bec is cheaper. So I would tell you, if you wanted to use $10 to $12 a barrel, you could probably use that. And you can see what the discounts are for Bakken and the Syncrude over in that market and kind of come up with what the benefit might like look like right now. So in addition to the rail crudes we've got going in there, then we also then we have the waterborne crudes. And I've said earlier, we're moving [indiscernible] -- we're actually moving Eagle Ford and Bakken crudes up there. And we expect that we'll be doing somewhere around 50 a day by the end of the year, so 45 to 50 a day. So we're getting a lot of North American crude into the Qu\u00e9bec refinery. And then, we had a call yesterday with our Canadian guys and discussed the status of Line 9. And it looks like everything's going well and the project is progressing. We're encouraged by the fact that some of the reviews, for example, in Ontario, they were going to review the project on an independent basis. They've canceled that review. So everybody seems to be getting more comfortable with that pipe. And at that point in time, we'll probably be running all North -- when that line comes up, we'll be running all North American crude, and Qu\u00e9bec will back out to foreign barrels.","William R. Klesse","Blake, this is Bill Klesse, and so this even goes back to Paul's question or maybe I'm trying to manage expectations a little here. There is no question running domestic crude oil or North American crude oil is very advantageous. And we give up on some of that by the costs. But clearly, shipping from the Gulf Coast to Canada is a couple of bucks; the rail, it's in our handout, we have all those rates in there. So I'd say all of this is extremely profitable. On the other side though, the gasoline crack still isn't really that good. Actually, it's crummy. Butane -- we make a lot of other stuff besides just diesel and gasoline and jet. And a lot of those markets are weak. So yes, the crude is clearly an advantage, but some of the other products are not contributing here. So I'm just trying to manage it because I could see with your question, Paul's question -- yes, it's better than it was in the third quarter, but there are things that are negative.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So yes, just coming back to the crude side, I mean, obviously great conditions down in the Gulf at the moment. Are you seeing from, say, some of the medium importers sort of 1.5 million barrels a day comes into the Gulf and I appreciate you're more heavy. But are you seeing some of those medium imports? I'm thinking mainly the Middle East start to try and redirect the cargoes. I mean, how do you think that's going to pan out with the growing supply that's coming down the pipes?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Ed, I don't know. I mean, I don't know that we've seen Middle Eastern cargoes redirected. I know we haven't.","S. Eugene Edwards","No, we haven't. They're really priced [indiscernible] index, which is a complicated dollar. So their prices are based on U.S. basis. But do they have better opportunities to move over to Asia and we haven't really...","William R. Klesse","Historically they have, right?","S. Eugene Edwards","They always have, yes. Still a lot of barrels that needs to clear to the Gulf Coast to put [ph] in those market.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I mean, I guess just thinking about the $8 spread at the moment between, I guess, LLS, is the only decent benchmark we have. How has that changed your thinking about the sort of, I guess, the industry expectations, say, a year ago of sort of $2 to $5 as being the sort of right kind of discount to sort of encourage those to move to other markets?","S. Eugene Edwards","This is Gene, again. When the market gets oversupplied, it's hard to really pick the right number. Why did WTI, the breadth [ph] go to $25 last year? So when it's oversupplied -- so $2 to $5, I mean, to me, fundamentally, is no different than $8. It's just a matter of where the market shakes out. The market is clearly long. It's hard to say what the right number is.","William R. Klesse","So we think -- we still stay to our position that things will eventually evolve to transportation costs. But you have to have what Gene just said, you have to have adequate ways of -- adequate capacity in the transportation area. And until you get that, and what Gene said, what is the number? And yes, are we a little surprised it's blown up this much? Of course we are. But I think, long term -- for long term, it doesn't really change our thinking.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The -- switching to that idea of transport, I mean, obviously $1.5 billion, I think, is your CapEx for strategic and, obviously, a chunk of that is methanol, but a chunk of that is going to be on the logistics. Could you give us sort of an update on what type of -- I'm thinking, to make it simple, EV\/EBITDA that you're investing at. I mean, Obviously, we know the MLPs trade at the high multiples. But what sort of returns do you think you're getting on your organic logistic investments?","Ashley M. Smith","Ed, this is Ashley. We don't have returns for each project. And then you can slice these different ways because, does the refinery get the benefit? Or does the railcar get the benefit? There's a lot of ways you could look at it. And then how will that return then go in. If it was going -- that asset was going to go into a logistics partnership, where do you put the return? Directionally, they're all beneficial. Most of them are pretty high-return projects, especially because they're bringing advantaged crude to refineries. But giving specific returns by each dock, by each railcar, we're not going to provide.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I'm just fishing to try and help us, say, get an estimate of how much logistics EBITDA you'll have down the road after you've spent a lot of this capital.","William R. Klesse","And it's a fair question. Part of the problem is what Ashley said. The other piece of it is we're very convinced the future in this business, just strategically, is you've got to be able to move stuff around; you got to be able to load ships. And so some of these projects, like our dock at Corpus Christi, we just say we got to have it. The docks at Saint Charles, building a new dock over there maybe, the dock at Port Arthur. We're just saying this is the way the future has to be, just like some of our competitors are saying the same thing. With the MLP, obviously, you have a cost structure that permits them to be dropped at a reasonable rate. So it all fits together, we think, as a management team, very well. But it's hard for us to tell you, as Ashley said, this project yields that, this project yield that. But they're all going to be above cost of capital and they are all going to fit very nicely in this portfolio.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I mean, maybe, one final thing then. Is there a constraint on moving even faster in terms of growing these logistics or spending more money in that area?","William R. Klesse","I don't see us doing that. So I guess it's just our capability to do things. And we think we're doing the right projects now that work on our strategy. So it's not -- we've given you guidance for next year, and that's the guidance we're sticking with.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I have a couple of questions. First, the capture rate seemed a little bit low in relation to Q3 of years past. And so I think we've talked about how it's going to rebound. But just wanted to see if there were any color you could provide into those results. And then second, this morning, BP highlighted normal seasonal factors. And I think growth compared to capacity is the driver of weakness in global gross margins recently, meaning, exclusive of the positive feedstock points that Ashley, Gene and Joe made about Valero's system in the United States. And so this might be a question for Bill, but I just wanted to see whether you think the recent weakness in global margins is seasonal, cyclical or both? And also whether or not there are any other issues that may help to explain some of these recent global trends?","Ashley M. Smith","Doug, let me start with your capture rate stuff. I'll give a couple of generalities because everyone models differently and has got different assumptions. So it's hard to reconcile subjective stuff like that on an earnings call. But key factors that aren't in a typical indicator are RINs costs, not everyone captures butanes and naphthas and things like that. And those had wild depressed swings in the third quarter that impacted what you would normally see in prior periods when those weren't a factor. Those are probably the biggest ones probably across the entire industry. So -- but any other detail, we'd have to do it one-on-one, because that's [indiscernible] on your model.","S. Eugene Edwards","And Doug, this is Gene. On the global margins, I guess the way we view it is with the new capacity coming on in Saudi and some of the Chinese refineries, that there is going to be pressure on certain refineries in the world to kind of make room for that. And I think that includes some of the Asian refineries in Japan and Korea and Australia, some of those have been rationalizing. And also in Europe because Europe is going to have to make room for not only the U.S. exports but the new Saudi refinery exports and Europe's only advantage is limited to distillate demand and that could be supplied cheaper from other sources. So we think global margins are off a little bit if you kind of look at past 2011, 2012 margins. '13 margins are a little weak or are definitely weaker as you're moving into the fourth quarter. So I guess we could say that pattern continues to next year. And I don't think margin is going to be so bad as they are right now in the fourth quarter, where every refinery in Europe loses money. I mean, that's too far, right? So it's somewhere you'll get some bounce back, but I think you'll see weaker margins in Europe than we have over the last couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You gave us the product export numbers, which Bill, you said in the past, is really the key to the whole bull case here, given the weakness of U.S. demand. I was interested that you've got more capacity to export seemingly, or correct me if you don't. But given the weakness of, as you said, crummy gasoline cracks, I was wondering why more -- why there wasn't more export, if you like, or what the constraint was on exports and I understand you also said that exports -- less [ph] exports are up this quarter.","Joseph W. Gorder","Yes. This is Joe, Paul. So economics dictate a lot of our export volume. And so we take into consideration not only the margin that we can get on the barrel that's going out but also then the RIN effect. And clearly in the third quarter, that would have encouraged exports to be as aggressive as possible. The distillate export volume we had was very much what we expect. It is going up significantly in October. And again, with the arb being open to Europe, we're going to see that be much stronger I think in the fourth quarter. The gasoline exports, we moved most of that volume out of our Corpus Christi refinery, and a lot of it's termed up and went into Mexico and some of it went into South America. But that is part of our business that as we look at it going forward, we're very focused on expanding. And so strategically, we have initiatives that we have underway to try to create additional opportunities for ourselves to move those barrels out. But it wasn't there yet today. So even though we've got capacity to export, you've got to have a market to move it into and there's got to be demand for it. And so we moved as much as we could economically move, versus the alternative.","Michael S. Ciskowski","Yes, it's all versus the alternative, Paul. After netbacks and different grades in those different markets. So just -- we're constantly optimizing around that.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But I guess what you're saying is that diesel is great, right? You can export it with the RINs [indiscernible] RINs to Europe and so that's maxed out. On gasoline, the alternative is a different -- as a competitor, essentially. Is that what you're saying, that has a lower price than you?","William R. Klesse","I think what we're going to say to you is you're optimizing the refinery to make distillates. Even our distillates are up. And it's not necessarily that we're sparing the cats [ph], but if you look at our operating rates, our operating rates in the whole industry have been -- with the turnarounds that Gene mentioned earlier, have been very good. So operating rates are okay. They've come down some on crude units, but generally they're okay. And so we're making the product slate that maximizes our profit on the back end of the refinery. And so then we have this gasoline. We place it in the domestic market. And some has to go out of the country. As Joe said, some are from our refinery in Corpus Christi. But we're not necessarily sparing gasoline units. But the gasoline margin is poor. So we're optimizing to jet diesel on those strings.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I get that and it's...","William R. Klesse","I know you do.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I think -- I just -- to go back to kind of what Joe said, just to reclarify, the -- can you kind of go over again why there's not more gasoline export, Joe? Sorry, I know you kind of answered. But if you could just totally clarify it for me.","Michael S. Ciskowski","Where [ph] would the next 50,000 barrels of gasoline go at? Would it be a loss or would it be marginal economics? That's basically the question. And...","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And that would be set by the bid from a buyer abroad?","William R. Klesse","That's right.","Michael S. Ciskowski","And netbacks and shipping.","Joseph W. Gorder","And Paul, remember, I think we had shipping rates that were very high during the third quarter. I think we were $0.115 a gallon versus like $0.075 in Europe or $0.07 today. So there are a lot of factors that come into play. But again, it's economics.","William R. Klesse","Let me add a little side conversation here. So we obviously have export capability. So then it turns into either quality or the refinery economics. And as we run our economics in the refinery, basically we're always in balance, right? Because you adjust operating rate. So we didn't find it attractive to make more gasoline. So I mean it's because of the economics. If the economics for gasoline had been really strong, we would have figured out how make more gasoline.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Just to clarify...","William R. Klesse","And that is the answer. The economics in the refinery didn't drive us to make more gasoline, then the marketing groups dispose of it to the best way they can.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I get it. Just -- I think -- did you say that your export capacity is now 350, because we were running with a 280 number. And if I add the 193 plus the 91 -- the 193 distillate plus the 91 gasoline, I get obviously to 284. But then I think you said your capacity to export was actually 350 or am I wrong?","Joseph W. Gorder","I said gasoline, we would say that our gasoline export capabilities, logistically is 225. And logistically, on diesel, it's 325 today. So the point, I guess, Paul, we're not logistically constrained. It goes back to Bill's point about economics.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. That's exactly what I was trying to get at. Yes, I think I get it. I think it's all an Atlantic basin thing that we're going to have to think about, right. And the RINs you're referring to, obviously, is European RINs, right? In terms of export...","Joseph W. Gorder","No, U.S. RIN.","William R. Klesse","No, this -- we're talking about the RINs, the cost of RINs. So in the U.S., when we sell product to the U.S., we're the obligated party. When you export, you don't have that obligation. So Joe is telling you that works into the math.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. I know to take this off-line, but I'm getting there, it's just so important, obviously, to the outlook, how much we can export and how much we can grow that going forward. Just separately, the DD&A jumped up, even with high utilization, high throughputs, DD&A per barrel jumped up. Is there anything you can add on that?","William R. Klesse","Yes, Paul. Yes, it was up about $40 million from the prior quarter. And it relates to accelerated depreciation that we took on some of our logistics assets, as we were finalizing the financial statements for the MLP. And then we also had Saint Charles hydrocracker startup. So we had added depreciation from that project.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So that's not going to be an ongoing? That's not -- we don't, obviously, forecast that to keep growing at that rate?","William R. Klesse","No, no, no. The guidance I think Ashley gave was 425. So it's going to be about $30 million less than what the third quarter was.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","I got a question back on the cost advantage crudes. And in your latest presentation, you have a slide showing the Gulf Coast -- well you got -- you have advantage crudes processed by region. And I was just noticing your Gulf Coast capacity, it looks like it's -- first quarter, second quarter this year is around 320,000 -- maybe 325,000 barrels a day. Do you have that same metric for the third quarter?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Let me see -- capacity -- yes, it's about the same. It was a running -- we estimated capacity to process like light crudes was in 2Q, around 280,000, 290,000. We estimate it's up around 310,000 now for third quarter.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Okay. So are you maxed out in the Gulf Coast at this point on the advantage crudes until Corpus and Houston, those projects come on, or are there just more opportunities to kind of tweak the volumes higher in the meantime?","Lane Riggs","Chi, this is Lane. We still have the opportunity to optimize the domestic sweets versus really, I would say, medium sour imports. And so we haven't entirely used all of our capacity yet to put these domestic crudes into our refineries. We still have some capacity left but -- even beyond these key projects we're looking at.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Lane, do have estimate [ph] on volumes on how much more you can kind of optimize towards?","Lane Riggs","Our capacity right now is around 415,000 barrels a day to run these crudes.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","In the Gulf?","Lane Riggs","In the Gulf.","S. Eugene Edwards","Remember you're displacing medium sours in some of this, though, that we still have better economic [indiscernible] than medium sours. So that's the reason we're only running the 310,000 versus the 400,000 capacities, because we still have better economics on the mediums.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Right. I guess second question back on this RIN issue, Bill, do have any comment on this supposed leaked EPA document? And really, what is the outlook on your end into 2014 and what the mandate might look at. And have you had any discussions with regulators or the administration lately and any feel for how they're talking about next year?","Joseph W. Gorder","Chi, this is Joe. I think the answer to all your questions is yes. I mean, obviously, the leaked information, along with the other things that the EPA has said, have led to the decline in RIN prices. They recognize clearly the blend wall is an issue and they said they are going to address it. They extended the deadline for compliance from 2013 to June '14. And then the leaked memo comes out, it has of the significant reduction in 2014's statutory levels to what they've proposed in '14. Now, that being said, none of us know if this is true or not. But it certainly had the effect of taking the pressure off of the RIN market and that's why we saw a drop from the mid $1.40 to $0.20 or sub $0.20 today. So if we look out, I mean, the EPA gave us a short-term release, if we look out, there has been a lot of activity on the legislative front. And there are many bipartisan groups that are working on amendments, rewrites, essentially, of the RFS. And they're kind of across the continuum as you would expect. Although we think it's poor legislation and it should be repealed, it's really much more probable that it gets amended and it becomes palatable, and it puts the RINs where they should be, which is a compliance tool and not something that economically affects compliance with the RFS. Bill's had many meetings on this in D.C. and other places. And I've had one also. And so we continue to work the issue. And we do think that we're going to get some relief in '14 and hopefully, longer-term, with legislative relief.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Okay. So do you think these legislative actions on the rewrites, I mean, does EPA kind of -- do they just short circuit that effort by just kind of taking the rug out of 2014? And is this just going to be just a year-by-year kind of rolling uncertainty as we go into RFS for the following year? Or do you really believe there will be a rewrite at some point on the RFS?","Joseph W. Gorder","Okay. So first of all, I think the EPA did what they could and then acted within their authority to do what they needed to do for '13, '14, okay? But looking out, I do think that there's enough attention on this issue that you are going to get a legislative fix. I'm hopeful that you are and there are a lot of people working it. So I expect that we're going to see something. I'm not sure when it will be. It certainly won't be this year. But hopefully, we see it sometime in the early to mid part of next year.","Ashley M. Smith","Chi, it's Ashley. I want to clarify on your first question. I was just talking about the light crude capacities and what we're processing. So when you add in the Canadian stuff and this better matches that chart you were referring in the appendix of our slide deck, it has been improving. 1Q was 331,000 a day -- this is all Gulf Coast, 331,000 a day, 2Q is 336,000, 3Q is 346,000. It's mostly light but we're getting some advantaged Canadian heavier stuff, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Allen Good of MorningStar.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wonder if I could just come back to the export issue and to get your thoughts on the market, maybe a bit longer term. It would seem that every refiner, including yourselves, are betting on maintaining high utilization through exports. As a result, you're building out export capacity. But if we look at the U.S., it seems like the oversupply will be in gasoline. If you think about globally, it seems like Europe will bear the brunt of the refinery closures, and that's not really a gasoline market. So I'm just wondering, where do you see that extra demand for gasoline coming from, given it seems like gasoline exports will need to increase over the next few years. Is it simply a fact of increasing demand in Latin America? Or do you think you can grow markets elsewhere? And then more importantly, how do you think Valero maintains its market share of exports, considering your peers are really jumping into the export market with additional capacity as well?","S. Eugene Edwards","Okay, this is Gene. As far as Europe not importing gasoline, you're right, they don't. But they do export a lot of gasoline when they run the refineries full out. So I think when you get the rationalization in Europe, they all reduce their gasoline exports in places like West Africa and Latin America to make room for the U.S. barrels, which have a big cost advantage.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And so -- and then what do you think as far as -- with peers increasing as well, do you think there will be enough of that lost supply from Europe really to accommodate all U.S. refiners who are looking to export more product?","Joseph W. Gorder","Well, it's more than just Europe. We talked a little earlier about the whole global market. There's also refineries going down in Australia, Korea, Japan, the European refineries. Anyone that has disadvantaged crude without a market. Some of the -- if you're importing crude, exporting products in Europe on LNG, gas -- natural gas. You're pretty much disadvantaged and those are the refineries that will make room for the more competitive refineries.","William R. Klesse","And gasoline demand in Latin America, you've got population growth, you've got economies growing, you've got increased demand, and you've got operations that, historically, anyway, have not been very good. And Mexico, they have decent operations but structurally, they're short gasoline, and they continue to grow. Venezuela's had significant refinery operating issues in the Caribbean, which have affected gasoline supply, and which I don't if it will get resolved anytime soon. So although I think Gene's comments on Europe are right. And I also think we're fairly comfortable that with low cost, efficient refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the natural resources advantages that we're enjoying there, we're going to be able to continue to be very competitive exporters, not only to Europe but also to Latin America.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then if I could just come back to capital spending, I guess a couple of years ago, it was assumed once the hydrocrackers were completed, that you'd see capital spending fall? Clearly, you mentioned earlier that the market's presenting a lot of opportunities for you to continue to reinvest in the business. If we were to assume that current market conditions hold going forward, do you think your queue of potential projects is deep enough, where we could assume that this $1.5 billion on growth will continue and maybe the $3 billion total for capital spending would be a safe run rate over the next few years? Or do you expect you'll extinguish some of these current opportunities over the next 1 or 2 years, where we'll see capital spending maybe fall back down once we get 3 or 4 years out?","William R. Klesse","Well, we're only giving the guidance for '14. But a big part of the '14 spending is logistics and those projects get completed. And so as they fall off, it remains to be seen. But we think part of our job is to add shareholder value and there are these opportunities. But we are not -- we're not just saying, hey, capital spending is going up, up, up. What we did is we raised our '14 guidance basically $0.5 billion to $3 billion, because really a lot of logistics stuff we're trying to get done. And a lot of it does get done next year.","Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. If I could just, one quick follow-up. I guess share repurchases fell off in the third quarter. It seems like on your run rate for the fourth, you're back to about, call it, a little bit less than $300 million per quarter. Should we assume that run rate going forward until you extinguish the $3 billion? Or would you look to potentially add to the $3 billion once we get closer to the end or extinguishment of that debt level?","Ashley M. Smith","Allen, this is Ashley. We don't have guidance on how much specific buyback activity we're going to do going forward, except that we do consider that a priority return of cash to shareholders along with a recurring dividend. But we won't provide specific guidance.","Joseph W. Gorder","But just to reiterate what Ashley said in his comments, we spent $675 million buying our shares this year. We raised our dividends. Our dividend's going to approach, I think, $400 million on an annual rate. So that's over $1 billion and we spun off CST. So this management team, for any of the people that are still on the call, this management team has been very focused on returning value to the shareholder.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matt Carter-Tracy of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Carter-Tracy - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one additional question on crude exports. I know you addressed the product export constraints in some depth. But I'm curious as you're looking at both railing Bakken crude into Qu\u00e9bec and also shipping Eagle Ford crude by tanker, if there are actually any logistical strengths [ph] that would keep you from shipping more Gulf Coast crude to Qu\u00e9bec if the differentials became favorable to doing that?","Joseph W. Gorder","Well, on the water there aren't, because we're supplying Quebec on the water today with foreign light sweet crude. So, they certainly wouldn't be on the water. On the rail side, think we're probably going to be maxed out somewhere around 55,000 [ph] barrels a day. But then we're also going to be a shipper on Line 9. And so, those barrels will deliver in -- on the water, but they'll come from Canada. So I would say no.","William R. Klesse","So Joe said that earlier that once all those projects you just mentioned get finished and we said it on previous calls that the Qu\u00e9bec refinery is going to evolve into a North American crude-supplied refinery where it used to be 100% foreign, But you'll still have this economic opportunity because you have the hardware. But over the next year, we're still importing crude into Qu\u00e9bec. And we've told you guys in the past, we run Saharan [ph] out of Algeria, CPC [ph]. So that means there's probably some West African thrown in there. So they're running out the whole 240,000 barrels a day or so of our capacity there. For the next year, we'll still be an importer of crude because you do wind up with some refining hardware capability here. Eagle Ford is very paraffinic. It gives the whole industry problems in the crude heater. So we -- you do wind up with some processing limitations, which then we all try to address here through hardware. But for the next year, we're still going to run from foreign crude there.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.

My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Ashley Smith, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Smith, you may begin.","Ashley M. Smith","Thank you, John. Good morning. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer; Joe Gorder, Executive Vice President and President of European Operations; Kim Bowers, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Jean Bernier, Executive Vice President.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached in the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.","Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael S. Ciskowski","Thanks, Ashley, and thank you all for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported fourth quarter 2011 income from continuing operations of $45 million, or $0.08 per share. This number includes an after-tax benefit of approximately $161 million, or $0.29 per share, from a year end LIFO inventory decrement.","Our fourth quarter 2011 operating income was $167 million versus operating income of $378 million in the fourth quarter of '10. Our fourth quarter refining throughput margin was $5.46 per barrel, which is a 25% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of '10. The decrease in throughput margins compared to the fourth quarter of '10 was due to lower margins for gasoline and petrochemical feedstocks, plus reduced discounts for medium and heavy sour feedstocks such as Mars and Maya crude oils. These declines were partially offset by higher margins for diesel.","In the fourth quarter of '11, Gulf Coast gasoline margins per barrel versus LLS decreased 185% to a negative $2.05 from a positive $2.42 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Gulf Coast ULSD margins per barrel versus LLS increased 39% from $9.88 in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $13.71 in the fourth quarter of '11. So far in the first quarter of 2012, Gulf Coast margins have moved higher, averaging over $5.50 per barrel for gasoline and about $16 per barrel for ULSD.","The Maya heavy sour crude oil discounts versus LLS decreased 44% from $12.75 in the fourth quarter of '10 to $7.19 per barrel in the fourth quarter of '11. The Maya discount has narrowed some in the first quarter, with the average down to around $4.50 per barrel.","The WTI crude discount versus LLS increased over $13 per barrel from $3.34 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2010 to $16.70 per barrel in the fourth quarter of '11, which helped improve throughput margins in our Mid-Continent region from the fourth quarter of '10 to the fourth quarter of '11.","Our fourth quarter 2011 refinery throughput volume averaged to 2.7 million barrels per day, up 523,000 barrels per day from the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase in throughput volumes was mainly the addition of capacity from the acquisition of Pembroke and Meraux refineries, plus operating the Aruba Refinery, which was not in operation during the fourth quarter of 2010.","Refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter of '11 were $3.92 per barrel, which was higher than the third quarter of 2011 and our guidance, mainly due to costs of a legal settlement, plus higher regulatory and tax expense.","Our Ethanol segment reported its best quarter on record with $181 million of operating income, which was up $111 million from the fourth quarter of 2010 and up $74 million from the third quarter of 2011, mainly due to much higher gross margins. For the full year of 2011, our Ethanol segment reported operating income of $396 million, its best year ever. In addition, since we bought the first 2 plants in 2009 through the end of 2011, we estimate that in less than 3 years, our Ethanol business has generated cumulative pretax cash flow exceeding the purchase price and recovering our $750 million investment. As good as the fourth quarter was for Ethanol, I should point out though that Ethanol margins declined significantly in December, and it remained low so far in the first quarter.","Our Retail segment reported fourth quarter operating income of $83 million, consisting of $48 million in U.S. and $35 million in Canada. For the full year 2011, our Retail segment reported their most profitable year ever, with $381 million in operating income, which includes a record high from our Canadian retail, with $168 million in operating income.","In the fourth quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $129 million, which was below third quarter 2011 and our guidance, mainly due to favorable legal settlements. Depreciation and amortization expense was $393 million, and net interest expense was $89 million. The effective tax rate on continuing operations in the fourth quarter was 52%, which is higher than our guidance rate of 36% due to the combination of year-end tax adjustments and low pretax income. ","Regarding cash flows in the fourth quarter, capital spending was $899 million, which includes $128 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. For the full year of 2011, Valero's total capital spending, including turnaround and catalyst expenditures, was $3 billion, or $200 million below the previous guidance of $3.2 billion. Our expected capital spending for 2012 is consistent with previous guidance at around $3.4 billion.","Also in the fourth quarter, we paid $84 million in dividends and $79 million to purchase 3.5 million shares of our common stock. We also spent $547 million to acquire the Meraux Refinery and related logistics assets, which included approximately $219 million for inventory.","With respect to our balance sheet at the end of December, total debt was $7.7 billion, cash was $1 billion, and our debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 29%. At the end of the fourth quarter, we also had nearly $4.5 billion of additional liquidity available.","As to our refining operations in the fourth quarter, we completed the hydrogen plants at Memphis and McKee, which were 2 of our key economic projects. Start-up is underway at Memphis, and we are planning to start up the McKee plant in February. These projects are designed to take advantage of the large spread between natural gas and crude oil prices, which is very valuable given that natural gas is only trading at 15% to 20% of the price of oil on an energy equivalent basis.","Our 2 hydrocracker projects at Port Arthur and St. Charles remain on budget and on time for completion in the second half of 2012. These projects were designed to capitalize on high crude oil and low natural gas prices while producing diesel and gasoline to meet growing global demand.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.","Ashley M. Smith","Thanks, Mike. For modeling our first quarter operations, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: the Gulf Coast at 1.38 million to 1.42 million barrels per day; the Mid-Continent at 390,000 to 400,000 barrels per day; the West Coast at 220,000 to 230,000 barrels per day; and the North Atlantic at 450,000 to 460,000 barrels per day. The lower throughput volumes in our Gulf Coast and West Coast regions are due to substantial turnaround activities planned for this quarter, particularly at our St. Charles and Wilmington refinery. A listing of our planned turnaround activities was posted this morning to our website under the News Room.","Refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter are expected to be around $4.50 per barrel, which is higher than last quarter due mainly to lower throughput volumes and some higher maintenance cost related to the turnaround activity.","Regarding our Ethanol operations in the first quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.5 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average approximately $0.34 per gallon, including $0.03 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to some of the other items for the first quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $160 million; net interest expense should be around $85 million; total depreciation and amortization expense should be around $400 million; and our effective tax rate should be approximately 36%.","Okay, John, that concludes our opening statements. We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Mike mentioned in his opening remarks that Refining margins have improved versus Q4. And on this point, I wanted to see if you could provide your view on product balances in the Atlantic basin over the immediate term, meaning while demand has not been great and capacity growth was pretty significant during the second half of '11, the next couple of quarters appear to be more promising, especially with the closures announced in recent months. And so I just wanted to see if you could provide your perspective on the demand and the supply sides of the equation for the basin in coming quarters? And also, update us on the status of Aruba, too?","Joseph W. Gorder","Okay. Well, Doug, this is Joe. I mean, I'll speak for a minute to the gasoline piece, then somebody else can speak to Aruba. But obviously, with what's happened in the marketplace from a supply perspective, things look encouraging. You've got plant closures in the Northeast U.S., you've got the situation with Petro Plus in Europe. We have Hovensa making announcements. Isla still is running well. So from a supply perspective, products tend to be a bit tighter than they have been. If you look at U.S. gasoline demand, of course it's not particularly strong. But the real story in gasoline continues to be the export markets, where year-to-date through December, we exported 511,000 barrels a day of gasoline, which is up 175,000 from the previous year. So that continues to look good. Now will it continue? I think it probably will. You've got Latin America growing, and they continue to import. Venezuela still has issues at their domestic refineries. And then they're involved of course with Isla and Hovensa. Mexico gasoline imports were up to 405,000 barrels a day, and Petrobras continues to pool gasoline. So if you look at the gasoline markets in general, I think that we're going to continue to see very strong demand, and our export business should continue to be strong. On the distillate side again, you have just average distillate markets here in the U.S., but their exports were also very strong. The industry exported almost 850,000 barrels a day. So that continues, and the same refinery issues that are affecting gasoline are out there for diesel also. The heart [ph] to Europe, which was closed a little bit earlier this year, is now open again, and so we're seeing barrels move that way. Our exports for the quarter were 65,000 barrels a day of gasoline and slightly over 180,000 barrels a day of diesel fuel. So that continues to be good for us. So I hope that answers your question.","William R. Klesse","Concerning Aruba, Doug, we continue to look at our strategic alternatives, but we're in the same boat as was announced by one of our competitors operating in the Caribbean. And so we intend to have a decision here very shortly here within the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","My question evolves around heavy sour discounts in Maya. You talked about Maya premiums being -- or discounts being soft in the first quarter. Lots of things influencing that. The K factor is moving around, resid inventories are low, which is propping up Maya pricing. You got Hovensa coming out of the market, and then eventually Seaway deliveries coming later in June. Could you talk about your expectation for Maya and heavy sours as we look through 2012?","Joseph W. Gorder","Jeff, I mean, this is Joe again. I think you cited on so many of the facts that are going to affect this market. I mean, right now, the discounts are weak. And as you've said, resid is very tight. We also had the compression of the WTI-Brent spread which -- where WTS moves with. And so as that came in, as with respect of the relative prices of WTS, so 80% of the Maya formula was affected by those 2 components. And as you mentioned the K factor, we saw the Mexicans adjust the K by $1.90 a month the last 2 months, and we expect them to continue to move that going forward. So although the discounts are weak today, I think our expectation is that we'll see discounts somewhere close to last year's levels, or slightly below as the year moves on.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","And secondly, you guys have been supporters of TransCanada's Keystone Pipeline, and that's experienced some government delays. Are you free to pursue whatever options are best in moving Canadian crude down to the Gulf Coast? Are you considering both TransCanada Keystone and Enbridge? Or are you focused on one or the other more intently?","Joseph W. Gorder","Well, Jeff, we continue to be big supporters of Keystone. We think it's a great project, and we're committed to that pipeline. That being said, we have a strong appetite for heavy sour crudes in the Gulf Coast. And we're watching the other projects as they develop. Obviously, we've got Enbridge and Enterprise that have one project in place. We've got an open season now on another pipeline that would parallel the Seaway project. It runs from [indiscernible] south, the Cushing and then on down to the Gulf Coast. And we support all of these projects that would bring additional crudes into the Gulf.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, on the call, signaling higher payouts and rising free cash flow, maybe just give us some color about your thoughts about shareholder distributions? And then I have a follow-up.","William R. Klesse","We increased our dividend last year, and we bought shares in the fourth quarter. There's a few shares that carried over into the first quarter that we purchased because of settlement dates. But clearly, we will look at increasing our dividend, buying some of our shares as we complete our projects. Now first, we're going to maintain our investment-grade rating. Then we have the Port Arthur hydrocrackers should be done at the end of the second quarter, starting up in the third. And in the fourth quarter, we'd finish the one at St. Charles. So as these projects are getting completed, we'll look at how we manage our cash. The other thing that we have said when we've spoken to you all, as we look into '13, we expect our capital spending to fall from our $3.4 billion where we are today for 2012, down into $2.5 billion to the low $2 billion for next year.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Very helpful. Just a follow-on, separate area -- but you're actually making money in the North Atlantic even as everyone else closes around you. Given that you are able to make money from the assets that you've chosen to invest in, I mean, are you tempted to add more to the European refining portfolio if you can find a sort of similar advantaged assets as Pembroke?","William R. Klesse","We have a very good base in the U.K. and Ireland. So with all of the noise that's going on with some of the refineries that are available, yes, we would take a look at this. We say that about everything anyhow. But if you actually look at it, we want a very strong strategic fit. It needs to be compatible in the sense of moving streams between refineries. It needs to bring marketing or at least support our trading in the Atlantic basin and then the exports that Joe spoke about. So it has to have strategic or synergy value to us in fitting into an overall system. But obviously, we read the news and we see what's going on as well. And we have a good base there that we didn't have prior to our acquisition of Chevron's business.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And my interpretation of good base, is this correct, is that you could just stick with your current assets and therefore, the bar for any further acquisitions would have to be that much higher?","William R. Klesse","That would be absolutely right.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm going to try a couple of questions also, if I may. The first one, Bill, when you talk about your strategic options for Aruba, and obviously you brought in Europe to the discussion as well, can I ask you to bring us up to date with your thoughts on the West Coast, particularly as it alludes to the free cash flow in the West Coast as opposed to the earnings, specifically if you have continued the requirements for regulatory spending? Does that remain a core area in the perhaps redesign portfolio as you move forward? And I have a follow-up, please.","William R. Klesse","As of today, the West Coast is a very key part of our business. So you use the word core, it is a core asset for us. We have a good position there. We have very good operations. We have had to spend a lot of money at our Benicia refinery here for environmental. And that is true. But the thing that you cannot forget on the West Coast is they're still in a recession or a depression. They have unemployment headline number of 11%, little over that, which means underemployment is probably 2x that. TARP is absolutely out of control. They do not work for the common good, and they're hurting the economy in the West Coast. But for us now, we continue to work on our cost structure, we're attacking that. The refinery operations are reducing costs in that business, and we're in a competitive position. And we're well positioned there. But the macro is the problem, and it needs to be solved.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My follow-up is really more of a micro question on gasoline. We see how strong distillate cracks are, gasoline less so. You've announced your turnaround program which, if I'm not mistaken, looks like it's relatively heavy by historical standards. Could you maybe characterize how do you see the outlook for cleaning up gasoline inventories, the overhang that we have right now? And perhaps if you have a view as to how industry maintenance could perhaps help out over the next couple of months, that would be great. And I'll leave it there.","William R. Klesse","Well for us, these turnarounds have been scheduled. The one at St. Charles, Ashley said we put up our turnaround schedule on the web page. But these have been scheduled turnarounds. So St. Charles would be down for 66 days. In April, McKee goes down to do work on the cracker, which will reduce gasoline production up in the Texas Panhandle. So ours have been scheduled. Now there's no question that gasoline is sloppy, although, quite frankly, the cracks have improved significantly here just in the last couple of weeks. But part of the issue again is in North America and in Europe, we have growing but -- at least in North America -- growing but very slow economy. Europe, Western Europe, I don't know if they're technically in recession today or not. But you combine the uncertainty we have economically, we do have higher prices. We have in the U.S., this housing overhang. And remember, we sell fuels to everybody. And there's a large segment of our customer base who either is unemployed or facing economic uncertainty. So to me, we have to have people getting back to work and economic activity picking up, and we'll see demand recover. And I think we'll see higher demand this year than we had last year. And the turnarounds when we're down obviously reduced production, just as all the shutdowns that had been announced are doing. But I'm optimistic that gasoline's going to be fine this year, but we do need to get people back to work. Distillates is still doing just fine. And as Joe said, the orders [ph] open again in Europe. Economies around us are growing. And from our U.S. Gulf Coast business, we'll continue to export.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays Capital.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mike, can I ask some balance sheet data? In terms of working capital, the long-term debt of the total debt component and inventory market value in excess of both?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Sure, Paul. Our total current assets at the end of the year was at $16 billion. Total current liabilities was $12.7 billion. So our net working capital was $3.3 billion. Our market value in excess of LIFO was about $6.8 billion. Total debt at the end of the year was $7.7 billion. And our stockholders equity was $16.4 billion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mike, out of the $7.7 billion in total debt, how much is long-term debt?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Pretty much almost all of that is long-term debt. We did have $250 million that was under our AR program. And included in those numbers is about $45 million of capitalized leases.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, perfect. Bill or maybe both Bill and Mike, you're talking about that raising the dividend and maybe doing a bit of the share buyback and returning cash. And next year, your budget is at $2 billion, $2.5 billion, and locking on that, that's a January, a pretty substantial sum of free cash, with your DD&A already in the $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion. How are you looking at that? I mean, historically, I think rising cash flow environment that you tends to spend more as a percentage in the share buybacks and dividend. Going forward, how do you look at it with a recent Baron [ph] article talking about the 4% yield, which for you guys at current share price is about $1 per share, do you think the volatility in your business still way too high therefore, you are trying to search for that kind of yield?","William R. Klesse","Well, I've said that once we get through this spending that we're doing, which we think are very good projects -- so you're asking me how do I look at this? And so we have said that we want to pay one of the highest dividends among our peer group, and that is what we're going to do. And then when I try to match it up between dividend and stock buyback, if we don't add better projects that add shareholder value, then we're going to have our dividend that's high or one of the highest of our peer group. And then we'll use the rest of our cash to maintain our investment-grade ratings. So we may buy back some of our debt or redeem it and at the same time retire some of our shares.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bill, do you have a target ratio between in terms of the cash returned to your shareholders, say, 40, 60 between dividend and share buyback; or 30, 70 or any kind of target?","William R. Klesse","No, I do not. But I will go ahead and add, we as a company do not see benefits of special dividends. So we would tend to act in a more regular manner in the sense of what I just said, paying a dividend that's one of the highest of our peer group. And at the same time then, buying our shares.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's great. Bill, in the past, you have said you've been in discussion with Murphy on Milford Haven. Can you update us whether you are still in discussion on that? And also that you have laid out some of the criteria when you're looking at all that, wondering whether BP Texas City will fit into your criteria in general?","William R. Klesse","Okay. So there's always confidentiality agreements associated when we look at things. But I have said our Pembroke refinery is right across the Haven. From Milford Haven. And I have also said there would be some advantages. However, we are not talking to Murphy.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You are not talking to Murphy now?","William R. Klesse","That's correct. And then as far as Texas City, we have said in the past we've looked at that. But there's a confidentiality agreement, and nothing seems to be happening.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of questions for you. One, as I understand it, the results in the quarter were negatively impacted from your long-haul crude purchases that were kind of tied to the WTI-Brent spread, which compressed. I'm just curious if there's any way to, one, quantify that? And then secondly, is there any discussions of maybe changing the way that you struck through the purchasing going forward?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Okay. Yes, Blake, we have estimated what that impact we believe was in the fourth quarter, and the number is about $200 million. And as far as like how we -- I mean, we have an estimate of the number of barrels that we had WTI exposure on. We have been transitioning away from purchasing some of our crudes and hedging away from WTI and reducing that exposure. Joe, do you want to...","Joseph W. Gorder","No. I mean, you're exactly right. During the quarter -- I mean, we looked at the market, we saw the spread had blown out to where it was, and we didn't think it was sustainable. And it was affected by Libyan oil being out of the market and then coming back in. And then the announcement of the Seaway reversal of course had a significant effect on it also. And so we anticipated that it would come back in, and so we started shifting as Mike said, to different basins for our hedging and acquisitions.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. But it's fair to think that, that is not really going to be prevalent in the first quarter?","Joseph W. Gorder","Right.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, Joe, I know you already pretty much covered the export dynamics, but if you don't mind, as I understand it, Valero is increasing their export capacity this year, and I was just curious if you could give us some timing of when that occurs? And is there really incremental demand as it stands right now to actually increase the amount of exports from your system?","Joseph W. Gorder","Yes. And that's a good question, Blake. I mean, we're working on multiple things that are going to facilitate our ability to export more effectively in the future, some logistics projects. But the 2 hydrocracker projects will be a big plus for that. I mean, we will be able to produce diesel fuels that are of a high quality and allow us to move them anywhere. And the European spec is a more stringent spec than just a generic grade, and so we'll be able to move more barrels that direction. And then it all goes to demand. So I'm telling you, we're going to have the ability to export, then it goes to demand. And with what we're seeing in our industry now with refinery closures and shutdowns and reduced run rates, I think we're going to see strong demand. Plus, you have growth in these markets, as Bill said earlier. You got growth in South America, Latin America. You have growth in Mexico. And so in addition to the supply being constrained, you're going to have higher demand. And we're going to be the beneficiaries of that. We always forget how efficient the Gulf Coast refining system is globally, but it is very efficient. And I think we can compete with anybody.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Global Hunter Securities.","Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","It's somewhat related to the WTI-linked long-haul barrels. It's regarding the buy\/sell contract mechanics in the Gulf Coast, which presumably also had an impact in 4Q. Are there any initiatives underway or talks with producers here domestically in the Gulf about using a different kind of contract in that mechanism during the delivery lag?","Joseph W. Gorder","Yes. I guess we would rather not tell you. Okay? I mean, it's a fair question, but we would rather not tell you specifically what we're doing relative to our crude acquisitions. I mean, I think we had a pretty good feel for the market. We made some good decisions, and I'd rather just kind of stop there.","William R. Klesse","But I will add, so you have some feel for it, that what you typically are doing is locking in the differentials. You can do that with WTI. You can do that with Brent. You can do it with a lot of things. And so how we manage that really becomes a company's internal decision. And that's why Joe is saying to us, it's doing our business every day, and it is a competitive world. But it's really locking in the diffs. And obviously, we had some dips locked in on Brent, right? Or we would've lost more money.","Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Well, here's one that should be less controversial. On the retail numbers, the same-store sales were flat year-over-year. It stands in pretty stark contrast to the DOE demand figures. It looks like there's some kind of error in that data set just based on the massiveness of the drop-off. Your retail numbers, is that reflective of a broader picture of better-than-expected demand? Or is that just your location and exposure and company-specific items?","Jean Bernier","This is Jean Bernier here. No, you are right. Our fourth quarter volume, when compared to the same quarter last year, was better in the fourth quarter than our year-to-date trend. Overall, we're up about 1.5% in the fourth quarter versus a drop of 0.5% year-to-date. And on a same-store basis, we had a similar trend. So we did better in the fourth quarter compared to last year, and some regions did better. And Texas, in particular, was a good market for us.","Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Yes, I mean, it's just noteworthy because the weekly DOE numbers have been -- were putting actually a strain on the exchange-traded commodity prices for most of the fourth quarter, and this rebound might reflect some changes in the understanding of that demand picture. So I was just curious if it was a national thing.","Michael S. Ciskowski","Yes. Sam, you just have to remember where our stores are located. They tend to be Southwest, with most of them in Texas. And Texas has a good economy.","William R. Klesse","And then in Canada.","Michael S. Ciskowski","Yes, same thing in our Canadian.","Jean Bernier","Yes. The Canadian volumes are a bit softer when you look at the overall volumes. But that is mainly from our heating and carte blanche segments. If you look at our retail gasoline, we were about flat to last year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","There's quite a significant union issue. Today, I believe, is the deadline. Bill, can you talk a little bit about any potential impacts that we may have? What you expect to happen, what's happened in the past? And also, if you could widen that out from not only a Valero impact potentially but also to a wider industry impact, I'd be grateful.","William R. Klesse","Well, Paul, I'll first speak to Valero. We had 2 refineries that have agreements that terminate tonight. And we continue to negotiate, and I have the expectation that we will have an agreement. At Port Arthur, we have actually 5 agreements, and we tentatively have reached agreement on 4. And so really, there's just one agreement. Now we have -- we're served with notice that they -- I guess it's a notice that says they can strike or will strike if we don't have an agreement here at Port Arthur. And at Port Arthur, we intend to operate, if that's the case. Now as to other companies in the industry, I don't -- some companies were served. We've heard there were 2 companies that were notified that they could have a strike. Remember, we're part of a pattern. Valero is a member of this group that negotiates. Shell has the lead and is negotiating the pattern. So we'll see what happens today, but we expect that we're going to have an agreement. So we'll see what happens.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I think Memphis is the other affected refinery for you guys?","William R. Klesse","Memphis for us is an agreement that expires tonight. At Memphis, we have negotiated with the union an orderly shutdown. And so if they decided to strike, we will shut down at Memphis.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But on balance, you expect an agreement?","William R. Klesse","Yes, we expect an agreement. We're a great company to work for.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I knew that, Bill. I knew that. But it's worth repeating.","William R. Klesse","Maybe there's a job for you here.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I might need one if Wall Street keeps going the way it's going. So the other question I have is on ethanol. I mean, there's been a significant change between Q4 and Q1 in Washington. I wondered if you could just -- I know that you had a record quarter. I believe things are pretty poor right now. And if you could just talk to the way ethanol has shifted and whether we're now in a secular change actually because of what happened in Washington on the credits and stuff?","S. Eugene Edwards","Yes, Paul, this is Gene. Our margins in the fourth quarter averaged about $0.56 a gallon on an EBITDA basis, which is the strongest quarter we ever had obviously. And the year, averaged about $0.35 a gallon. Since then, the margins have come off. Right now, in January, we're somewhere between breakeven to $0.05 a gallon. Pretty weak. Remember last year at this time, we were pretty weak as well. I think I'll let you know what's happening. We lost the blenders' credit, but I don't think that itself has had much to do with the margins because ethanol today is up $0.60 a gallon under gasoline in the East Coast. So it's still a big margin for blenders to blend regardless of whether the credit is there or not. I think what's going on is just supply\/demand. Demand in kind of the fall was around 850,000 barrels a day, plus we were exporting 100,000, 120,000 barrels a day. So you add those together, you needed the supply. And supply ramped up from 900,000 barrels a day to about 950,000 barrels. So it's a very tight market. And what happened in December, January, just a seasonal reduction in gasoline demand, has reduced ethanol blending down to around 750,000, 760,000 barrels a day. And everybody's still running those 940,000 barrels a day. So we've been building inventories. The exports haven't been enough to consume all that with the seasonal drop-off in demand. So going forward, I think what's going to happen, these poor margins we're seeing -- remember these that are even in our plants located in the corn belt. Plants that are outside of the corn belt are negative cash flow right now. So we'll see productions fall off. At the same time, remember the mandate this year is 860,000 barrels a day. So we're blending below the mandate. People are probably using credits right now to blend -- to solve the difference. But at some point, in the near term, we're going to ask the ethanol blending move higher to average 860,000 barrels a day for the year. We factor in exports, which have been strong into Brazil, Canada and Europe, I think they're going to stay in this 100,000, 120,000 barrel a day range. I think the markets are going to get -- just going to tighten back up, and we're just going through a soft period right now.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I see the time's okay now. So I'm going to throw in a third, and it might be a little bit of a question I should know the answer to. But I believe the Gulf margins right now are pretty much an all-time record for January. And we've talked about weak gasoline demand. Obviously, we know the export story. But could you just make any observations you've got on just what's driving that strength? It does seem very impressive.","S. Eugene Edwards","Well, one thing -- it's Gene again. One thing we're seeing on gasoline, the exports have gone up over 600,000 barrels a day. Joe mentioned the number earlier, 500,000. That was for the year. Just on a weekly basis, the numbers continue to look quite good. We talked about Hovensa shutting down and the Petrol Plus issues and some of the East Coast refinery shut down. I think all of those things just kind of tightened up the projections for a stronger spring.","William R. Klesse","And let me add, we don't see the issue per se on supply in the sense that supply is in reasonably good balance for this time of year. It's been a demand conversation. And we're like a lot of people, we see the economy starting to recover. So we think that demand will be better as we get into the summer. And as Gene said, when you think about how the supply side has been affected here, that actually we see good margins as we go into summer.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then just to finalize on that, is there anything strange or unusual about the capture that you're achieving with current margins? Is there anything we should be aware of as we work through Q1?","Joseph W. Gorder","I would say no.","William R. Klesse","Our answer is no. There should be nothing that we're [ph] aware.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A follow-up on the Atlantic basin. I mean, I see the clear benefits on supply for Pembroke from Atlantic basin tightness and closures. Yet, where do you see the volume limitations on Colonial product into the East Coast? And do you see a potential to move more product out of the Gulf Coast into the East Coast? Clearly, you'd think Aruba [ph] would be a lot tighter this summer into that market, x Hovensa events and the 2 other assets that shuttered in November?","Joseph W. Gorder","At Colonial, we'll see it prorated, right? I mean, it's going to stay full all the time. A lot of barrels are moving out of the Gulf to Florida. They can also move around to the East Coast. It always becomes, from our perspective, an arbitrage opportunity. Where can you supply the East Coast demand that we have most efficiently? Is it out of the Gulf, or is it out of Qu\u00e9bec or is it out of Pembroke? And so that's the way we would view this. But as far as the Atlantic basin goes -- I mean, there's just volume coming off from a refining perspective, as we've talked about now everywhere. And it's just making it a much more attractive market for the refiner that can move effectively. We look at our supply opportunities, they're significant. And the issue in trying to determine the ultimate -- that bet that you're looking at, comes down to shipping oftentimes. And foreign flag vessels moving from Quebec and from Pembroke into the New York harbor are advantaged.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. And what's the kind of barge arbitrage out of the Gulf Coast? Is that the widest of those 3, obviously Pembroke and Montr\u00e9al being easier?","Joseph W. Gorder","I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I mean, does the arbitrage have to be the widest in order to justify barging product from the Gulf Coast around Florida into the East Coast? Or is that...","Joseph W. Gorder","No, not always. Not always. It comes down to just being sure that you're efficient in the supply. And there are factors within the refinery that will affect your decision to move one way or the other, okay, in addition to the barge. But generally, we are trying to optimize the margin.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And I have a follow-up question really to differentials. And I guess, first with Maya. I mean, I guess we're constructive on that spread. I mean, what is your ability or what's the spread that -- and since Valero deflects away from Maya and into LLS's, LLS is trading under Brent, and you have a lot of issues, there's a lot of different differentials there. Curious what that price was, or if you were incented in the 4Q to shift away from Maya runs? And then conversely, to the West Coast where crudes are relatively bid into Asian refining start-up capacity, kind of the converse of the Atlantic basin, are you seeing most crude options pricing in the same direction of ANS, which is a tricky marker to follow?","S. Eugene Edwards","Well, this is Gene. Let me turn the Gulf Coast first. I think what we're seeing with Maya prices and where they are today, we're more advantaged on medium sour crudes as opposed to Maya. So we're shifting some there. Also, the LLS is cheaper, much cheaper than foreign sweet. So some of our refineries like Houston can run those sweet -- would lighten up our barrel, our crude side a little bit there. I think the Maya will widen back out. There is competition, more Venezuelan crude coming on. There's still lots of barrels coming out of Columbia. So I think you'll reach more of an equilibrium, so we don't want to just completely go off of Maya and the crudes. But short-term, we just have the ability to flex a little bit. As far as the West Coast, Joe, do you...","Joseph W. Gorder","Well, I mean, I don't think that ANS is behaving any differently than the other crudes out there.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So it's reasonably indicative of kind of what should be realized?","Joseph W. Gorder","Yes. I mean, really, you go to -- the only crude that's out of step with the rest of the market is WTI. I mean, LLS, frankly, no. We're starting to see it move away from Brent, and you'll see that number. I mean, I guess LLS is $1.62 below Dated Brent today, which is a change from where it was last year. But it's weakening. And it's weakening because you're seeing more sweet barrels pushed into the Gulf Coast. And it goes to the thesis that I think Bill and Gene have shared with you guys in the past, that ultimately, domestic sweet crude pushing to the Gulf Coast is going to put pressure on LLS margin. It'll put pressure on foreign sweet pricing. And ultimately, you could see foreign sweet crudes completely backed out of the market. It'll be a benefit to the Gulf Coast refiners. I mean, we've run sweet crude at Meraux. We run sweet crude in Houston, as Gene said. And if you back the foreign sweets out of the Gulf, you're going to benefit Pembroke and Qu\u00e9bec also as those prices come down.","William R. Klesse","So that's probably for a 4-year or 5-year conversation. But we would say, in the U.S. Gulf Coast, on what we see on the production and the capability to move the oil to the Gulf Coast, that the industry may push out all the sweet crude imports into the Gulf Coast, not the East Coast.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But would you think that would change your diet of Maya, I guess is what I'm saying, especially if Maya was supported on resid tightness?","William R. Klesse","Well, I think Gene told you today, we're better off running a medium sours out of our plants than the heavy sours. So what that tells you is you're not going to build new coking today. And in some coker, there's not probably a lot of fun.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If I could slip in one last one if I could. I know you mentioned supporting other various pipelines. I mean, are you seeking nominations on Seaway, I mean, to commit to a potentially advantaged crude source?","William R. Klesse","I think on that one, we probably -- we will decline to answer, except go back to what Joe said earlier. We want the heavy crude to the Gulf Coast. And so we're very public on Keystone, but he also said that we're, in a way, talking to all of these companies.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Gilman from Benchmark Company.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick ones, if I could. Aruba, cash positive in the fourth quarter?","William R. Klesse","Absolutely no.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","That was at a negative? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.","William R. Klesse","Yes -- no, we're not cash positive. We're not.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Could you update us a little bit on the Eagle Ford crude takes at Corpus and Three Rivers in the fourth quarter and where you expect to be in the first?","Joseph W. Gorder","Yes, Mark. This is Joe. We ran about 60 in the quarter. We're running 80 today. And we expect by the end of the second quarter, we'll be running 100.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Joe, how does that split up between the 2 plants?","Joseph W. Gorder","I mean, the bulk of it and certainly in the fourth quarter, I would tell you, 55 of the 60 went to Three Rivers. I think we're going to -- and I don't have it specifically, Mark, but I think we're going to be running 30 of the 80 in Corpus today. And then about that same range in the first quarter.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. The 100 that you mentioned at end of first quarter or second?","Joseph W. Gorder","It'll be during the second quarter.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Any specific plans in place for diesel yield enhancement at Pembroke?","Lane Riggs","Mark, this is Lane. We're currently looking at different ways to reoptimize their FCC catalyst and trying to get to a more distillate selective for riser conditions with catalysts. And obviously, we're looking at their distillations, make sure the right molecule is in the right place. We don't have a project per se right now lined up to increase their diesel production up.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I'm a little bit confused as to what Mike's $200 million number represented in discussing the long-haul crude. Is that pretax, after-tax? Does that encompass what I believe would've been a very negative crude oil impact in the mid-con? And if you could identify roughly what that might have been in the fourth quarter, I'd appreciate it.","Michael S. Ciskowski","Okay. What that does represent, it's a pretax number. And in the volumes, I don't think I can disclose due to...","William R. Klesse","It's a pretax number, and it is -- the question was that we answered on the long-haul crudes, which basically are the crudes that we had exposed to WTI as we set our differentials and locked those crudes in. That is $200 million. Now the other piece you're asking is yes, this negatively impacted our performance when it went from $25 to $10 at Mckee and Ardmore for sure. And we still made money at those refineries, but now we have a $10 diff instead of a $25 diff. And so with the volumes we run at those plants, the difference between in a way $25 down to $10 is about another $200 million. But we were still profitable at those refineries. Obviously, there's a $10 advantage.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That $200 million, Bill, that you just mentioned, that's also a pretax number I assume?","William R. Klesse","Yes. We're giving you everything, Mark, in operating profit.","Mark Gilman - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just one more real quick one because I got to jump, the decision to participate in both cellulosic ethanol as well as biodiesel, it sounds to me as if you're willing to put a reasonable amount of money on the table here.","William R. Klesse","If I can answer you, Mark, we think that in the United States, we are going to have the continuation of the mandates to use it. So we have this renewable volume obligation. And when you look at it, is a large number for us. And even though we manage these in the sense of profit centers, when you look at the overall company, we want to control some of our destinies. Now even if we have a new Congress or whatever, we still think those mandates are going to continue. So the answer is last year, for rents, we spent, how much?","Joseph W. Gorder","$155.","William R. Klesse","$155 million for rent. Does that include the diesel rents?","Joseph W. Gorder","Yes.","William R. Klesse","So that our total. We spent $155 million buying rents. Our estimate for this year is nearly 2x that for rents when you count diesel and cellulosic and regular. So yes, your answer is right. We think it's part of the fuel mix. And we have a good project on biodiesel, or renewable diesel. We have a good partner. So we're going to run that like a refining project. And the Ken Ross project that's been announced with wood we think is a good opportunity to get our toe in.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","So back on the crude hedging loss in the fourth quarter, I'm assuming that you had also a pretty sizable hedging gain then in the first quarter to the third quarter of last year. Mike, could you quantify what those gains might've been?","William R. Klesse","So your question is because we're -- I'm asking you -- because we're buying crude, that we set the differentials against WTI then we benefited just like every other Mid-Continent refiner on that. Is that your question?","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Yes, yes. I'm assuming that you use NYMEX TI contracts to hedge long-haul. So when the spread blew out from $3 to $28 in the first 3 quarters, I'm assuming there was a hedging gain in the first 3 quarters then.","William R. Klesse","All right. So there was. So we're going to answer you for the long haul barrels, okay. Mike?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Okay, yes. That should be -- I mean, that number is estimated to be a little bit over $700 million benefit.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","And Mike, do you have that broken out by quarter?","Michael S. Ciskowski","I do. It's roughly about $250 million in the first quarter; $210 million, second; $250 million, third.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And on all these contracts, is there a particular region that's hitting? Is it all in the Gulf Coast? Or is it spread out between West Coast and Gulf?","Joseph W. Gorder","I mean, our volume is so skewed to the Gulf. That's where you're going to have the biggest effect.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","And then, Mike, in 2012 here, your debt maturities, do you just have the one 6 7\/8% notes coming due?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Right. Well, that's correct. We have $750 million that comes due in April. And then if you look at our balance sheet when you see it, it'll show $250 million of current maturities associated with our AR program. But that renews annually, and we anticipate renewing that.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Right. Okay, then in the fourth quarter, do you have -- what sort of working capital impact did you have on free cash flow?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Actually, we had about -- it's about a $700 million requirement, cash requirement associated with working capital. So what makes that up is our receivables, payables net increase. That was about a little over $300 million. We had an increase in our income tax receivable of about $200 million. And then we also had some prepayments on crude. It's more of a timing deal from January to December. And that was another roughly $200 million.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Okay. Do these items reverse out here in the first quarter?","Michael S. Ciskowski","I'm not exactly sure the timing on the income tax receivable. I mean, on the payables, the receivables payables net, I'm not -- that should reverse over time, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Garcia from Raymond James.","Cory J. Garcia - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","One quick question out of me, sort of switching up the export angle a bit. Are you guys sending any gasoline or diesel off California coast? And maybe quickly, your views on the West Coast export trend?","Joseph W. Gorder","We are not. And my views on the export trend, you got a view on West Coast?","William R. Klesse","Well, we think that there eventually could be an opportunity there. We need to have that capability. That's one reason we're working our cost structure so that we can compete. And that would be into the West Coast of South America. Might have a freight advantage of not going through the Panama Canal. And also, there's action going on, on refining capacity in Hawaii, as you know. But we haven't done anything as of yet, but we're looking at this type of optionality because we believe a key part for all refiners in the United States is having the ability to export.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Mateer from Barclays Capital.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick one. Given the rate of spending this year, you do have a $750 million maturity coming up in April. Can you just tell us what your plans are with respect to that?","William R. Klesse","Well, as of right now, we will go ahead and redeem that. But we're actually looking at how our cash flow goes for the next month or 2 from operations. And our projects look like they're on budget and on time. And so we'll make a decision here in February, latter part of February, on how we're going to address that, whether we're just going to redeem it, or whether we'll need to issue something. That's a foreign item for us, so we'll go back to our board and explain to our board how we're going to do it.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Ashley M. Smith","Okay. Thank you, John, and thank you for listening to our call. If you have any further questions, please contact the Investor Relations department.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

As John will cover in more detail shortly, we reported record first quarter earnings per share. With great performance in a favorable margin environment we demonstrated Valero's earnings power in a heavy maintenance period. The one thing that I'd like to reaffirm with you before we proceed is that our team remains focused on executing our strategies to improve our valuation through operations excellence, optimizing our business through disciplined capital allocation and unlocking asset value.","With that John I'll hand it back over to you.","John Locke","Okay, great thank you Joe. What we like to do now is highlight a few accomplishments this quarter, that aligned with our key strategies and then we\u2019ll cover the quarterly results. As noted in the release our focus on operations excellence yielded solid results while we successfully managed the heavy turnaround season in the first quarter. For the remainder of 2015 we have a lighter schedule of planned maintenance compared to the first quarter. We remain committed to deliver a payout ratio of earnings to our stockholders that exceeds 2014's ratio at 50%. So far we are on track to meet this goal with a 55% payout ratio on first quarter of 2015 earnings.","Regarding capital investments, we continue to optimize and improve our business while maintaining rigor in our capital budget. For 2015 we maintained our guidance for capital spending, including turnarounds and catalysts at approximately $2.65 billion which excludes a $150 million for a St. Charles Methanol project. The proposed St. Charles Methanol project and Houston alkylation units remain under valuation and are progressing through our gaited project management process. We expect to make final investment decisions on these projects later in the second quarter.","With respect to unlocking asset value and accelerating the growth of Valero Energy Partners LP, which is our sponsored Master Limited Partnership, we are clearly delivering growth and have a backlog of assets to dropdown. Given the closing of the $671 million dropdown of our Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services business in March we\u2019re on track to complete our goal of $1 billion of dropdown transactions in 2015.","Now moving on to the quarterly results we reported net income from continuing operations of $964 million or $1.87 per share for the first quarter of 2015. Earnings per share was 21% higher than first quarter 2014 earnings per share of $1.54. The refining segment reported first quarter 2015 operating income of $1.6 billion versus $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2014. We covered the key drivers of this increase in the release but I'd like to highlight that while discounts were more narrow this quarter for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil on a dollar per barrel basis.","On a percentage discount basis these crude were priced more favorably in 2015. For example, in the first quarter of 2015 my [ph] priced on average at a 20% discount to Brent versus a 17% discount in the first quarter of 2014. Our significant crude side flexibility allows us to adjust feedstocks and optimize margins based on the discount environment.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.7 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2015, which is an increase of 9,000 barrels per day versus the first quarter of 2014. Volumes and utilization rates in both periods were impacted by heavy plant maintenance. Refining cash operating expenses were $3.95 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 or $0.04 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2014. That\u2019s our 12th consecutive quarter with cash operating expenses below $4 per barrel. Our focus on safe and reliable operations, combined with advanced domestic energy costs provide us a global manufacturing competitive advantage.","The ethanol segment generated $12 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2015 versus $243 million in the first quarter of 2014. While Ethanol margins compressed in the first quarter of 2015 they have rebounded some here in April. Longer term we believe Ethanol remains a key component of the transportation fuel mix.","General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $147 million in the first quarter of 2015, which is $13 million lower than the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to changes in legal reserves. Also in the first quarter of 2015, net interest expense was $101 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $441 million. The effective tax rate was 31.7%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end total debt was $7.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.9 billion of which $28 million was held by VLP.","Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net [ph] of $2 billion in cash was 20.3%.Valero had over $10 billion of available liquidity including cash. Cash flows in the first quarter included $698 million in capital spending, of which $240 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. We also issued $1.45 billion of debt which included $1.25 billion of bonds in March for general corporate purposes, including the refinancing of current maturities and $200 million issued by VLP to partially fund their March acquisition.","We returned $531 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $206 million in dividend payments and $325 million for purchase of 5.4 million shares of Valero common stock. Year-to-date we have purchased 7.1 million shares for $429 million.","Now for modeling our second quarter operations we expect throughput volumes to fall in the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.55 million to 1.6 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 280,000 to 300,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 460,000 to 480,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be around $3.90 per barrel.","Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.7 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.","We expect G&A expense, excluding corporate depreciation for the second quarter to be around $175 million and net interest expense should be about $105 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $445 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 33%.","Christine, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment we will open the call to questions. During this segment we ask that our callers limit each turn to only two questions. Callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions as time permits.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio","Good morning guys. My first question relates to cash distributions and unlocking value, cash returns averaging 7% yield year-to-date, you also built a billion in cash in the quarter, you\u2019re now through the low end of your leverage guidance of 20% to 30%. I know you mentioned target payout ratio, how do you determine the optimal cash positions that continues to build and determine when to increase distributions from current rates?","Michael Ciskowski","Evan this is Mike. I do not have a precise number I can give you but what I can give you is that in our debt to cap ratio guidance, we reduced our debt by $2 billion [ph]. From there we would like to keep some cushion in our cash balance given the volatility of our business. And then we look at the future capital and working capital requirement and then the payout of greater than 50% that we\u2019ve already committed to you guys. But I would like to point out that excluding the debt issue that we had in the first quarter we actually had a decrease in cash about $300 million.","Evan Calio","Right, as you say, there\u2019s upside scope I guess from a $5 billion cash position to distribution, I guess would be my question.","Michael Ciskowski","Yeah, I mean I would just to add further, we had committed to the greater than 50% payout. As we move through the year and if burning some cash flow continue positive where they are we will assess this and consider increasing that payout number. Go ahead.","Evan Calio","Yeah understood, that makes sense. And then my second question in more on the product demand side and global credit spreads have been higher than expected year-to-date, global demand estimates continue to rise in response to low commodity prices. So is there any comments kind of what you\u2019re seeing through the system on demand trends and what you might expect for summer driving season we may not have seen in quite some time? Thanks.","Gary Simmons","Yeah, Evan this is Gary, I think definitely we\u2019ve been in a good credit spread environment. I would say early in the year it was probably driven from, we had some heavy turnaround maintenance, we find return on maintenance and that type of activity. Also I think the U.S.W Union negotiation came into the play then supported the credit spread. That\u2019s kind of behind it now and I think really the market is being driven up by demand. We\u2019ve seen some pretty encouraging numbers thus far. We expect that, that trend will continue but I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell what\u2019s the magnitude of the demand response will be to the credit price.","Evan Calio","Fair enough guys, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Neil Mehta","Good morning.","Joe Gorder","Good morning.","Neil Mehta","So my first question is just thoughts on spreads and particular Brent oil last which Brent WTI is healthy right now, LOS Brent looks little bit tighter, just any thoughts there in potential bottlenecks between Houston and St. James?","Gary Simmons","Yeah, this is Gary again. I think the LOS to Brent spread has been a little bit narrow than what we would expect. I think ultimately the Gulf Coast Sweet market has the price at the level that allows the East Coast refiners to be able to receive domestic light sweet crude by [indiscernible]. So that kind is healthy overtime that LOS should be around $2 discount to Brent as long as the standard transportation differentials are going to hold. I think on what you\u2019re seeing today is the Houston market is bottlenecked with logistics getting the paid gains [ph] and so we\u2019re seeing Houston trade at much wider discounts to St. James than where it had been and so that\u2019s going ahead, [indiscernible] that economics to hold but they\u2019re right kind of breakeven and I would expect LOS to come off.","Neil Mehta","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful and then on RINS, just any thoughts as we get into the second quarter here on where RINS prices are and how we should assess the impact on a go forward basis?","Martin Parrish","This is Martin Parrish. So we think the RINS are just where they are, just waiting on the EPA announcement in June and just the uncertainty even though the EPA set it at the levels as everybody just waiting to see. So I think after June we'll see what happens then.","Neil Mehta","All right, very good. Thank you very much guys and talk soon.","Joe Gorder","Thanks Neil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward Westlake","Yes, good morning and I guess the first question still on the macro side. We are seeing a decent tanker [indiscernible] still from the Gulf of - Saudi are still pumping. I mean you drilled Mexico and Venezuela how would you characterize at the moment supply availability of water borne mediums inside into the system.","Gary Simmons","I feel very good. Like you said we actually in the first quarter ran more South American crudes than what we've historically run. The Saudi are committed to the U.S. market. So I don't know that we'll go back to levels of imports that we saw three years ago. But I definitely think that volumes into the US Gulf will be up from what we saw last year. We're seen a lot more heavy Canadian than historical. So overall the Gulf Coast seems well supplied with all grades crudes.","Edward Westlake","Right, okay. And on the VLP, I mean obviously a great - in March, a $1 billion, clearly very easy to achieve. Any view of going faster or you just hoping that $1 billion which is obviously a still healthy pace is the right pace going forward.","Joe Gorder","No, and this is Joe. And we're very comfortable with the $1 billion pace this year and so that would imply that we're going execute another drop sometime in the second half of the year, probably later in the second half of the year. But what our real focus is, is on the distribution increase and we're committed to growing into that 25% plus this year for the next couple of years. So we're very comfortable with the pace we've got right now.","Edward Westlake","Okay, thanks very much Joe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Hey guys good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hi Paul.","Paul Cheng","Joe, couple of years I think the company when looking at California has always said is not really a core for the long haul, and you're looking for, if someone give you a okay price that you would sell, is there any change in the view from management about how you look at California from a long-term standpoint. And if it is now part of your long-term portfolio? Is there any initiative for you that you're picking to improve the result relative to your key value seems to be lacking in there?","Joe Gorder","Yeah, well Paul we've said this before that on the west coast we have very good assets and we have very good management teams operating those assets. And frankly we view our portfolio on the west coast as an option when the margins are strong on the west coast. And certainly we're experiencing that today and we had a very good first quarter. If you don't mind Paul what I'll do is let Lane just speak to our capital approach to the west coast.","Lane Riggs","Hey Paul it's Lane. We just continue to be very disciplined in our capital. We look for small opportunistic enterprise to improve margin capture but we in, terms of like any major capital program we - in the event that we spend much money we have better opportunities in our Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent. So I would say though one of the things you'll see in terms of our margin capture because we need to make so much gasoline you'll see our capture versus an index probably got better. The first quarter is really a story of on the west coast to the west coast gasoline fracs.","Paul Cheng","The second question, Mike going back into the cash position, is there a lag or you can share what is the comfort level of the cash that you want to hold?","Michael Ciskowski","Well, I don't really have guidance for you on like a minimum cash balance but you can start with the $2 billion that we use in our debt calculation. And then we would like to keep some cushion in that given the volatility of our business.","Paul Cheng","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chi Chow of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.","Chi Chow","Hey, thanks, good morning.","Joe Gorder","Good morning Chi.","Chi Chow","I have a couple of questions on the North Atlantic market. You've realized strong double digit margins in that region for two quarters running now. Tad one [ph] and European cracks been pretty robust over this period. What do you think is the sustainability of those tighter product markets in that Atlantic Basin region?","Gary Simmons","Well, I think there is a number of reasons for what we have seen in the first quarter and I think some of it is sustainable, you know obviously we had strong turnaround maintenance in that area as well, colder weather helped - always helped with demand but I think you are seeing good demand response in a lower crack price which is certainly constructive moving forward. I think the other thing that is happening the U.S. dollar strength versus the Europe it helped us with our operating costs, it is and - Pembroke as well. So I think there is a lot of encouraging signs on it.","Joe Gorder","This is Joe, the one thing I would add to Gary\u2019s point, which are all correct is that the Pembroke asset is a very good asset and what we acquired when we bought that refinery was an integrated system. So when you think about merchant refining in Europe you really shouldn\u2019t think about Pembroke in that regard. The distillate barrels that we produce are moved in inland and certainly a significant volume of the gasoline moves inland. So it is a little bit difference set-up than some might be experiencing.","Chi Chow","Are you concerned about distillate crack spud weakness going forward with all the global capacity that\u2019s come online over the year, last year or so.","Joe Gorder","I would say we are not that concerned about the distillate cracks in our system. I think there is a couple of things, the U.S. market has been so strong we still see good export demand. However, we have been somewhat priced out of the market because our market has been so strong. So I think we think moving forward we will see a combination of a better demand domestically and we will see that our export volumes will pick-up again as the U.S. market falls off a little bit.","Chi Chow","What were your export volumes for the quarter on gas and diesel?","Joe Gorder","It is our gasoline was down a little bit at 94,000 barrels a day. The reason for that was really just because of the strength in the U.S. market. You know again this is an optimization for us and we would kind of say the way we optimize that it is more demand push rather than supply push and the export markets really weren\u2019t strong in on gasoline to pull the barrels away from goal. Our distillate volume were fairly flat about 205,000 barrels a day ULSD. If you look at the ULSD plus kerosene we were up, 255,000 [ph] barrels a day, so fairly consistent there. The change we saw for a lot of the first quarter in Europe was in open, so we are usually 64 between Latin America and Europe 70% of our volume actually went to Latin America and we did see that for the Europe that we predict foreseeing.","Chi Chow","And one more question on the North Atlantic, can you talk how the 9 million [ph] reversal is going to impact your crude sourcing options going forward?","Michael Ciskowski","Yes, I will give you little update on that you know we are still waiting for regulatory approval on land from the National Energy Board in Canada. We don\u2019t know the timeline on that. We feel like there is a good chance the NEB could approve that by mid-May. With a mid-May approval that would mean we really won\u2019t see any impact from line 9 in the second quarter.","But we are optimistic we will start to receive oil in the third quarter, gives us a lot more flexibility in Quebec to be able to have the access to those Western Canadian and Bakken grades and not just relay on rail and U.S. Gulf Coast sourced barrels.","Chi Chow","Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Okay, thanks. Good morning gentlemen. Maybe if I could follow-up first with a follow-up question on VLP, is there earlier we talked about the potential for any evaluation of the wholesale fuel distribution EBITDA as a potential to drop the VLP. Maybe can you talk a little bit about whether that has done evaluation and any rough guidance to what that figure might look like?","Michael Ciskowski","Yeah, Ryan this is Mike again. You know we are still evaluating that in the appropriate structure that we would consider to drop in the MLP. So I do not have a number that I can give to you on this call.","Ryan Todd","Okay, great. I appreciate and then maybe just a general I mean we see the margin on the screen which looks supportive. But can you give us maybe just an update on what you are seeing a month in the second quarter in terms of the general operating environment?","Michael Ciskowski","Yes, I think we are - the cracks continue to be strong and we continue to see good discounts on the crude. The big change probably has been in the crude market, some of the discounts could commence and we're run the lot more light sweet crude in our system today than what we did in the first quarter. But again I think we're seeing good demands both in the export markets and domestic demands. And so feel very encouraged about the profitability moving forward.","Ryan Todd","Okay great, thanks. I appreciate it.","Joe Gorder","Thanks Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Dietert of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.","Jeff Dietert","Good morning.","Joe Gorder","Good morning Jeff.","Jeff Dietert","I had a strategic question. I think historically Valero\u2019s been a little bit more of a refining pure play relative to some of the peer strategies that have been more integrated. You guys have sold off NuStar interest in Corner Store. And I was just hoping for an update on now Valero strategy is evolving going forward. What do you think about integration through the value chain do you expect a materially larger mid-stream business.","Joe Gorder","Jeff that's a good question. I mean very clearly we are fuels manufacturing company. And certainly that involves refining it also involves our renewable fuels business. So that is it is such a significant part of the portfolio today to see any significant shift from that it just really - is not in the cards now.","To answer your question on the mid-stream business. I do think we're going to see our midstream business expands significantly over the next several years. And as we've said our strategy in mid-stream is really to develop projects and acquire assets that are supportive of Valero's core businesses and I think if you look at the investments that we've made to date it would certainly support that. That being said the refining portfolio is large enough and the renewables portfolio is large enough that it provides plenty of opportunity for growth within that midstream business.","I don't think you should expect us though to be looking upstream from where we are today in any material way or significantly downstream from where we are today. Although opportunities present themselves and you look at it but certainly that's not part of our plan today.","Jeff Dietert","Thank you and secondly, looking through your refinery throughput guidance for the second quarter, it looked relatively conservative and my question is what are the LPs suggesting that you should max run, under what conditions would you run more aggressively or perhaps less aggressively.","Michael Ciskowski","I think in terms of throughput probably be the biggest thing. And change as we see a pretty good rate level on some of our plants depending on if we're maximizing heavy sour versus light sweet especially like at $4 Jeff. It can change our throughput significantly when we start maximizing light sweet over heavy sour. I would say that was the only thing I can speak.","Jeff Dietert","Thanks for your comments.","Joe Gorder","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brad Heffern","Good morning everyone.","Joe Gorder","Good morning.","Brad Heffern","So just following up on the couple of previous answers looking for a little more color. I think in the first quarter you all talked about just the sheer number of water borne that were trying to find their way into the Valero system. Is the fact that you're running less water borne now and more domestic suggest that maybe the global crude environment is and is oversupplied as it was a few months ago.","Michael Ciskowski","I think there has been a couple of events that are kind a driving the crude differentials. First, the medium seller market in the Gulf due to the market structure a lot of people were pulling their barrels off the market trying to hold them in collective role. So it kind of tightened up the medium sours. Now the storage is getting full. You also have some turnaround maintenance going on to the Deepwater pipe ones in the Gulf that's kind of also tightening the market a little bit. And then the heavy sour side in the Myer [ph] of course you had the buyer on the platform in Mexico which has also disrupted production there.","So as my view is that these crudes as they compete with the light sweet we'll see the differentials come back as we move in the second quarter.","Brad Heffern","And okay that's great color. And then maybe for Joe, a lot of E&P's have seem pretty confidence of way that the crude export ban is going to be lifted in the near term maybe in 2015. Do you have any updated thoughts or anything you've been hearing about that.","Joe Gorder","Well I think we're probably hearing the same thing that you're hearing and we know that there is activity in the house and decided to bring the issue forward. But certainly the administration does doesn\u2019t seem at all receptive to this. Anyhow just to be clear on our position we believe in free and open market. As we talked about many times there\u2019s currently legislation and regulation in place that hinders the petroleum markets from being free and open and these for the included things like the crude export ban, RFS, the Jones and others. So we believe that looking at a specific issue relative to that overall issue is just not the right way to deal with this topic and you need to deal with all of the issues.","One thing about Valero is that we\u2019ve continued to invest and we\u2019re running significant quantities of domestic crude today and we continue to invest to enable us to run more of this crude. So we\u2019re doing what we can to process it as are many other refiners. And then really the last point on this is when you look at the general need for crude exports the U.S. remains a net importer of crude oil with about 7 million barrels per day coming in we certainly export much lower volumes than that. So the question becomes do you really need the export and I think that\u2019s the question on everybody\u2019s mind.","Brad Heffern","Okay, great that\u2019s it from me, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate","Thanks good morning everyone. Morning Joe.","Joe Gorder","Morning Doug.","Doug Leggate","If I could follow up on the last question on exports Joe from what we\u2019re seeing it looks like light sweet imports from Middle East in particular, looking at Kuwait in particular this is one example, they actually seem kind of increasing I'm just curious as to what is your strategy around accessing light sweet or just generally crudes outside of the U.S. and how do you think that impacts the crude export to-date? I think that\u2019s one of the key issues as the net balance as opposed to just the issue itself?","Joe Gorder","Sure Doug, I\u2019ll let Gary, if you don\u2019t mind we\u2019ll let Gary speak to the imports.","Gary Simmons","Yes, so Doug I would tell that primarily what we see from Kuwait is really not light sweet is more medium sour barrels and I would tell you that we have had many discussions with them and they seem interested on maintaining or actually growing market share in the U.S. on that grades of crude and the light sweet what we see happened is with all this volatility in the Brent TI moving in and out when the order comes in very narrow then we start to see incentives to import light sweet. In the first quarter we definitely saw that and as I\u2019ve discussed in the past the first place we generally see is at Kuwait and there were certainly times during the first quarter where the Brent TI got narrow and that incentivized to step back in and buy Brent related West African type crudes.","Doug Leggate","Okay I appreciate the answer. Obviously we\u2019re watching this one closely, but my follow up Joe is really on the return of cash to shareholders and it\u2019s obviously the share price I guess like all other financial have done well from a lot of this trend in the first quarter and I think you said you guys said yourself in the prepared remarks the business is obviously volatile. When you think about the last time your predecessor had a very substantial share buyback program and where are the share prices now in the flight to Euro again embarking on a very substantial share buyback program how do you think about balancing the timing and I guess the balance between dividends and other methods of returning cash as opposed to just right buying back stock at current levels and I\u2019ll leave there, thanks.","Joe Gorder","All right Doug I\u2019ll speak to it briefly and see if Mike has anything to add but the timing of the market is something that is almost impossible to do, right. I think the particular transaction you\u2019re referring to might have been the accelerated share repurchase that we executed some years ago and we don\u2019t have plans to do that. Now I don\u2019t want to get into being specific about our strategies around share repurchases other than that we\u2019ve committed to this greater than 50% payout ratio which we said would be a blend of repurchases and the dividend. We had a significant increase in the dividend at the end of January and we continue to look at cash and how we\u2019re going to employ it. What the capital budget is very manageable in the current context so I think if you said what are your plans are I think our plan is to continue to buyback share certainly to meet that greater than 50% target. Mike is there anything that you?","Michael Ciskowski","I think that\u2019s well said.","Joe Gorder","Okay.","Doug Leggate","Thanks a lot everyone.","Joe Gorder","All right Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresh","Hi good morning.","Joe Gorder","Good morning Phil.","Phil Gresh","First question just on the midstream M&A potential. Appreciate the color you've given already just a follow up, would you rather have more EBITDA drop at this point before you consider midstream M&A at VLP. Are you comfortable within out of EBITDA there already and to extent that you would consider midstream M&A would you likely or do have developed any other Valero level given the cash that you have available right now.","Michael Ciskowski","Phil, this is Mike. I think at this point in VLP stage they've probably would prefer to do the drops and get a little bit more sizable before they start taking on third party acquisitions. As you know the drops come with the minimum volume commitments they you may not all even get in the third party deal, depending on the deal so given their size I would say the drops are the more likely have that they will go.","Phil Gresh","Got it okay. And just one final question the export ban. I guess the question is really like if you think about the ban being lifted if it were to happen. Would this materially change how you manage your business whether its growth projects or refine your logistics potential M&A aspirations just generally how do you think about the way you're managing your business today versus in that kind of a world and how you think about crude differentials.","Joe Gorder","Well Just I'll fly over this and then let Gary speak to it if he would like to also our strategy is to optimize our operations. And that is a broad statement I know when it goes to our crude and feedstock slate it goes to our disposition of our products and it goes to our capital investments. And so I think what you would see certainly there is nothing that we're doing today that I would say we need to change in a crude export environment. We'll have to see what the market does and how the market will respond to that. I mean I guess you're pushing you'll be pushing additional crude barrels into the markets that seems to be well supplied today. And so the question are might this how the market is going to react to that and honestly if I don't think we're smart enough to tell you what that will be. Gary you\u2026?","Gary Simmons","No, I agree. I think overall even if the export ban is lifted we would continue to have a location advantage running the domestic crudes. We continue to have significant operating costs advantage with the cheap natural gas. And then we're very happy with our portfolio of refining assets that are very complex very efficient refineries.","Joe Gorder","And whether there is have a - material change on your real crude differentials?","Gary Simmons","No, I don't think so I think overall the crude have to continue it compete or stays in refineries and so we're going to be the beneficiary in that.","Phil Gresh","Okay great thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sam Margolin of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Sam Margolin","Good morning. I wanted to ask you about the notes offering, familiar within the context of the gated process that you guys have talked about a lot. How was the pricing sort of relative to your expectations, did it change anything as far as return hurdles and maybe opening up some more capital intensive optimization plans or even or even on the M&A side? I mean it was a pretty in line with what you're expecting.","Joe Gorder","Yes, the interest rates were well and pretty much where we expect for that offering coming at. I mean the funds will be used for general corporate purposes including the refinancing of our current maturities. I do not think that the issuance of that debt will increase any gated capital project or anything like that. It was just an opportunity to issue debt at low rate.","Sam Margolin","Okay thanks a lot. And I don't think I heard you guys mentioned Methanol in the prepared remarks. So I'm assuming this question is again it gave any far. But I'll ask anyway. Is there anything incremental there to update us with there with or is it still just in the evaluative stages and or wait on the final decision.","Lane Riggs","Hey Sam this is Lane so I'll just give a bit of an update. It's kind of where it's been. We anticipated our funding decisions here late in the second quarter. I'll just add any real consider this project going forward and our strategy we'd obviously more likely have a partner and we I would add that in terms of comment, that we're still on track to review this project here in the late second quarter.","Sam Margolin","All right, perfect, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read","Good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hello, Roger.","Roger Read","Just wanted to follow-up, I guess, Jeff Dietert\u2019s question about potential higher throughputs and what signals maybe we need to look forward here either in terms of Brent LOS relationship or are there other sort of last mile pipeline issues in the Gulf Coast to think you hit you know higher throughput number in the second quarter here potentially hitting a higher number I would say.","Joe Gorder","I don\u2019t really know what link come in the only thing I can think we are definitely signaling higher runs of light sweet crude which can have a late leverage at some of our heavy sour refiners but I don\u2019t know of anything else that would signal significantly different throughputs.","Lane Riggs","No, right now our economic signals maximum throughput and Gary mentioned in the earlier answer there are obviously a rate thing that occurred in whether we were running light, medium or heavy sour crudes that obviously doesn\u2019t impact on our overall throughput.","Roger Read","Okay, thanks. And then back to the OpEx initial comments mentioning under $4 for several quarters on a row here and then you know FX strength that helped out Pembroke. So could you kind of walk us through is there anything that you have operationally challenged and succeed or we are looking at you know it is cheap natural gas and it is an FX item flowing through this healthcare lower OpEx and I know throughput\u2019s being high also helps on a per barrel basis but if there is anything else you can offer that will be great.","Lane Riggs","This is Lane. I want to say we are always vigilant on operating cost is our culture we work every day, every month, every hour, to make sure that we are busy maintaining our fixed and our structural operating it is into natural gas prices in the first quarter versus the fourth in last year throughputs were a little bit and so partially offset by that and we will absolutely maintain our focus volume and having lower operating cost.","Roger Read","But nothing specifically you think about it is just general pressure on the system?","Lane Riggs","No, no.","Roger Read","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez","Hi, guys, good morning. Two questions for you if I could; one, you mentioned in the press release the benefit of the secondary product pricing and I assume that is just kind of some spill over from the glut in crude prices but now that we are starting to see kind of reversal in the crude markets and moving higher. Are you starting to see a bit of a reversal on that secondary product pricing here into 2Q?","Joe Gorder","Well I would definitely say that you know when you get out into the products other than gasoline [indiscernible] PATCO, LPG a lower slot price environment tend to have these products trade closer to group value and it helps track realization and as crude moves up and the reserve will also be true.","Blake Fernandez","Okay. Gary, secondly just a follow-on for me previous exports commentary the shift that we have seen basically away from Europe. Can you just talk a little bit about the upper - needed there in other words to drive the economics to incentivize transport over to Europe is it basically like a $1, $2 a barrel that is needed and then maybe as a follow-on to that. Do you have any sense I know you mentioned indigenous demand growth here, but do you have any sense that maybe from European utilization rates moving up there or any of the new global facilities beginning to penetrate that market do you have any color there? I appreciate it, thanks.","Gary Simmons","Yeah, I guess I will start with that. I think we just still feel like our traditional exports markets are there for us as long as it is economic for us to supply those markets and we have seen a move back to where we are Europe it is open you know it basically is just looking at the differences in the two markets, freight and then we are also taking to effect the RINS. And so the higher RINS prices that we are seeing today helps incentivize exports basically to Europe. So you know freight generally were lower $2 you know to get a barrel to Europe and the RINS in the 71 that range that kind of give you the differential that\u2019s needed to support exports.","Blake Fernandez","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys, I have two quick follow-up. One, Joe can you give us or maybe this is for Lane, the [indiscernible] expansion are we done that, or that what is the schedule there?","Lane Riggs","No, we\u2019re finished there, this is Lane by the way Paul, we finished that in the third quarter this year.","Paul Cheng","All right. And maybe that this is for Gary. Gary, are you guys currently, given the current defense. Are you exporting crude oil from the Gulf Coast to Quebec? And that also after the Line 9 reversal complete do you still need to export from the Gulf Coast or that you will get sufficient Western Canadian crude into Quebec?","Gary Simmons","Yes. Paul so we are exporting from the Gulf to Quebec in the first quarter little over a 70% of our diet was crude sourced from Canada and the US gulf and post Line 9 we would still anticipate that we would see some flow of oil from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Canada over the water.","Paul Cheng","Can I ask a final question?","Joe Gorder","Just for you","Paul Cheng","Thank you. In the last two years when we look at from the first to the second quarter, your margin capture rate seems highest on an average drop by about 10%. Into the first quarter this year that do you have a far more heavy down time especially in the Gulf Coast and in the second quarter your - is going to be much higher. So should we still assume that your margin capture rate would be the pattern will be similar to the last two years that drop of roughly above 10% from the first quarter therefore or that it should deviate somewhat differently?","Joe Gorder","Yeah, Paul so generally what would be happening in the transition for the first to second quarter you go through our VP [ph] transition on the gasoline and decrease ethane blending which drive down our crack repayment. You\u2019re correct that as we have lighter turnaround main region in the Gulf it should offset some of that where we come out I don\u2019t know but I\u2019ve to look at it.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Thank you.","Joe Gorder","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to John Locke.","John Locke","Hey, great. Thanks Christine. We appreciate those who called in today and everyone listening. If you have additional questions please contact me or Karen in the IR department.","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to the Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Homer Bhullar","Good morning. And welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you've not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it\u2019s says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the Company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.","Joe Gorder","Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone.","We're pleased to report that we completed another good quarter where we ran our business well and delivered solid financial results. Throughout the quarter, we maintained our unrelenting focus on operations excellence, which enabled us to operate safely and reliably in an environmentally responsible manner. We also delivered on our commitment to invest in growth projects and acquisitions that increased Valero's earnings capability while maintaining solid returns to our stockholders.","In 2018, we matched 2017 record for process safety performance, and we continue to outperform the industry on our personal injury rates. Logistics investments we made over the last several years are contributing significantly to earnings. Our investments in Line 9B, the Diamond Pipeline and the Sunrise Pipeline expansion increased our system\u2019s flexibility, allowing us to take advantage of the opportunities available in the fourth quarter of 2018. In fact, we set a record for total light crude runs at 1.5 million barrels per day and a record for North American light crude processed at over 1.3 million barrels per day. We also continued to maximize products exports into higher netback markets in Latin America.","Turning to capital allocation. We continue to execute according to our disciplined framework. Our projects and execution remain on track. Construction is scheduled to finish on the Houston alkylation unit in the second quarter. And the Central Texas pipelines and terminals are expected to be completed in mid-2019.","In November, the Board of Directors of Valero and Darling Ingredients, approved an expansion of the Diamond Green Diesel plant to 675 million gallons per year of renewable diesel production and the construction of a renewable naphtha finishing facility.","With respect to cash returns to stockholders in 2018, we paid out 54% of our annual adjusted net cash provided by operating activities, exceeding our target annual payout range of 40% to 50%. Our solid financial position and a favorable outlook for our business enabled us to further demonstrate our commitment to our investors, as last week, our Board approved a 12.5% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.90 per share or $3.60 annually.","Lastly, earlier in January, we closed the acquisition of Valero Energy Partners. This transaction was immediately accretive and it's greatly simplified our structure. While Valero will no longer have a publicly traded midstream business, VLP\u2019s assets and ongoing logistics investments at Valero will continue to enhance our feedstock and product flexibility.","Now, as we look ahead, we remain committed to our capital allocation framework. There has been no change in our capital discipline strategy, which prioritizes our investment grade ratings, sustaining investments and paying our dividends. We expect our annual CapEx for both 2019 and 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion, in line with where it's been over the last several years. And you should expect incremental discretionary cash flow to continue to compete with other discretionary uses, including cash returns, growth investments and M&A.","In closing, with a growing economy, a year-over-year increase in vehicle miles traveled, and low fuel prices, we\u2019re encouraged for 2019. We expect good demand in domestic and exports markets this year. Despite seasonal weakness in the gasoline market, days of supply for distillate inventories remained below the five-year average. Expected incremental diesel demand and discounts for sour feedstocks associated with the impending global fuel oil sulfur reduction also give us a reason to remain optimistic.","We believe that our system\u2019s flexibility to process a wide range of feedstocks and reliably supply quality fuels as evidenced by our fourth quarter 2018 results, positions Valero well for whatever opportunity the market presents to us.","So, with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you.","Homer Bhullar","Thank you, Joe.","For the fourth quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $952 million or $2.24 per share compared to $2.4 billion or $5.42 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2018 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $900 million or $2.12 per share, compared to $509 million for $1.16 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017.","For 2018, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $3.1 billion or $7.29 per share, compared to $4.1 billion or $9.16 per share in 2017. 2018 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $3.2 billion or $7.37 per share, compared to $2.2 billion or $4.96 per share in 2017.","The 2018 adjusted results exclude several items reflected in the financial tables that accompany this release, while the 2017 adjusted results exclude an income tax benefit of $1.9 billion from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For reconciliations of actual to adjust amounts, please refer to those financial tables.","Operating income for the refining segment in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $1.5 billion, compared to $971 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 was mainly attributed to wider discounts for North American sweet crude and certain sour crudes relative to Brent, partly offset by weaker gasoline margins.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 3 million barrels per day, which was in line with the fourth quarter of 2017. Throughput capacity utilization was 96% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.92 per barrel were $0.34 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2017, mostly due to higher natural gas costs in the fourth quarter of 2018.","The ethanol segment generated $27 million operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $37 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease from 2017 was primarily due to lower margins, resulting from lower ethanol prices.","Operating income for the VLP segment in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $88 million, compared to $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 was mainly due to contributions from the Port Arthur terminal assets and Parkway Pipeline, which were acquired in November 2017.","For the fourth quarter of 2018, general and administrative expenses were $230 million and net interest expense was $114 million. General and administrative expenses for 2018 of $925 million were higher than 2017, mainly due to adjustments to our environmental liabilities.","For the fourth quarter of 2018, depreciation and amortization expense was $531 million. And income tax expense, which includes certain income tax benefits, as reflected in the accompanying earnings release tables, was $205 million. Excluding these benefits, the effective tax rate was 21%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter-end, total debt was $9.1 billion, and cash and cash equivalents was $3 billion. Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 24%","At the end of December, we had $4.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. We generated $1.7 billion of net cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter. Excluding the unfavorable impact from a working capital decrease of approximately $120 million, net cash generated was $1.8 billion.","With regard to investing activities, we made $771 million of growth and sustaining capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2018, of which $254 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. For 2018, we invested $2.7 billion of which approximately $1.9 billion was for sustaining and $800 million was for growth.","Moving to financing activities. We returned $965 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter, $627 million was for the purchase of 7.7 million shares of Valero common stock and $338 million was paid as dividends. As of December 31st, we had approximately $2.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.","We expect capital investments for 2019 to be approximately $2.5 billion, with approximately 60% allocated to sustaining the business and approximately 40% to growth. Included in the total, our turnarounds, catalyst and joint venture investments.","For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.67 million to 1.72 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 265,000 to 285,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 475,000 to 495,000 barrels per day.","We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.05 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.42 per gallon, which includes $0.06 for gallon for noncash costs, such as depreciation and amortization.","For 2019, we expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $840 million. The annual effective tax rate is estimated at 23%. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $110 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $550 million.","Lastly, we expect RIN\u2019s expense for the year to be between $400 million and $500 million.","That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Blake Fernandez with Simmons Energy. Your line is open.","Blake Fernandez","Good morning, guys. Congrats on the stellar results. I appreciate the outlook for two years on CapEx. I think, there was some perception maybe with the project sanction last year that there would be upward pressure, and we're actually seeing a $200 million decrease year-over-year, and that sustained into 2020. Can you talk a little bit about where maybe some of that defilation has coming from, whether it's the growth component or sustaining or turnarounds?","Lane Riggs","This is Lane. I wouldn't call it deflation, I would call that we had a -- we had a lot of sustaining capital with respect to Tier 3 and plus the reliability project at our Corpus Christi refinery in 2018. Our run rate is like what we've said is normally about $1.5 billion to sustain our assets. We had a little bit more than that in this past year. And there's obviously timing involved and all that. Whether our turnarounds get a little bit lumpy or again we end up having to do something a little bit special on some environmental, currently we don't have anything on our forward view of that.","Blake Fernandez","Okay, great. The second question is on Venezuela, obviously very topical. I guess, one, could you confirm how much you're currently importing crude there? But then, I guess more importantly, I\u2019m just curious, in order to replace those barrels, are you looking to resort to more light sweet domestic crudes or just largely maxed out on light sweet to where you're actually going to have to resort to the global market for kind of medium and heavy sour replacement barrels? Thanks.","Gary Simmons","Yes. Blake, this is Gary. Of course, with the sanctions, we're currently not taking anything from Venezuela. But, it was about 20% of our heavy sour that we run was Venezuelan barrels historically. We're certainly hopeful that we\u2019ll see proper resolution to the crisis, not only for the benefit of the crude markets but for the welfare of the people of Venezuela. We've seen production decline in Venezuela for years, and we've also known there was a threat of sanctions. So, we\u2019ve put alternatives in place to be prepared for this. Of course, the announcement was just made Monday; we've only had 48 hours to respond.","Our top priority really has been to get to next 30-day supply plan covered. And I can tell you we're in a lot better position today than we were on Tuesday, but we still have some holes to fill in our supply plan. We really run Venezuelan barrels at two of our refineries in the Gulf, St. Charles and Port Arthur. The St. Charles refinery did begin a turnaround on their crude and coker unit. So, that definitely minimizes the impacts that the sanctions had on our system.","To your point, current economics are certainly pushing us to maximize light sweet in the system.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with Evercore. Your line is open.","Doug Terreson","I wanted to see if we could get some elaboration on Joe's points that you made a few minutes ago about market fundamental. And typically while distillate demand and inventories appear to be positive in both the U.S. and the Atlantic Basin, the converse seems true for gasoline, although seasonality and net exports should be supportive. And then, also, could you just spend a minute covering how fuel oil markets are likely to sort out this year, given the uncertainty that Blake just highlighted about Canada and Venezuela and heavy feedstocks and how you might adjust?","Gary Simmons","Yes. This is Gary again. Of course, it seems like early in the year, during this call, we always are kind of panic on the gasoline markets. We feel very good about gasoline demand moving forward. high employment and low gasoline prices should result in good gasoline demand. The wild card of course becomes refinery utilization. So, with the 20-year high refinery utilization we saw last year, we are starting the year with a bit of an overhanging. The overhanging gasoline has primarily been PADD 1, PADD 2 and PADD 3.","If I look at those regions individually, I could see that we build a little bit more inventory in PADD 1. The market structure is such that there's an economic incentive to make summer grade gasoline and put it in tankage in New York Harbor, and they're still tankage available. So, that would come. You could some inventory again in PADD 1. I think you'll see some significant improvements in both PADD 2 and PADD 3 moving forward.","PADD 2, I think, a lot of the gasoline build was a result of the crude discount. The margins were just very strong. So, typically at PADD 2, you see refinery utilization drop off in the winter to balance the market. But with the crude discounts where, they ran hard. But if I look at the PADD 2 market now, there looks to be more planned maintenance this year than was last year. As we move forward and then currently with the cold snap hitting PADD 2, there seems to be quite a few refinery issues in that region. In fact, the Explorer Pipeline between group 3 and Chicago is now pro-rated, indicating there's a big pull for products in that region.","So, I think you'll see gasoline inventories draw in PADD 2. And I also think you'll see some good gasoline draws in PADD 3 as well. Then, the Gulf, early in the year, we typically have fog issues which hinder our ability to export product, and we saw that again this year. We also saw a bottleneck trying to get gasoline into Mexico, which is obviously our largest export destination. And then, we saw a lot of refiner buying interest in the Gulf as well as people build some inventory in preparation for turnaround, so they could cover their supply during their outages.","So, I think, all those things, as you see lower utilization in the Gulf as a result of planned maintenance beginning and you see exports pick up, I'm confident you'll see inventories in PADD 3 grow as well. So, I think we feel pretty good about gasoline. We feel very good about gasoline demand. And again, the wildcard is what utilization is going to be going forward.","Doug Terreson","Okay. Any insight on fuel oil too?","Gary Simmons","Yes, fuel oil. I think, it definitely is the issue you talk about. There has been a lot of significant hits to fuel on the supply side with OPEC cuts and the Iranian sanctions, now Venezuelan sanctions and production cuts in Western Canada. If you look at the forward curve on fuel oil, it's backward about $1 a month, and a lot of that is tied to the IMO 2020 fuel spec change. We do see fuel moving weaker as a result of lower demand for high sulfur fuel oil. And then, there's some signs that some of the production can be coming on. The Alberta government did announce that they're going to go ahead and raise production in February, at least 75,000 barrels day. So, some of those things will help as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng","Hi. Good morning, guys. Before I ask my question, since that I told John Locke, if your Gulf Coast realized margin is going to be filed probably in excess of 650, I will publicly lobby Joe you to give Gary and his crude supply team a big bonus. So, I'm lobbying you.","Gary Simmons","Paul, you're really helpful to me here.","Paul Cheng","Anyway. So, other than that, two questions. First, looking at the current level in the fourth quarter, I mean, I think everyone is already trying to maximize on the distillate yield. So, in your system, is there any more that you can actually do that to shift from gasoline to distillate. And also, you said you're running a record 1.5 million barrels per day in the light oil. Is there any more that you can -- can you quantify that, how much more if there's any that you can actually move from medium and heavy into light?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So, I would tell you on the gasoline to distillate swing, there's very little else we can do. We're pretty much maxed out on distillate today. On light crude, we would tell you that the numbers Joe gave you that was about 90% of our light sweet capacity. And so, there is some room there to push some additional light sweet crude into our system.","Paul Cheng","So, Gary, you mean that if 90%, that means that at most you can push another 100,000, 150,000 barrel per day?","Gary Simmons","Exactly. So, we've been saying we have about 1.6 million barrels a day of light sweet crude capacity.","Paul Cheng","Secondly that do you expect the Mexico export that you're shipping there that you expect to increase in the coming weeks, given the fuel shortage there? If we look back in the last two months, have you seen any noticeable decline in your gasoline export to Mexico?","Gary Simmons","No, we really haven't. Historically, we see a lot of buying interest in December from Mexico and we see these bottlenecks then trying to get the barrels into the country. And obviously, the crackdown on fuels made that even worse. We're seeing good demand from Mexico, not only waterborne barrels, but we continue to ramp up our business of actually importing the barrels into the country and we're seeing very good demand for barrels delivered all the way in the country as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Manav Gupta","Joe, congrats on a good quarter. And Homer, congrats on joining a great team. We will all miss John Locke and would like to wish him all the best in his new role. So, I just have a quick question on Diamond Green Diesel expansion. Like, if you look at the current margins, is it fair to assume that this is like a 35-plus-percent return for project for you? And the second follow-up on it is, what advantage does Darling Ingredients brings to the table? Are they just a financial partner or they give you some kind of competitive edge on your peers, who are also trying similar projects?","Martin Parrish","This is Martin. On Diamond Green, we're looking at historically -- we think going forward, we're going to be at about $1.25 a gallon, so doing the math, you\u2019re probably in the right ballpark with that return on EBITDA margins. Now, Darling is not just a financial partner. Darling processes about 10% of the world\u2019s meat byproduct. They also do a significant work on collecting used cooking oil. They've been in these markets for years. Diamond Green, we've been in this fat market for 5 years now, 5.5 years, they've been in for a long time. They bring a lot to the table around sourcing the fat pre-treating the fat for the unit. So, it's a really good synergy here. We've got a refining expertise, we've got expertise in marketing a product, they've got pre-treatment expertise and bringing the fat into the joint venture. So, it's a really good partnership.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate","Joe, you guys do a great job of making the sell side look really dumb every quarter; it\u2019s a great quarter, obviously. But my question is a $30 correction in oil prices, obviously there's some lag effect in your capture rate. I'm just curious as to the capture rate move that we saw and off of 100% on our numbers is running about 30%, 40% above what you would normally deliver. Was that just lag effect, or is there something structural going on such as the shift to the lighter grades that we should pay more attention to going forward?","Gary Simmons","Doug, that's a good question.","Joe Gorder","Why don\u2019t I take a shot at it and Gary for recal -- retune whatever I'm saying here. But there is really a few -- couple of reasons. One is as we alluded to in the opening remarks, we've had the pipeline projects. We have the Line 9 and we had the Diamond Pipeline and the Sunrise. And all of those put up the position in the Mid-Continent and in our Quebec refinery position us to take advantage of essentially the distressed markets in the fourth quarter.","And then, the other side of that is on the product side, really lower rent price, allowed us to capture essentially higher net-backs on our product prices. I'm sure, there's a contribution on the other things, like pet coke, all the stuff to contribute our capture rate. But really, the first two things that really drove our capture rate in the fourth quarter.","Doug Leggate","So, should we consider that the capture rate is structurally moving higher?","Joe Gorder","I would say, you should -- on the product side with the lower rent prices, yes. On the crude side, it's just a matter of how distressed those markets are. And you have a line -- you have a view of what [indiscernible] looks like and a view of what Midland looks like and Cushing.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Thank you for trying to answer that. I know it was tough one. My follow-up is really -- is kind of a follow-up to the Doug Terreson\u2019s question, I guess. Normally, we would see this -- the industry pivot obviously between distillate and gasoline to some extent, as you move through the summer, but obviously we've got this IMO even going into 2020. So, I'm wondering, is there a possibility that we see Valero specifically maintain a max distillate bias through the whole of 2019 as one part of the solution to the gasoline overhang? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. ","Lane Riggs","This is Lane again. We absolutely believe that it\u2019ll be the case. I mean, we've been in max distillate for a while now and will continue to be in that way through the at least the way we see the rest of the year going in 2019. Obviously, it\u2019s early but that's the way the forward market is pointing right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Prashant Rao","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back to crude sourcing and drill down a little bit, obviously really strong performance there. And as Paul said, it makes us all look we underestimated you this quarter. On the Maya or other Central American heavy sours, I just want to get a confirmation? I mean, lot of those grades have priced themselves out of the market we saw in 4Q. But were you -- what was your purchasing like in for 4Q and is it -- were you not running as much and should -- how should we expect that to look now that we some price normalization as we go forward in 1Q?","Gary Simmons","So, I think on the heavy side, we've definitely seen that Maya is probably not the best marker for what we're paying for a heavy sour crude. So, in the fourth quarter, if you look Maya was priced at 4.50 discount to Brent. WCS or Western Canadian Select in the U.S. Gulf Coast was trading at a $10.60 discount to Brent. And we believe that the Canadian quote was much more representative of our actual delivered heavy sour into the system. In addition to that, then there were certainly some things with the connect -- disconnect in western Canadian pricing. We had a significant uplift on the crude by rail, we did 43,000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian by rail in Port Arthur, and those were very discounted barrels.","Prashant Rao","Okay, thanks. And I guess that sort of leads nicely to my second question. My follow-up is on the Canadian barrels. It year-to-date seems like the import data and purchasing data, what we've heard the market is -- you continue to be able to get good access to those Canadian barrels. Just wondering if you could give some color on the sourcing, especially given that we've had production cuts up in Canada with the dynamics of those barrels also coming in by rail, or are there more available in the market, just any color on how we should think about the variety of sourcing there?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So, in the fourth quarter, we also set a record on the volume of Canadian heavy that we ran in our system. We ran over 180,000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian. And it is sourced via pipe, delivered into the Gulf, and then we do about 40,000 barrels a day crude by rail. Our view is that crude by rail will be necessary until one of the major pipeline projects gets approved out of western Canada.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Roger Read","I guess, maybe to dig in a little deeper, thinking about the summer time here with gasoline. So, you're running max distillate, presumably most if not all the industry is doing the same. So, if we see, relatively speaking, weaker gasoline cracks this summer, does that imply that to get things in balance effectively, the industry has to employ run cuts or should we think about additional toggles you can do, if you ended up with a summertime situation with stronger distillate cracks relative to the gasoline, especially with IMO staring us in the face by the latter part of the summer?","Joe Gorder","Roger, it\u2019s difficult to answer, certainly thinking of the gasoline situation is a combination of yield, which certainly we expect to be in the max distillate mode. And then, the other thing I\u2019d refer to is just what the utilization rate and the refining capacity is, and whether that 20-year high that we saw last year is sustainable.","Roger Read","Yes. I mean, I would think though with this -- with more light barrels available, there's no reason to think U.S. refines throughout have come off. It\u2019s strictly a margin decision. We heard others companies, other refiners talk about different things you can do in terms of how hard you run your FCC units versus other decisions you can make. I was just curious, if there's anything like that that occurs for IMO as your look at your overall system?","Lane Riggs","This is Lane. I'll take a stab at that. So, we do -- FCC is obviously a pivotal part of our operation, and there's certain inflection point, economic inflection point. And it almost always makes sense fill our alky. So, we\u2019ll run up to the point to make sure alkylation units are full. And so, the marginal capacity we're always looking is to make sense to run-pass that point. And to your point, interestingly enough, the stream that we put in these out also can go into the fuel market for the halfway percent to meet the IMO reg. So, we do think structurally at least one of the things that will happen here is that FCC probably won\u2019t run a whole lot pass, drilling their alky, it\u2019s certainly in the context of how IMO 2020 is going to work out.","Roger Read","And then, Joe, you\u2019ve done a great job over the years here in terms of capital allocation. The decision to roll up VLP kind of brings the balance sheet more into like the true issue on cash and that as opposed to the non-recourse side. I was wondering, as you think about future capital allocation, is there anything you want to do on the balance sheet? Is there a goal to reduce debt here or maybe to increase kind of future flexibility, if you were to pursue anything on the acquisition front?","Joe Gorder","Roger, that's a good question. I would say generally, there isn't anything that we're expecting to change. We set the target within the capital allocation framework debt-to-cap of 20% to 30% range. Donna has got kind of a minimum cash balance target $2 billion, things like that. Those are just things that we operate with is fundamental assumption day in and day out as we go forward. We get asked periodically about, somebody raised the issue about the sustainability of the dividend. And, that's a really interesting question to come up at this point in time. Because in October, we were all being asked what we were going to do with all the cash that IMO 2020 was going to provide.","So, that being said, I think when I look at Valero, I realize that we understand our business and we're making decisions for the long-term based on our strategic view of the market and not hype. And so, we always try to position ourselves financially to be able to deal with whatever the market might be giving us. ","So, if we think in terms of dividend, for example, I can just say without reservation that we consider a sustaining CapEx and the dividend to be totally non-discretionary, and we're going to defend them as we allocate cash. We got a really strong balance sheet, and we certainly wouldn't have raised the dividend if we thought sustainably was any kind of issue there. And really, that's it around that.","From an acquisition perspective, we'll continue to review them in the context of growth projects. And, when you think in terms of the roll up of VLP, it kind of takes you to the question, well, are you going to continue to invest in logistics projects going forward? And the answer to that would be, yes, to the extent the same benefits Valero's business. And if you recall, even with VLP is a publicly traded entity, we always started with a need at Valero. And then, if we did the project to satisfy that need at VLP and take VLP at 12% rate of return, would it still makes sense for Valero to do the project? Okay. That was kind of the calculus that we went through. And if it was yes, we proceeded.","Now, we just look at these projects as an aggregate project. So, the Diamond Pipeline for example, we have a huge benefit on the crude sourcing in the Memphis as a result of the Diamond Pipeline, and VLP was getting the 12% rate of return. Now, all that's rolled in to one set of economics and we look at it in the context of 25% rates of return on refining projects.","So, the way we structured the framework, it's flexible enough to allow us to adjust a little bit from time to time, but it hasn't fundamentally changed what we're doing and what we're focused on.","So that was a really long answer to a pretty simple question, Roger. So sorry about that. ","Roger Read","No, I appreciate that. I just can't believe you accused Wall Street to be in fickle... ","Joe Gorder","Yes. I know it's hard to imagine. Isn\u2019t it?","Roger Read","Absolutely. All right. Thank you. ","Joe Gorder","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Phil Gresh","First question, Joe, would be, you talked for a couple of years now about the illustrative EBITDA that you can generate from these projects that you have under way. And, I think in your slides, you talked about $175 million incremental for 2018 from completed projects. So, I'm wondering how you think about that ramp in 2019 and 2020 that we should be thinking about from the projects underway? ","Joe Gorder","Well, we haven't been that explicit in giving EBITDA forecast for \u201819 and \u201820, right? And I don't think we're going to go there. I think, what you've got to rely on really, Phil, is, is the chart we got in the slide deck. And, if you look at our return threshold for our projects, and you say you're going to invest this much strategic capital year-in and year-out, what kind of EBITDA do you expected to produce? And our numbers are $1 billion to $1.4 billion. And that includes the benefit of the coker project, of our ownership interest in DGD, of all the pipeline to terminal projects going on, the alky and so on. And we're still very, very comfortable with those numbers.","And so, in terms of moving the needle from an EBITDA perspective in light of our capital allocation framework and the clear recognition that capital is a finite resource, we're going to invest in it accordingly, and the projects we're targeting are going to produce $1 billion to $1.5 billion of incremental EBITDA.","Phil Gresh","Okay, fair enough. Second question is just coming back to your comment on the minimum cash balances. If I take your ending 2018, take out $915 million for the VLP volume in the first quarter, I think you're kind of around that $2 billion level. I realize working capital has also been a pretty big headwind in 2018. So, trying to think about that, is there some kind of perhaps reversal that could happen with crude oil prices now going back up? And just generally wondering how you think about that, in the context of the capital return plans and things of that nature?","Joe Gorder","That's a good questions. Donna, do you want to\u2026?","Donna Titzman","Sure. So, in regards to the working capital, I mean, yes. So, to the extent prices would go up, you would see a shift in the more positive direction in 2019. A lot of the negative working capital that you saw in 2018 had to do with some timing on the capital wins that were really due in \u201817 that were pushed to 2018. So, that has sort of evened itself out. But certainly, there are some other movements in the working capital in 2018 that could reverse themselves. ","Phil Gresh","And then, just in terms of VLP taking that down to $2 billion cash balance. So, I mean, you\u2019re basically saying that you\u2019re kind of at the levels you want to manage that or is there flexibility around that $2 billion or how do you think about that target?","Donna Titzman","Clearly, that was a big amount of cash going out in January. But, we're going to continue to make money, generate cash. And so, you should see the cash balance recover. But, again, we're at that $2 billion minimum; we are comfortable here at that level. ","Joe Gorder","Phil, I mean, we\u2019ve said this for years now. We never -- our plan was not to carry $5 billion of cash quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter. And we were just finding ourselves in that situation. And so, there was an intentional plan here to try to tighten this down a little bit. Now, Donna has got our target set. She is the CFO and we're going to try to abide by the target. But, there's no reason for us to sit here with $5 billion of cash on the balance sheet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta","So, Joe, team, I just wanted to start talk a little bit here about IMO 2020. It's funny, we're 40 minutes since the call and it's got a lot less tense than probably six months ago, which is a reflection perhaps of what you've seen in the forward curve where we\u2019ve seen diesel FO; while it's still favorable, has compressed in 2020, 2021. As you look at this dynamic of IMO 2020, has anything changed in the team's mind about the potential upside from it? And just can you talk about how you see it playing itself out through the markets and the sustainability of that tailwind?","Gary Simmons","Sure, Neil. This is Gary. I don't think our view of what will transpire as a result of IMO 2020 has really changed at all. We still see that you'll see a significant uptick in diesel demand and you'll see weakness in the high sulfur fuel oil markets. The shape of the high sulfur fuel curve is pretty much as we assumed it would be. The starting point is a little higher with high sulfur fuel oil trading 94% of Brent today, but you still see steep backwardation in high sulfur fuel oil curve. I think, the one to us that we keep staring at is the ULSD forward curve really isn't showing any IMO impact at all. And we still believe there will be significant demand increases as a result of IMO and strong diesel cracks as a result of that as you approach that January 2020 date.","Neil Mehta","I appreciate that. And then, the other follow-up and that will be about good -- is RINs, just your thoughts on that market. Again, it seems like something we haven't paid as much attention to lately, prices have been lower for a period of time here. Is there any risk that you see in the RINs market that could send prices higher, and just your thoughts on how it plays out from here?","Jason Fraser","Yes. This is Jason. Just from a policy side, we don't see any seismic shift come in. I mean, the EPA has several rule-makings. They\u2019re looking at the E15 waiver for the upcoming summer for the ethanol guys to give more ability to put more in the market, tied with the market reform aspects. Some rules have been hopefully improved the functioning of the RIN market within RFS reset. But, what's happened is those have all gotten stalled out with the government shutdown. So, we don't see any change in course, more just a delay right now, but I don't see any big catalyst to change things.","Lane Riggs","And then, the small refiner exemption is another piece of this, right? And the EPA followed the rules last year and got a small refiner exemptions where they were appropriate. And that certainly took some of the pressure off the RIN market also. We expect them to continue to follow the rules to comply with the legislation as it's crafted and issue the small refiner exemptions where they are appropriate. And so, Neil, I'm with Jason. I don't see a whole of change in this market going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Mizuho. Your line is open.","Paul Sankey","Joe, this is good result obviously in Q4, but it feels like a tremendous number of things have changed into Q1 equally, so that your comments about gasoline for example. It's not a good time in January to sort of turn bearish. Can you talk a little bit about what the really big earnings impact changes have been? And obviously, I'm thinking about OPEC cuts, Alberta cuts, Venezuela, gasoline markets. It's just a very different environment. How do you expect things to progress in some of those things through 2019, and how different is the environment even in January compared to this very good result in Q4? Thanks.","Joe Gorder","So, Paul, I mean, that's a very good question. And you hit on the point. I mean, it is a very interesting market because there are so many moving parts right now. But, the thing that we always have to keep in mind is that January always stinks. Gasoline is usually weak at this point in time. If the winter is warm, distillates not too salty. A lot of times, Paul, we've been at your conference in the past in January when everybody wanted to slip their risk because things were so miserable. Right? But the reality is, is that we're managing our business for the long term. And we have been in this for a very long time and we understand the cycles in the business.","And so what do you do? You make adjustments day-in and day-out in your operations to try to deal with this and to be as profitable as possible. I mean, Lane mentioned some of the things we'll do around cash. Gary has changed in the way he's sourcing crude, on a weekly, daily basis to try to get the best net-back that we can in the plant.","The things that we don't change. We don't change our commitment to the things that make Valero really good, which is operating safely, reliably, honoring environmental stewardship, managing our capital appropriately. Those are the things we can control and that we pay a lot of attention to. Day-in and day-out optimization based on certain market conditions, okay, we're all over that too. But, we don't have a crystal ball. And so we just manage the business for the long-term and we do our best. Lane, you or Gary, want to talk any specifics around that?","Lane Riggs","One thing I would add on Venezuela, Venezuela at some point going to have to put oil on the market, even if these sanctions stay in place. So, there's going to be a balancing time through here where whoever buy any alternatives, they'll build buy Venezuelan oil and oil will come to our market. So, I mean, it will also allow you just sort of in a interim time period here where that's got to play out. And of course, if something changes in Venezuela, then it's just back to status quo. On OPEC, OPEC is clearly going to be looking at trying to set the amount of oil in the market based on what are the markets and what's the structure of the market. And again, as Joe alluded to, every day we wake up and we do -- we optimize our assets around what's available out there. We have a great system better than anyone in the markets to get the most value and understand these markets.","Paul Sankey","Great. Thanks, guys. And Joe, I greatly appreciate, shot out for our January refining conference. Saying that you are the only major refining out there this year, but do you remember that we've got our -- don't forget we've got our Napa Valley Energy Summit on the 1st and 2nd of April, and you're most welcome to join us in [Multiple speakers]. Apologies for the shameless plug.","Joe Gorder","Paul, I would expect nothing less. And if you are buying, all I can see, we can make it work.","Paul Sankey","I appreciate that, guys. Thanks very much indeed.","Joe Gorder","Thanks, Paul. Take care.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Brad Heffern","Lane, I was just hoping you could sort of expand on the comments that you just made about crude sourcing. I mean, it seems like all the numbers we see on the screen for pretty much anything sour waterborne, it's just not the math that you would normally expect. So, is Mars at minus 2 or Oriente at minus 4? Are those crudes actually pricing their way into the system or is there a chance that in the sort of interim period where the trade routes are sort of getting really drawn that we see cut and runs just because the mediums and the heavies are not competitive?","Lane Riggs","So, I'll take a shot at it and Gary obviously can tune me. Today, where we are is the most profitable crude that we run is our sweets. And then, it's sort of medium and heavy, you are sort of at parity with one another. And it depends on what part of your refinery is trying to sellout. But on the Mars, like the last barrels we try to run on the system where it's really sweet and they all still have margin, positive margin to an open crude unit. So, it's just really trying to navigate and get the right dive into our assets. In terms of just the way trade routes are deploying. I think, again, as I said, I mean, OPEC cuts, they aren't always going to be cuts. And we got to watch how Venezuela plays out on the sanction side. It's just like what happens when around, same thing. So, these all worked, they're not the permanent trade we pass, but the world rebalances when these things happen.","Brad Heffern","And then, I was just wondering if you could give any color on your union contracts. Obviously, the steel workers union negotiations going on right now and the contract expires tomorrow. So, I know you guys didn't have any impact four years ago, the last time that we saw this, but just curious if what do you expect this time around.","Joe Gorder","Sure. So, Shell is really negotiating on behalf of the industry for the pattern bargaining. In terms of Valero, we have two refineries, I think actually tonight at 12 midnight that these contracts expire. And we have two refineries that these contracts will expire that is our Memphis refinery and Port Arthur. We have a tentative agreement with our Memphis refinery right now in terms of just sort of local agreement, pending the sort of the Shell negotiations. And we're still working on our issues at Port Arthur. We don't expect a work stoppage during this whole process, but you just never know. So, we're prepared for that. We have a completely trained temporary workforce to take over the assets in the event that there is a walk out. But, I'm not trying to say we're going have one, but we're certainly prepared for it, as you would expect us to be.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Craig Shere","So, picking up on Neil's IMO 2020 question. I just wonder if you could speak to the expanding wastewater regulations that appear to be limiting the option of ship-based scrubbers.","Lane Riggs","Hi. This is Lane. I think what you're asking about, there are some of these environment -- there are some sort of ports that are saying they're not allowing the discharges. Is that what you are talking about?","Craig Shere","Exactly.","Lane Riggs","Yeah. So, again, that just makes it a little more difficult for the ships to invest in scrubbers. I mean, again the technology takes the SOX out of the air and puts it into the water. And I think some of these local ports are fully aware of that. It's just another headwind in terms of making it more difficult to try to solve this long range problem out of IMO, which is this really heavy bitumen that's historically been burning these ships and there's only a few other pathway to try to get rid of it. And as Gary mentioned, that's where you really see the forward market trying to understand exactly how it's going to happen is that particular strength.","Craig Shere","So, would you agree that that's just another data point suggesting a perhaps deeper and more prolonged benefit to the refineries?","Lane Riggs","Exactly. That's exactly right.","Craig Shere","And also, just picking up on Roger's M&A balance sheet question. 2018 was a robust acquisition year. We had the ethanol plants, the Peruvian terminaling and the VLP rollup obviously. Do you think that convergence was just a one-off event or do you see ongoing opportunities that can continue to soak up cash balance?","Joe Gorder","Craig, I mean, our practice is not to really kind of foretell what we're looking at from a acquisition perspective. But, I can tell you, there is nothing on the radar screen at this point in time. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities as they arise, but we don't have any pressing need to fix our business sort of fill that gap with acquired assets. I can't call it coincidental, because we made the decision to do the acquisitions last year, right? So, it's far from a coincidence. But the facts are we saw some opportunities that we felt satisfied our strategic interest, and that really was to extend our supply chain and to continue to grow one of our businesses, the ethanol business, buying assets that were priced very-attractively in the market. And so, we took advantage of the opportunity. But, I'm going to tell you there -- I would not model for a repeat act in 2019.","Craig Shere","So, barring ongoing strong M&A and relatively steady billion dollar growth CapEx, robust margins like we're seeing and the opportunity for IMO 2020, it seems like if anything is going to flex, it's going to be the share buybacks, which we saw in the fourth quarter?","Joe Gorder","Yes, sir.","Craig Shere","Okay, good. Thank you very much.","Joe Gorder","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open.","Matthew Blair","Homer, did you say 3.8 on ethanol throughput guidance for Q1? And if so, does that reflect any economic run cuts or maybe a big turnaround or something else going on?","Martin Parrish","Well, this is Martin Parrish. Yes, we have cut back a little bit or run in all our plants, so we had some cut back a little bit. There's just not much fund in it right now. But, we take a long-term view and we expect things to turn around. Ethanol demand in the U.S. is going to grow marginally, and export demand way up this year, and we expect that to continue, it's more mandates worldwide, and even better than that just blending economics worldwide for ethanol where it's priced. And we just don't think that can stay that way where ethanol prices is cheap. So, that's the plan.","Matthew Blair","And then, I was also hoping you could talk about Octane in upcoming alky expansion. When we look at Gulf Coast octane spreads coming in around $5 a barrel, a couple of years ago that was more like $10 to $12 a barrel. So, is the alky unit -- what are the economics on today's pricing, and would you expect a widening octane spread going forward?","Lane Riggs","This is Lane. So, our Houston alky will come on stream in the second quarter. Our FID decision, I think, the EBITDA will come around 105 million or something like that. So, I'd have to go back and look and see where compare now. But, we are still committed with the idea that A, going forward octane is going to be more valuable. There's a couple of reasons for that. One is the auto is going higher octane; and two, you still haven't seen tier 3. All this tier 3 investment get in and sort of potentially pressure the octane. And then, finally, just all this light crude puts a lot in that out there. So, all that put together, essentially, we believe that octane is going to be valuable. Where it is versus our funding decisions, where we just have to check, but we still feel like it's a good project. And the same true for our St. Charles, Alkylation project.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Weiland with US Capital Advisors. Your line is open.","Craig Weiland","Yes. Hi. Good morning, and thank you for fitting my question, and congrats on the great quarter. You have about a quarter of your Gulf Coast refining capacity located in Eastern Louisiana. And it looks like probably bridge is about to start up here, start delivering barrels into St. James at some point, maybe this quarter, also a slew of other proposed projects that have been introduced in recent weeks and months, designed to move crude into that market over the next couple of years. So, I'm curious, if you could elaborate on how you think Valero's crude procurement options will develop on the back of these projects and what type of impact they could have on your Gulf Coast feedstocks. I appreciate any color you can share.","Gary Simmons","Yes. I think, the biggest thing for us in the eastern Gulf is St. Charles is obviously a heavy sour refinery, and getting better access to heavy Canadian crude would be a big advantage for us there. And so, we're certainly looking at some of the projects that are out there, namely the Capline reversal has a potential to be able to get more cost effective heavy sour crude in to St. Charles is a big benefit to our system.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Your line is open.","Jason Gabelman","Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Just a couple of questions. A follow-up on the comments about running the FCCs, just to maximize alky production. The inputs into the FCCs, are those able to be blended into the marine fuel pool, or is there from a technical standpoint, an issue with meeting marine fuel specs, if you try to blend that backing gas oil into the marine pool?","Lane Riggs","Hey, Jason. This is Lane. So, yes, the fees, particularly the marginal fee which is low sulfur VGO into these FCCs will fit into the half-a-way percent fuel oil market.","Jason Gabelman","Okay, great. And there's not an issue with any of the other specs outside of meeting the sulfur spec?","Lane Riggs","We've done a lot of work in terms of blends, making sure that there's some compatibility. There is not -- the spec for is not that rigorous. It really ends up being -- there's just sulfur spec. So, really what you really got to be careful of is for something that you do to the blend that creates compatibility. I'm pretty confident, ultimately, industry will work through all that. It's not to say that really on there won't be some of those issues. We've worked with some of these people to try to work on our own blends around that. So, that's really the only issue this potentially could have.","Jason Gabelman","And just looking more near term, obviously 4Q benefited from some better capture than anticipated and trying to figure out if that could continue into the first quarter. One area I think where there could be some upside is on the butane blending. It looks like butane prices have fallen pretty hard against where gasoline prices are. Do you expect that to support capture rates in the first quarter relative to its support in prior first quarters?","Gary Simmons","Yes. We see the spread. But, it's not a real meaningful contribution to our overall earnings for the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Homer Bhullar for closing remarks.","Homer Bhullar","Thanks, Shannon. We appreciate everyone joining us.

With me are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Joe Gorder, President and COO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer; Kim Bowers, President of Retail and several other members of our senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.","Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the Company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Okay, so as noted in the release, we reported fourth quarter 2012 earnings up $1 billion, or $1.82 per share. This includes a non-cash asset impairment loss of $37 million after taxes, or $0.06 per share, which is primarily related to permanently canceled capital projects at certain of our refineries. This is our highest forward curve quarter earnings per share since 2005.","For the full-year 2012, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.1 billion, or $3.75 per share. Included in these results were non-cash asset impairment losses of $983 million after taxes, or $1.77 per share, and severance expense of $41 million after taxes, or $0.07 per share mainly related to the shutdown and impairment of the Aruba refinery.","Operating income was $1.6 billion versus operating income of $167 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in operating income was mainly due to higher refining margins in each of our refining regions; partially offsetting the operating income was a significant decline in ethanol margins.","Our fourth quarter refining throughput margin was $12.27 per barrel, which is a large increase versus a fourth quarter of 2011 margin, which was $5.46 per barrel. The increase in refining throughput margin was mainly due to wider discounts on medium sour, heavy sour, and domestic light crude oils.","For example, comparing the fourth quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2012, the Brent less Mars medium sour discounts improved by nearly $3 per barrel, Brent less Maya heavy sour discount improved by over $11 per barrel, and the Brent less WTI domestic light discount improved by nearly $7 per barrel.","Our fourth quarter 2012 refining throughput volume averaged $2.64 million barrels per day, down 73,000 barrels per day from the fourth quarter of 2011 mainly due to the lack of throughput volume at the Aruba refinery, which was shutdown in the first quarter of 2012.","Refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2012 were $3.73 per barrel, which was in line with the third quarter of 2012, slightly below our guidance due mainly to lower than expected energy costs.","Before I cover retail and ethanol, I\u2019d like to highlight several other items in our refining operations. First, we had a smooth and successful start-up in December of our new hydrocracker at Port Arthur, which was our largest project in company history. Since mid-December, the unit has been operating at approximately 50,000 barrels per day and has performed well.","Last week, we conducted performance test with the technology provider and we have begun rate test that should enable us to operate the unit at or near the permitted maximum rate of approximately 57,000 barrels per day.","We are continuing to work on new hydrocracker project at our St. Charles Refinery. We expect to complete that unit and begin operations in the second quarter of 2013. Both of these hydrocrackers were designed to take advantage of the current environment of strong diesel margins and cheap natural gas. Also, in the fourth quarter, we completed and started up our products pipeline that runs from Quebec Refinery to Montr\u00e9al.","Our retail business reported fourth quarter 2012 operating income of $95 million, consisting of $78 million in the U.S. and $17 million in Canada, where we took a $9 million non-cash asset impairment loss per retail stores in Canada. For the year, our retail business generated $348 million of operating income, making it our second best year in history and nearly as high as last year\u2019s record setting level of $381 million.","Retail fuel volumes in both regions declined slightly compared to fourth quarter 2011 as weak gasoline demand impacted sales. U.S. retail merchandise sales were higher than on flat merchandise margins in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus the fourth quarter of 2011. Canada retail merchandise sales and margins were down slightly in the fourth quarter of 2012 versus the fourth quarter of 2011.","Our plan to separate our retail business and unlock value for our shareholders is progressing. Earlier this month, CST Brands, Inc. formally known as Corner Store Holdings, Inc. filed an amended registration statement with the SEC. In summary, our plan is to distribute 80% of the shares in CST Brands to Valero shareholders and Valero will receive approximately $1.1 billion in cash and incur a tax liability of approximately $300 million primarily in Canada. We expect to liquidate the remaining 20% of CST Brands outstanding shares within 18 months of the distribution. Regarding timing, we expect the retail distribution will occur in the second quarter of 2013, but that assumes a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS in clearing all comments from the SEC.","We believe the separated retail business will perform well and unlock the value for shareholders for several reasons. So first, CST Brands will be the second largest publicly traded independent retailer of fuel and convenience merchandize in North America with nearly 1,900 sites.","Second, these sites are located in geographically diverse regions; the Southwestern United States and Eastern Canada. Third, many of these 1,032 U.S. retail sites are in Texas and surrounding states, which have strong economic growth.","Fourth, CST Brands have substantial ownership of the sites with approximately 60% owned and not leased. Fifth, there is a long history of strong financial performance in brand recognition. And finally, CST Brands have significant growth opportunities in merchandize, food service, and new build locations.","Our Ethanol segment reported operating income of $12 million, which was down $169 million from the fourth quarter of 2011, mainly due to much lower gross margins at high corn prices and excess ethanol inventories squeeze margins to lower levels.","Production averaged 2.7 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2012 for a decline of nearly 800,000 gallons per day compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","Until margins improve, we expect reduction rates to remain well below capacity with three of our plants temporarily idle. In the fourth quarter of 2012, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $189 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense was $402 million and net interest expense was $70 million, all in line with company guidance. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 34%. ","Regarding cash flows in the fourth quarter, capital spending was $942 million which includes $140 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. That brings our full year capital spending including $479 million for turnaround and catalyst expenditures to $3.4 billion or $100 million below our guidance. Also in the fourth quarter, we paid $97 million in cash dividends to our shareholders and bought 4.2 million shares for $133 million in cash. For the full-year 2012, we purchased 10.6 million shares of Valero stock with $280 million of cash.","With respect to our balance sheet at the end of December, total debt was $7 billion, cash was $1.7 billion, and our debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 22.7%. At the end of December, we had nearly $5.7 billion of available liquidity in addition to cash. ","We expect our 2013 capital spending to be consistent with our prior estimate of $2.5 billion, and this includes approximately $200 million for our retail segment. Our 2013 estimate also include spending to complete the St. Charles hydrocracker project, which has a total expected cost of approximately $1.6 billion or an increase of approximately $100 million from our previous estimate.","Looking at the economic growth portion of our 2013 capital spending estimate, we're focused on three strategic areas. The first area is logistics and the spending is spread across our refining system for railcars, rail unloading facilities, pipelines, storage and terminals. The objective is to increase our access to more volumes of discounted U.S. and Canadian crude oils. The second strategic area is for modifications to our refineries that increase the flexibility to export products to premium markets and to process more of discounted crude oils, particularly domestic light crude. And the third strategic area is for expanding our distillate focused hydrocrackers Port Arthur, St. Charles and Meraux.","Regarding other uses of cash in 2013, we retired $180 million of 6.7% senior notes that matured in mid-January and we expect to retire $300 million of maturing notes in the second quarter of 2013. Last week, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend rate by $0.025 per share or 14% to $0.20 per share or $0.80 on an annualized basis, which is our highest level in company history. This increase reflects our positive outlook for Valero and our commitment to return more cash to shareholders. ","On the macro side, we continue to believe many of Valero\u2019s refineries have several competitive advantages versus other Atlantic basin refiners including low cost natural gas, increasing access to discounted domestic crude oil, and lager more complex and reliable refineries. These advantages have enabled us to compete both domestic and foreign markets and operate at higher utilization rates versus less competitive Atlantic basin refiners. ","For modeling our first quarter operations, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. The Gulf Coast at 1.4 million to 1.5 million barrels per day, Midcontinent at 390,000 to 400,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 245,000 to 255,000 barrels per day, and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. Refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter are expected to be around $4 per barrel. ","Regarding our ethanol operations in the first quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 2.4 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon, including $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.","Also we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation to be around $170 million and net interest expense should be around $85 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter should be around $405 million and our effective tax rate in the first quarter should be approximately 35%.","Okay, Trish, we have concluded our opening remarks. We will now open the call for questions. I do want to advise callers that our goal is to keep the duration of the call to about an hour. Therefore, we're going to ask that you limit your each turn on asking questions to two questions. If you have additional question, you can hop back into the queue. Okay, Trish.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Good morning.","Bill Klesse","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","You guys had a strong quarter throughputs for better than expected cash operating costs lower, but I wanted to focus on gross margin in the Gulf Coast. I assume that feedstock advantages probably flow through and contributed to a very strong margin capture. Could you talk about, any one-time events, or talk about how feedstock changes could be sustainable in continuing strong margin capture. Any step function change in U.S. crude, or Canadian crude influence in the fourth quarter?","Joe Gorder","Jeff, this is Joe, good morning to you too. Yeah, we did well in the Gulf Coast. I mean, if you look at the slate that we ran, we ran more of heavy sour and medium sours in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter.","So and you actually mentioned during his comments what those discounts look like and they were very strong. We also rail lot more reserves, and while we ran a bit more reserves in the quarter, but we ran reserves with better pricing than we had in the third quarter. A lot of that had to do with the fact that the alluvial production was back on stream.","So basically the guys did a just a very good job of optimizing the crude and feedstocks late into the plants. You know, actually in the quarter, we continue to push run more domestic light sweet crude which we were up over, I think 700,000 barrels a day. So all in, if you look at the crude slate, we had discounted crudes coming in really every form.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","How do you see your feedstock changing with the addition of seaway having started up, I think for middle 250 and the Permian pipes coming on late March or April, an incremental rail coming into the market? How do you see those benefiting you in the first quarter and second quarter going forward?","Joe Gorder","Well, I think clearly we are getting access to more crews, right? And we mentioned I think in the notes that we were a 100% domestic light sweet crude, where we are running sweet crudes in the Gulf, so we back off all of our foreign dollars. And seaway has had an impact Jeff as you know, but they are not running at the rates that have been anticipated, and I think that\u2019s why we see that LLS is still trading at a bit of a premium to brand. I think as you get seaway up to speed and then we\u2019ve got significant additional projects that are going to bring more crude into the Gulf through 2013, you will end up seeing Brent trading at that discount that we are all expecting to LLS going forward, okay.","As we run light sweet crudes in lane and Bill can speak to the projects that we are looking at, I think he knows some of those to allow us to run more light sweet crudes, we are going to be in beneficiaries of that.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co.","Thank you, Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Doug, your line is open.","Bill Klesse","Doug, whenever you are ready.","Joe Gorder","All right. You might have to hop in next. Trish, can you move to our next caller?","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning, guys, great quarter of today.","Bill Klesse","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, just maybe a follow-up on some of those projects, I mean you mentioned fourth quarter placed the important lights with domestics and the Gulf Coast in Memphis, and pursuing several options. So I think I believe you are considering condensate splitter, clearly at Gulf Coast we will see more condensate moving out of the Eagle Ford, Rail was mentioned as an option that would \u2013 I think increase in viability if Keystone is delayed or blocked. I mean could you comment just generally on what those projects are because of cost magnitude to mention maybe the logistics spending that will be important as well as that could be put into different structure? And whether any expenses are currently included in that $960 million of strategic 2013 CapEx?","Bill Klesse","All right. Well, Evan, good morning. We are looking at a lot of real projects. And in the logistics capital, if I look at the logistics capital that we have in the 2013 budget is a lot of it has to do with dock capacity, logistics, sure that we have the ability to export the volumes that we\u2019ve got.","We think today, we can put 225,000 barrels a day gasoline on the water and we\u2019re looking at ways to increase that at St. Charles at Port Arthur  These all we think we can move to 80 a day and we\u2019re looking at projects to take that up to over 400 barrels a day.","So a lot of the capital that we have and the capital forecast is for that. In addition, we announced that we bought the railcars and we\u2019re working projects to figure out where we want to take this crude with these railcars. I mean we certainly have somethings in mind, but we are looking at projects, for example, at St. Charles to rail crude in.","We\u2019ve got a project that rail crude into Quebec. We\u2019ve got the two West Coast refinery that we\u2019re looking at rail options for. And then Memphis we think we can rail a significant amount of crude in domestic. So we\u2019re working all those options and the guys are going through the overall logistics strategy for that including potentially additional railcars. So as far as the capital attributed to it, right now we don\u2019t have anything identified above the plan.","Joe Gorder","","Yeah.","Bill Klesse","So all those things just to clarify, all those things Joe was talking about, I mean those are included in our strategic growth category which is just under $1 billion for 2013.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","That's great. And in terms of Memphis, you say that you were, you back at all foreign imports there. So I presume used kind of Capline. What are you running there and what is \u2013 how is it getting there and is there any yield pickup from the slight change at Memphis that's improved its profitability?","Kim Bowers","","I'll speak to the crude supply piece and maybe Lane want to talk to the yield improvements. But we are running Bakken, it\u2019s \u2013 really still coming up Capline, and so we haven't changed the method of delivery into that refinery right now. We are looking at waterborne deliveries into Memphis going forward. Right now, the economics have supported continue to use Capline. ","Lane Riggs","So this is Lane Riggs. In terms of the quality of Bakken, it\u2019s really normally around LLS, but I would say because LLS historically have been a blended barrel made from a number of different components, Bakken is a neat barrel and it's been much in terms of its ratability and our ability to steady our operations around running it. We are certainly getting the benefit of a more steady crude diet, it\u2019s lighter so it's really its value versus the LLS directly function of what the gas frac is, but normally it's slightly \u2013 just today its slightly just kind of a quality basis to LLS. For us though we are getting quite a bit of value just out of the steady operation running Bakken need to our refinery standout to Memphis.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. I'll be there guys. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","We have Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, can you hear me now guys. ","Bill Klesse","We can.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I apologize. Technical problem. I hope I didn\u2019t get my course of questions taking here. I wanted to follow-up on Jeff\u2019s, if I may real quick and then I\u2019ll got a follow-up. I guess this question is really for Joe, but as you see the light sweet bar increase in terms of volume in the Gulf Coast, what\u2019s happening to the relationship as you see it for heavy crude particularly as it relates to this historical discount to LLS and what I\u2019m really trying to get out is, if you eventually see LLS move to discount to Brent, do you expect the heavy medium sour oils could maintain their relationship with LLS or not with the discount. I\u2019m just curious as to how you see that playing out and then I\u2019ll got a follow-up please.","Joe Gorder","Well, that\u2019s a good question, Bill and\u2026","Bill Klesse","So I\u2019ll answer it. The way we actually look at it, we would agree that if LLS goes to a discount of Brent, which we expect to happen, the world crude is still Brent. So heavy crude will sell at a discount, but the discount against LLS will narrow but you\u2019ll still have an acceptable discount against Brent. So going into a sunk coker we think that you\u2019ll have economics to do that but not to build the grass roots coker.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So what\u2019s the logic now of expanding your ability to process light crude if the heavy crude is going to move to the same discount as the light if you would I mean?","Bill Klesse","Just because of the availability, we\u2019ll see at Keystone actually gets filled. But as you can see in the press today, enterprises having trouble moving the oil, once it gets to Houston. so we have a lot of availability and personally, we\u2019ve said that the discount and I know its different today, okay? The discount LLS against Brent will move to several dollars at least tariffs, but it could move more. And those will be attractive to run that, but it\u2019s read, it\u2019s just so available where the heavy barrels are having to be imported. So now you start to look around and as I said it depends on what have to a Keystone. But as you begin to look around, the Mexican volumes are moving in different directions, you have the Venezuelan volumes moving different directions, you do have increases in Columbia. So we just manage the supply function here and think the light crude is going to be readily available.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, nice for the full answer, Bill. My follow-up is probably something that you\u2019ve been asked a lot about recently, but your free cash flow obviously steps up this year. You had made this comment again in your rounding statement about having the competitively highest yield in the sector. Can you just help us understand what was framing that, the scale of ultimately what you think between your dividend policy and buybacks? And I guess you could bring into the answer perhaps shares that you issued in the middle of the crisis in terms of whether or not but I don\u2019t know that would prioritize buybacks over dividend increases and I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Bill Klesse","Well, Doug, I think we clearly have demonstrated the management team that we return cash to the shareholders. You go back to 2006, 2007, when we did not have better opportunities, we bought a lot of shares which we did get some criticism for, but actually we didn\u2019t have better projects, so we returned cash to the shareholders.","So we\u2019ve demonstrated our ability to return cash to the shareholder. In the last two years, we purchased 27 million shares. We\u2019ve increased our dividend several times. We continue to buy our shares, because we think our shares are undervalued. We do not think the market is giving us credit for this distribution of our retail businesses. But on the other hand, we\u2019re going to maintain our investment grade rating, we think it\u2019s very important for a company of our size. I actually mentioned, we\u2019re paying off about $500 million of debt here in the first half. And with this volatility that we have in the marketplace today, we are going to hold more cash. So a couple of our projects are slightly behind, obviously as we said, we\u2019re a $100 million over from our previous guidance at St. Charles hydrocracker. So we\u2019re going to make sure we finish all that.","Then what we tend to do is look at our balanced approach to everything. In our business, this is a very capital intensive long lead time of business. And if we believe that we can add more shareholder value than we can looking at our stock price today, then we make these investments.","So we tend to have balance in our approach. You ask about the approximate 50 million shares that we issued in, I guess the second quarter of 2009. And sure, we would like to take those out. And everybody that supported us at that time sure, have a nice return as well. And but it\u2019s not a goal for say, it\u2019s more of our, the stock is undervalued, and we\u2019ll have a balanced approach.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","We appreciate the answer Bill, thanks.","Bill Klesse","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Kessler from Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the dynamics you are seeing along the Gulf Coast and that is, are you getting a widening spread in the East versus West costal price of light, I mean you\u2019re getting a deeper price for light crude to say, Corpus than Houston, and now at seaway a discount \u2013 a deeper discount at Houston versus Louisiana. And what do you expect to happen with that East West spread going forward? And then are there any limits to exploiting a lighter spread should want to emerge?","Gene Edwards","Rob, you\u2019re wrong. I mean your description of the market is what we\u2019re seeing. I mean Corpus crude is trading less than Houston crude, and Houston crude is less than St. James. So where we expect going forward, I think if St. James is going to be Bakken based, it\u2019s always going to price more than Eagle Ford into Corpus or the Mid-Continent crude to Permian crude into Houston.","Bill Klesse","So I would add to that that as long as these areas are long, so for instance, I\u2019d like to say Corpus Christi is long, Eagle Ford crude thus it has to move, and it\u2019s going to move with the tariff and some timing deltas. So the clearing places St. James now for LLS, so you\u2019re going to have differentials toward Houston and differentials towards St. James. What you have to have the supply demand imbalance in those markets, the minute the market flips to short than the tariff turns around.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","And then theoretically barge capacity to exploit the spread if one persistent for long enough to want to put money to work in inventory on the water to take advantage of that?","Joe Gorder","Yeah, I would say, I don\u2019t know if there is enough barge capacity truly.","Bill Klesse","Well, I think your question is, when you store all along the barge to take advantage or you start make them shipping it.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","Yeah, I just \u2013 to me when you have a spread like that potentially emerge in that, you guys would seem to be as best places anyone to be able to take advantage of it and I just don\u2019t know, is there some limiting factor, I am not thinking of whether it\u2019s loading, unloading along the coast that kind of circumvent would might be in place already in the pipeline side, is there some kind of storage bottleneck. I just want, what could be a limiting factor that I will be thinking of and your ability to displace that dislocation and offset it in your system?","Bill Klesse","Well, I would assume others are doing what we are doing. We are fixing docks, we are increasing our capability, so if Corpus Christi come, the second quarter we will be able to load a lot more onto water. Lead time for railcars is a year to 18 months, lead time on barges is a year. ","Joe Gorder","Yes.","Bill Klesse","A year, so I think it just tells you by those lead times that those type of assets are short or tight.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","","Second question from me, when you look at Western Canada Select or bitumen in Canada in general in the spread versus say, Maya in the Gulf, it seems like rail is in no [brainier]? And so you guys ordered a couple of thousand more railcars, some of those will be bit forward moving that crude down. Was about a year turnaround time I think on a new railcar. Why would could that not just accelerate to an exponential degree and where do you see that developing and say, in just overall market, rail lot of Alberta say down in the Gulf Coast and a year or two years time and how much will Valero participate in that?","Bill Klesse","Well, I think Joe answered you earlier said, we are looking at rail at St. James, St. Charles, so that\u2019s the Louisiana.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","Yeah.","Bill Klesse","And so we are doing it. Clearly, we are looking at rail in the Southern California just like all our competitors are as well. So as far as exponential, there is no question rail is growing very rapidly by every single company and part of it is because of the uncertainty surrounding some of the pipelines and a long lead time that seems to be developing. But the supply is there and the market demand is in these refining centers and you would not get any argument from us, or I think any of our competitors since all of us are buying railcars that this is the big part of our future and this business is your logistics capability to move to stress crude oils through your refineries.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","So if you are in 12 to 18 months time if the market was moving 200,000 to 400,000 barrels a day out of Alberta by rail that wouldn\u2019t surprise you?","","Bill Klesse","I don\u2019t know the numbers I think as well as you do, but it does not surprise me to be a lot of railcars, I just don\u2019t know those kind of numbers.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","Sure, okay.","Bill Klesse","Okay, but\u2026","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","Well, thanks for your comment.","Bill Klesse","But we\u2019re looking at the same thing that I\u2019m sure you here from the other people.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","Gotcha. Thank you, guys.","Bill Klesse","Sure, Robert.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Garcia from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Cory Garcia \u2013 Raymond James","Good morning, Klesse.","Bill Klesse","Good morning, Cory.","Cory Garcia \u2013 Raymond James","Just kind of one quick question, you guys alluded to in your slide deck regarding your Port Arthur hydrocracker that you\u2019ve been seeing from higher quality diesel and actually some better distilled yields overall. Just wondering how we should kind of think about that today as it normalize back towards your expectations of, I think I want to say, closer to 60%, or have you maintained the high level and really how we sort of get that around in terms of modeling?","Lane Riggs","Hi, Cory, this is Lane Riggs. Right now what we are doing this test run as Ashley alluded to in his opening remarks. We\u2019re at about 80% distillate yield, that take care of what distillate. Our diesel index, our CT index going off the units about 62 on the diesel, which is much better than we had anticipated, the properties on the (inaudible) grade. So certainly these are great distillate yield and a great product for our products if I figure out where this is safe to market.","Bill Klesse","So we\u2019ve got new catalyst, so we\u2019ve got high activity...","Lane Riggs","Right, (inaudible) business.","Bill Klesse","And we think that this unit will run till we have to replace catalysts.","Lane Riggs","3 years.","Bill Klesse","Three years. So there will be some degradation over that period.","Lane Riggs","That\u2019s right.","Cory Garcia \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Yeah. Good morning, and again, congratulations on the quarter. You\u2019ve talked a little bit about, just specifically in the quarter, sourcing more heavy oil, can you talk a little bit about where are those mediums and heavies are coming from? I mean, is this incremental Canadian barrels, is it kind of, let\u2019s call it Western Hemisphere, is it some out of Middle East, is it a mix of the above? And then as you\u2019re looking forward, we clearly are going to have more heavy sour capacity coming on globally. I was just curious, is it ultimately we need keystone, we need rail, or is there something else you\u2019re looking at in terms of sourcing those mediums and those heavies?","Joe Gorder","Okay. The heavy barrels, I mean we\u2019ve got them out of South America and Mexico, okay. And our normal suppliers, we increased our volumes from Venezuela and from Mexico both. I would say that, I would say there was nothing unusual about the sources of supply of these barrels other than the economics associated with running them versus not running them. We are bringing some heavy sour Canadian crudes into Port Arthur, and we\u2019re running that. But we didn\u2019t have any material change in the volumes there.","So and then if I step forward to what you\u2019re talking about going forward. we want heavy sour crude in the Gulf Coast. Keystone pipeline is the most economical way for us to do that. We are still fully supportive of the pipeline and we want to see it happen. Second to that, then you look at other alternatives to get heavy sours up and we continue to look at those, as their capacity on Enbridge, their ability to take the crude into Hartford and then barge it down to St. Charles, which we tend to be doing somehow, can we do more of that. ","And then rail, of course, we don't know exactly what those numbers might be today, but we're looking it. We have \u2013 needed railcars and we're looking at the ability to move heavy sour Canadian's to be a rail. So we're looking at all the options there Roger.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And the follow-up question looking at the hydrocrackers, obviously we now look at the price of the various products, if I was understood it correctly there is really sensitivity to natural gas as feedstock and power source. Can you walk us through what we should really think about the full quarter contribution in Port Arthur and obviously as we see the ramp up at St. Charles as well. What are the big things we should watch here on the price side to really determine the economics of these.","Gene Edwards","","Yeah, Roger there are several key drivers, natural gas is one of them, diesel is one of them, overall crude is one of them. We've got sensitivities for barrel and the appendix to our standard IR slide deck. To give you a feel for how it\u2019s been running, it's been running at these planned test rates around 50,000 barrels a day. And so far in January where the market has been with low gasoline cracks, but good diesel cracks and pretty cheap natural gas, EBITDA has been up around between $20 and $25 a barrel and we've been running it about 50,000 barrels a day. So it\u2019s been pretty much what we expected. And this is kind of a depressed environment \u2013 assume January as full year commodity price debt, but in this environment, it\u2019s been pretty darn good.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Definitely sounds like it. And then, as we think about moving into the spring time, the gasoline crack typically would react a lot better.","Gene Edwards","","That\u2019s correct. You would have to assume \u2013 you would hope you could assume a higher average gasoline crack. As Lane said, it\u2019s nearly 80% distillate right now. The remainder is primarily gasoline or gasoline related components. So as that crack picks up, then you should see overall margins.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. The original calculations we looked at was more like two thirds, distilling one third kind of gasoline another. So the 80% reflects, again the comments about catalyst overtime, maybe we think two thirds or one third?","Gene Edwards","","Yeah, we\u2019ll see where it shapes out, because as Bill mentioned, the catalyst is highly selective right now which is advantageous, we\u2019ll where it shapes out, but I\u2019m not ready to change the base model for it.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Dahlman Rose","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I guess a lot of conversation has been around crude, I was a little more curious about product. In general, how have exports looked, is that kind of plateauing obviously there\u2019s been some pretty healthy inventory building in past month or so on the gasoline side. And I was just wondering if there is any trends that stand out to you on the export front, if it\u2019s decelerating or if you anticipate the same kind of growth that we\u2019ve had over the past two years?","Joe Gorder","Okay. Well, hey Sam, it\u2019s Joe. ","Sam Margolin \u2013 Dahlman Rose","Hey, how are you?","Joe Gorder","I\u2019m good. You?","Sam Margolin \u2013 Dahlman Rose"," ","I\u2019m good. Thanks. ","Joe Gorder","Good. Well, in the fourth quarter, we moved out almost 110,000 barrels a day of gasoline with primarily in Latin America and Mexico. And those are pretty high numbers, because typically we are doing 60,000 barrels to 70,000 barrels range. So demand was still very good. Latin America is growing and they continue to have supply issues. Mexico\u2019s demand is growing and they have some supply limitations. So from sustainability perspective, we still think that these export markets are going to be very good. ","In the first quarter of 2013, from a gasoline perspective, we will probably export less than we did in the fourth quarter and a lot of that has to do with the turnaround activity we got going on in Corpus Christi. If we talk about diesel, diesel inventories unlike gasoline inventories, diesel inventories are low. They are at the low end of the five year range and although U.S. demand for distillate continues to be weak, distillate demand abroad is strong and it continues to grow. In the U.S., I think we exported over 1 million barrels a day. ","Diesel fuel, that\u2019s up significantly from where it was last year. Valero exported 157,000 barrels a day of diesel fuel in the fourth quarter and we will increase that volume in the first quarter as we\u2019ve got the throughputs of the new hydrocracker. From our perspective, I think everybody else is always a market driven phenomenon and is the yard open or not and if the yard is open to move the barrels to South America or Europe, we will move them and if not we will keep them here at home. ","Sam Margolin \u2013 Dahlman Rose"," ","Okay, thank you. That data was really helpful. And then secondly, on the East Coast, I am sure you saw that was officially announced a plant that came up for sale. Historically, it hasn\u2019t been particularly competitive, but I was just wondering how you guys think of the East Coast as a derivative of your LLS thesis, barge activity might accelerate from the Gulf up to the North Atlanta and if you think that timing wise, it couldn\u2019t make sense to position into that theme a little early.","Bill Klesse","Well, as far as Valero\u2019s opinion on the East Coast, we exited the East Coast.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Dahlman Rose","Right.","Bill Klesse","And so I think as far as a refiner goes, we\u2019re still a supplier, marketer into those markets. So our action speak for themselves.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Dahlman Rose","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks so much. Have a good one.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Guys, good morning. Congratulations on the results.","Bill Klesse","","Thanks, Blake.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Have a question for you on the retail spend, presumably the $1.1 billion of cash coming to the parent company, I assume that\u2019s a result of the retail company taking on leverage. just trying to confirm, can you give us an idea of capital structure for the parent company post spin-off?","","Mike Ciskowski","Well, for the parent for Valero, I mean we\u2019ve just got $7 million worth of debt. We\u2019ll be receiving as we put into release $1.1 billion in cash from the separation. we\u2019ll have about $300 million of tax leakage associated with the separation. And then of course, we are retaining 20% of CST Brands and at some point in the future, I think within 18 months, we\u2019ll dispose.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","And Mike, to be clear that 18 months, should that be thought it was slow kind of bleed into the market or is that holded for 18 months and then all at once sell those shares.","Mike Ciskowski","","We have not determined how we will divest that. We\u2019ll be doing that in the next few months.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay, fair enough. The second question was on MLP. I know in the past, you\u2019ve talked about considering that after the retail spin, it sounds like you\u2019ve got a decent amount of capital investment going into the logistics and midstream side of things. Presumably it would make sense to move sooner rather than later just that you have some incremental revenue opportunity and sell that to the market. I\u2019m just curious if you have any thoughts on your appetite of moving forward with an MLP?","Bill Klesse","It has not changed at all. We have said that we will look at this seriously. We watch what\u2019s happening in the marketplace, and I\u2019m really talking about logistics and [turmoil] here. But really for our organization, the retail spin is occupying many of our people and we need to execute to get this done first. So I haven\u2019t changed what we\u2019re seeing on this subject at all.","","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay. Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citi. Please go ahead.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Good morning. It\u2019s Faisel from Citi.","Bill Klesse","Hey, Faisel.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Hey, wondering if you could go back to the crude oil import to the Gulf Coast, particularly the sweet crudes. You talked about how you backed out the foreign imports of sweet crude into the Gulf Coast I believe in the Memphis? In the fourth quarter, what was the impact of backing out those foreign crudes, and what kind of uplift did you get from consuming domestic sweets versus buying foreign born sweets in the fourth quarter?","Joe Gorder","In Memphis, I mean that was really where this happened right. Lane, you have a good idea on the\u2026","Lane Riggs","I\u2019m not sure, are we trying to dollar raises\u2026","Gene Edwards","Yeah, I think he is looking for so\u2026","Joe Gorder","I guess well, actually the numbers are \u2013 we were paying LLS plus $0.50 and now it\u2019s like LLS line of $0.50 \u2013 it\u2019s a ballpark of (inaudible).","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay. So\u2026","Joe Gorder","Okay. The landed cost versus and it depends on when and which because it\u2019s moving all over the place and we have been making this switch over the past year. ","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay.","Joe Gorder  "," ","I mean, we were working in foreign industry rivers, we used to bring foreign in the Houston, with foreign in the Memphis, so we have been back in those based on economics, but it could a dollar or a few dollars per barrel economics versus the landed cost of the foreign.","Bill Klesse "," ","We are also starting to see where we are reigning in some of the domestic suites into the Houston area and backing up, in terms of dollar, I think I have to check it, but that\u2019s of course, not just more on suite at this point, particularly in that Houston market, we are seeing where we may be displacing some of our crude assets. ","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc."," ","Right. I guess about looking at the sequential improvement in margin from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, I mean I get that the heavy crude discounts widened out, I get the more discounts widened out, but I am just trying to figure out, did you have purchases of Light Sweet crude, did they beat the benchmarks in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? Did you purchase them under the benchmark into the Gulf Coast, and Memphis in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, how was it relatively similar?","Joe Gorder "," ","I don\u2019t think there is any change relative to the purchase price of these crudes, and I think you got it right. I think it was heavy sour, medium sour change in the improvement in those discounts, and then the discounts on the residue that really drove the economics. ","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc."," ","Okay, got you. And was there any\u2026 ","Bill Klesse  "," ","However, we will be always acting our economics self interest on this. So we switch to a domestic crude, because it was more economic. ","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc."," ","Okay. And what about the impact of the big Permian discounts we saw in the fourth quarter, would you able to purchase those crudes at discount into the Gulf Coast or were they mostly trapped in that area.","Joe Gorder","They are mostly trapped. ","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay.","Joe Gorder ","Yeah, we do move Permian basin, Midland area crudes up to McKee and Ardmore but we've always done that.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay, okay. And last question from me. Where there any sort of derivative movements in the quarter, any gains or losses at non-cash directive gains or losses in the quarter?","Joe Gorder","No.","Bill Klesse","No.","Faisel Khan \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay, fair enough, thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Hey, congrats on the numbers, I wish I had the number out there, so you could beat it. Just on a follow-up to a question earlier. You spoke about Corpus trading at discounts to Houston, and then Bakken trading in St. James at a premium. Maybe I appreciate, it\u2019s a moving target, but if it's possible to be a bit specific about say what is the Eagle Ford discount into Corpus, what is the Permian discounts or the seaway blends down into Houston and what is the Bakken discount into St. James say relative in 4Q, say relative to LLS that would be helpful.","Joe Gorder","Okay. It's relative to LLS and if we keep it just as simple as we can and we have transportation right, okay. There are so many good reports out there now that are addressing this issue then we look at those to, but you've got a couple of dollars of transportation to get the Eagle Ford over to Houston. All right, and then you've got another couple of dollars to get from Houston over to St. James. So theoretically you could argue this Eagle Ford auto trade as an LLS minus $4 over in Corpus and LLS minus $2 in Houston.","And then if you look at it relative to WTI and you said what WTI is $3 or so $3.50 to the cost \u2013WTI is going to be, if you took it into the Houston markets, you\u2019re going to \u2013 you get it there for $3.5, so it would be a $1.5 over the Eagle Ford and to Houston, and as you took it all the over to St. James you\u2019re $3.50, and so this is the kind of the math we\u2019re working up, we\u2019re doing just kind of the same way, your guys are for saying, okay, what is it going to be if LLS. Bill mentioned it before that St. James will be the clearing point for LLS, and everything is going to trade and it move west to a discount, LLS, and then what next with (inaudible), while you\u2019re going to have it for rent ultimately into the east coast, near the LLS plus $4.50 to $5 a barrel, which is U.S. flag transportation cost to get it up here.","","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Yeah, so that makes a little sense and that\u2019s very helpful, thanks very much. And then I\u2019ve got a chart of LLS, Maya in front of me for what it\u2019s worth, I mean obviously there was a bump up in Q4, and clearly your earning have been benefited from that. Maybe just talk a little bit about market conditions as we come into Q1 in terms of particularly the surprise, but I guess we feel in terms of Mars and Maya benefiting your results more than expected.","","Joe Gorder","Well Maya discounts we\u2019re very good in the fourth quarter, a lot of that has to do with the weakness that we saw in WTS there, despite that discount a bit, and then also we mentioned that the residual fuel markets were weak and so that helped it all. So those residue is still weak today, the WTS discount has come in a bit so those margins have compressed a little bit, but Len and I were talking about it earlier today, I guess we\u2019re seeing medium sours pricing to the Gulf now, basically at a flat price to Light Sweet domestic crudes.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Right.","Joe Gorder","So anyway, we\u2019re still seeing decent discounts on these and you\u2019re seeing pressure on light sweet as more if it gets there.","Edward G. Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Kohler from Imperial. Please go ahead.","Ann Kohler \u2013 Imperial Capital","Great. Good morning gentlemen. Just a question certainly regarding some of the projects that you\u2019re working on, and how you\u2019re viewing the permitting issue and being able to move forward with some of those particularly when thinking about the Houston expansion?","Joe Gorder","","So we are very, I think you\u2019re alluding to the greenhouse gas permitting in?","Ann Kohler \u2013 Imperial Capital","Yes.","Joe Gorder","Our Houston and our Corpus Christi refinery due to some units that we have shutdown in the last few years, we\u2019re able to support a project that allows to be underneath the greenhouse gas permitting. The fiscal affect the industry I\u2019m sure everybody is looking at this in terms of investment, it may ultimately limit how big some of these investments can be, if they can make an decent investment, that keeps you below the greenhouse gas permit. So in both our crude expansion project at Corpus and at Houston are spud pretty much at that level.","Ann Kohler \u2013 Imperial Capital","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi guys.","Bill Klesse","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Congratulations to Joe on making President as well. If I could ask you, first about the export story, you\u2019ve talked about it, but could you just clarify, I think you said, you\u2019re exposing about 100,000 of gasoline. And I think it was 200 of distillate, is that at export capacity now?","Joe Gorder","No. I would say no. The gasoline, that was a good quarter, 100,000 barrels a day gasoline is a good quarter for gasoline exports but we have the ability probably fall and take out 225.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So I got the 225 number and then I think your 280 at diesel is\u2026","Joe Gorder","","Yeah. 280 is where we would say we\u2019re today and then we got logistics projects as we mentioned that improved docks and just really takeaway capacity. We expect to take us up to about 425,000 barrels a day of capacity.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And when \u2013 I think did you say the timeframe on that is 2Q?","Joe Gorder","No, no, we\u2019re working on projects right now, some of them will come on in the second quarter, but really I think these projects that we\u2019re taking about will have in place by the end of the year or early next year.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And\u2026","Bill Klesse","2Q was \u2013 we able to load crude out of Corpus Christi.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Got you. And then you\u2019ve mentioned this, there is an expansion of gasoline capacity above the 225?","Joe Gorder","Yeah. Some of these projects and really primarily the stuff we\u2019re doing in St. Charles and Port Arthur take us up to about 250.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then I know we\u2019re running out of time, so just the follow-up is, one of the issues that we\u2019ve seen with all these crude differential moves has been times right now heavy light spreads, but wee had a pretty good number in Q4. How is that dynamic working now this quarter and how do you expect that to play out? And I\u2019m thinking particularly one of the hardest things when we think about this is the fact that essentially a lot of that heavy crude is priced on a formula with a k factor. But we naturally expect that to be a narrower number going forward, because of how wide it got in Q4? Thanks.","Mike Ciskowski","As I mentioned its coming a bit Paul and a lot of it had to do with the fact that WTS was dislocated for a period there when there was some turnaround activity in midcontinent. So that and then the fact that residuals have been priced at a significant discount, both of those contributed to the mine discount. It has come in a bit and then the Mexicans have adjusted to K to try to get it back relating to market should we see us. I think we still have decent discounts that they have come in.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Right. And could you clarify where the Mexican think it should be?","Joe Gorder","Well, what do we say Bill, on discounts.","Bill Klesse","Well, into a sunk coker I have said to all of you that we need in this 10% range, so that we would have economics to go through the coker, but if you \u2013 to have good economics in the coker you need 15%, so but I\u2026","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I get it, Bill, that\u2019s what you say, that\u2019s it\u2019s kind of clear as long as I guess on the contractual side that\u2019s there for you two I hadn\u2019t heard you kind of \u2013 we haven\u2019t split that circle previously. And then the residual fuel aspects of the discount, I guess I\u2019ve heard you say in the past is it kind of a secular issue to do with lower demand for residue? Could you just \u2013 in the one minute specific on that \u2013 talk a little bit about how you see that playing out?","Joe Gorder","Well, China is not running residue anymore. They\u2019re running crude, okay. So that\u2019s back resilient in the marketplace and then with Libya production back on line, we just found ourselves in longer-supply that we have been in the past. So that would help.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And I think the demand side is weak as well right?","Joe Gorder","Yeah.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Great, thank you. Just one more question is light and heavy discussion. Are all your barrels, the heavy barrels in the Gulf Coast priced off Maya or the barrels from Venezuela and Colombia, does the price side kind done a different metric?","Joe Gorder","","They all look at Maya cheap, but they\u2019re not all priced off from Maya.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","So the (inaudible) barrels, do you expect the differential to stay wider on those barrels and what\u2019s happening with the formula based on Maya?","Joe Gorder","I would think so.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay, great. And then just in first quarter in general, we talked a little bit about this, but how is the environment looking for you now in the different regions, 1Q versus what you realize in the fourth quarter?","Joe Gorder","See, it\u2019s really kind of too soon to say, too soon to get any guidance for the first quarter, particularly in the margin. However we did say that the heavy differentials or discounts did narrow, so. ","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Right, okay. And then Bill, you mentioned a couple of times here on Keystone XL, do you have any thoughts on how this might go?","Bill Klesse ","I don\u2019t, you mean to the answer of what the administration is going to be?","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital"," ","Yeah, exactly, exactly. ","Bill Klesse "," ","My thought would be no better than yours. ","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. ","Bill Klesse "," ","However I think it\u2019s just ridiculous. There is pipelines everywhere, there is a pipeline in front of your home, have in the streets.

I just have a couple of quick ones and I want to queue up again. Can you talk about the cash burn in the quarter woven on there in terms of working capital just like, there is a big move there, and finally any comments on what you are hearing in terms of potential LIFO accounting changes on inventory and how that might effect you guys? I will leave it there, thanks. ","Joe Gorder","Okay. In the fourth quarter, we did have an increase in our receivables quite a bit, it\u2019s about $700,000 to $1 million, but that is really a timing issue as our cash received task picked up quite a bit here in January. And part of the differentials that are the reduction in cash as we had our federal or tax payment in the fourth quarter too a large one. So that was part of the reason cash going down.","Bill Klesse","I will note that this business is a taxpayer of nearly $500 million in the quarter.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks. ","Joe Gorder","And then you asked the question on LIFO.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, I\u2019m just curious about when you guys are hearing about potential changes and what would happen if we did see International Accounting Standards and employees across the U.S.?","Joe Gorder","Okay, so our LIFO reserve is\u2026. ","Bill Klesse","$6.7 billion.","Joe Gorder","","Is the value not on the books, $6.7 billion. We had $6.7 billion of value that is not represented on our books, so if they get away with LIFO and nothing change, we would owe tax on $6.7 million and again we would be a taxpayer.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, how much of that would be cash, and how much would be non-cash, can you quantify that?","Mike Ciskowski","The cash we pay 35%, I guess 35% of $6.7 billion.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Always that scary number guys, can you put some framework around how likely or what progress you think has been made to not issue on the \u2013 I leaver it at that?","Mike Ciskowski","Well, I'm going to say it's not going to happen. And obviously LIFO used in many, many industries, it's not unique to the oil business, but I don't say it would happen, and if it did happen, let's say it did, and we would obviously lobby for a payment schedule. But I mean obviously.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Bill Klesse","Okay, thanks, Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Kessler from Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.","Hi, guys, sorry for the double up, I think you want to wrap up the call. But since you opened Pandora\u2019s box, it\u2019s kind of Brent versus LLS and how you calculate that spread? You referenced to $4 to $5 cost of moving LLS up to the East Coast. I guess my question will be at the limited market and with the rate of growth in U.S. supply, you saturate that market in maybe a quarter or so worth of time. How do you price the spread post that event?","Bill Klesse","Okay. So you\u2019re saying what you\u2019ve got...","Joe Gorder","Maybe, I\u2019d just answer, that\u2019s way out in the future, but I will say to you that the marginal cost of transportation is going to be, why it\u2019s going to be the debt. So if Bakken lays into the East Coast at $15 to $17 by rail, and you can lay it into the U.S. Gulf Coast that $12 by rail, it\u2019s going to have an inherent differential there. I think that\u2019s why you saw one of our competitors lock up some transportation \u2013 water transportation from the Gulf coast up to the East Coast. So we would think then those differentials \u2013 when the markets are imbalance, we\u2019ll all equate close to the tariffs of the marginal source, water from the Gulf Coast to the East coast or rail from the Bakken or somewhere out there to the East Coast versus getting it all down to the Gulf coast.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.","Yeah. I guess, I\u2019ll get you on that, once you\u2019re imbalanced, but the moment you flipped to a net long position on the crude and you feel that all the coast. I guess, this is what I\u2019m trying to get to.","Bill Klesse","But then it\u2019s looking for a home.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.","Yeah.","Bill Klesse","And who can take it and it will drive. So if you can\u2019t export crude, then it\u2019s going to be pushing to another refinery, some other place. The other stand we\u2019ll keep doing is discounting and keep backing out some of these other types of crudes, exactly what Valero is looking at here at our Houston refinery where we are a feedstock buyer, we\u2019re looking at crudes units produce our own feedstock.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.","Yeah.","Bill Klesse","So you have projects like that, that we and I\u2019m sure others will look at the key to (inaudible) this up.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.","And I could be wrong, but let\u2019s just say, it comes quicker than that project comes online, you\u2019ve already sort of matched on it quite 530,000 barrels a day in your Gulf Coast system. You\u2019ve already got a scenario where some that you are light sweet and that your delivery is equal to your medium sour grades. Is there a scenario where you could force feed more into Gulf Coast system, while you wait on those projects?","Bill Klesse","It\u2019s not to a great extent. We would need the projects and it\u2019s because you would overload your light and handling capability.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.","Yeah.","Bill Klesse","However, we are very smart people and our people are happy and trying to figure out how to handle the light in. But the increment would be, if the delta gets wide enough, we\u2019re going to take it to Quebec.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.","Yeah. And so that one a pretty quick too I imagine.","Bill Klesse","Well, it\u2019s a 200 and some thousand barrel a day refinery, but yeah, we\u2019ll say it will be, because we like those numbers and they were also involved in line nine, so you will be feeding Quebec from a lot of different ways. And that will be another refinery that today is a \u2013 so it\u2019s Canada, but today we\u2019re on four and sweet for Canada, and instead of may grow in U.S. and Western Canadian.","Robert Kessler \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt, & Co.","Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Bill Klesse","Okay, thanks, Robert.","Operator","Now, with our last question I\u2019ll now turn it back to the speakers for any closing remarks.","Ashley M. Smith","Okay, thank you, Trish. And I just wanted to thank investors for listening to the call. If you have further questions, please contact Investor Relations. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.","And I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. John Locke. Sir, you may begin.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning. And welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you've not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, its says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We had solid safety and operational performance in the third quarter. Refinery utilization exceeded 99% and we set a new record for light sweet crude processing as discounts relative to Brent remained very attractive. We also delivered strong financial results outperforming the third quarter of last year despite a margin environment that was generally less favorable.","Our use of the Diamond Pipeline and Enbridge Line 9B again contributed meaningfully to the performance of our Memphis and Quebec City Refineries, as these pipelines provided access to discounted Cushing and Canadian sweet crudes respectively. We look forward to the startup of the Sunrise Pipeline expansion, which is scheduled for November 1. This pipeline will add another 100,000 barrels per day of Permian pricing exposure to our Mid-Continent refineries and displays an equal volume of less competitively priced crude.","We continued to deliver on our commitments to grow Valero's earnings capability through growth investments and acquisitions, while delivering returns to stockholders. The Diamond Green Diesel expansion was completed in August, bringing the current renewable diesel production capacity to 16,500 barrels per day. Development continues on a project to add a parallel facility and further expand the production capacity to a total of 44,000 barrels per day. A final investment decision is expected before year end.","In September, our board of directors approved a project to construct a 55,000 barrel per day coker and a sulfur recovery unit at the Port Arthur refinery for a total cost of $975 million. Upon completion in 2022, the refinery will have two parallel crude vacuum coker trains. The additional coker capacity is expected to improve turnaround efficiency and provide margin benefits from increased heavy solid crude processing capability and reduce intermediate feedstock purchases.","Earlier this month, we agreed to acquire three ethanol plants from Green Plains with a total nameplate capacity of 280 million gallons per year at a cost of $300 million, plus working capital estimated at $28 million. These plants utilize ICM and Delta-T technologies that are located in the corn belt, enabling us to transfer best practices from our existing portfolio and capture commercial and operational synergies. We expect to fund this acquisition with cash and anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and possible FTC review.","Construction of the Central Texas pipelines and terminals and the Pasadena products terminal remains on track and work continues to progress on the Houston and St. Charles alkylation units and the Pembroke cogeneration plant. These projects are scheduled for completion in 2019 and 2020.","Moving to Valero Energy Partners, we announced last week the execution of a definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common units of VLP at a price of $42.25 per unit. The transaction is expected to close as soon as possible after meeting customary closing conditions. Given the paradigm shift underway in MLP markets, Valero evaluated a range of options before the partnership and Valero concluded that a merger would provide the best outcome for Valero shareholders and VLP unit holders.","This transaction offers compelling benefits for Valero shareholders in terms of cash flow synergies in a simplified structure. At the same time, the merger addresses MLP investor sentiment that has shifted away from favoring the high distribution growth, an equity funded drop-down model to a model that favors slower distribution growth and self-funded organic growth. The merger also offers a premium to VLP's average trading prices and immediate conversion of VLP's equity to cash.","Now, turning to cash returns to stockholders. We paid out 55% of our year-to-date adjusted net cash provided by operating activities and we continue to target an annual payout ratio of between 40% to 50% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities.","As we look forward to the fourth quarter and into 2019, we remain optimistic. Global economic activity continues to grow at a reasonable pace. In the U.S., unemployment rates are at record lows. Domestic and international product demand is strong. Gasoline export volumes are expected to increase seasonally, while distillate export should moderate as winter demand picks up in the northern hemisphere. Despite margins incentivizing maximum distillate production at relatively high industry utilization, days of supply for distillate remain near five-year lows.","And with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Thank you, Joe. For the third quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $856 million, or $2.01 per share, compared to $841 million or $1.91 per share in the third quarter of 2017.","Operating income for the refining segment in the third quarter of 2018 was $1.3 billion compared to $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2017. The $90 million decrease is mainly attributed to lower gasoline and secondary products margins, partially offset by wider discounts for sour and sweet crude oils versus Brent.","Refining throughput volumes in the third quarter of 2018 averaged 3.1 million barrels per day and throughput capacity utilization was 99%. Throughput volumes were 207,000 barrels per day higher than the third quarter of 2017 when the operations of five of our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries were impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.67 per barrel were $0.08 per barrel lower than third quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher throughput in the third quarter of 2018.","The ethanol segment generated $21 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $82 million in the third quarter of 2017. The decrease of $61 million was mainly due to lower ethanol prices in the third quarter of 2018. Operating income for the VLP segment in the third quarter of 2018 was $90 million compared to $69 million in the third quarter of 2017. The increase of $21 million was mostly attributed to contributions from the Port Arthur terminal assets and Parkway Pipeline which were acquired by VLP in November of 2017. For the third quarter of 2018, general and administrative expenses were $209 million and net interest expense was $111 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $517 million and the effective tax rate was 24%.","With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $9.1 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $3.6 billion, of which $128 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion of cash was 24%. At the end of September, we had $5.3 billion of available liquidity excluding cash of which $750 million was available for only VLP. We generated $496 million of cash from operating activities in the third quarter. Included in this amount is $729 million use of cash to fund working capital. Excluding working capital, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.2 billion.","Moving to capital investments, which excludes acquisitions, we made $604 million of growth and sustaining investments in the third quarter. Sustaining investments of $435 million include $171 million of turnaround and catalyst costs. The balance of capital invested in the quarter was for growth.","With regard to financing activities, we returned $775 million to our stockholders in the third quarter. $341 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 3.8 million shares of Valero common stock. As of September 30, we had approximately $2.8 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to expect 2018 capital investments to total $2.7 billion with about $1.7 billion allocated to sustaining the business and $1 billion to growth. Included in this total are turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments.","For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.76 million to 1.81 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 265,000 to 285,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 480,000 to 500,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $3.80 per barrel. Excluding the acquisition of the three ethanol plants from Green Plains, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4.1 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter.","Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For 2018, we expect the annual effective tax rate to be about 23%. For the fourth quarter, we expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $220 million, net interest expense is estimated at $110 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $525 million. Lastly, given recent declines in ethanol and biodiesel RIN costs, we are reducing expected RIN's expense for the year to between $450 million and $550 million.","That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that our callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, and nice quarter as usual.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Joe, if we could, one thing you didn't talk about in the overview, but is certainly very topical here, the IMO 2020 thought process. So, story comes out, administration doesn't like it, no surprise there. But the IMOs meeting this week. Can you talk about maybe what we're seeing, and what your expectations are, how that fits together? And if there is any change in how you're looking at the potential impact about this time next year into early 2020?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hello Roger, good question. We'll let Jason speak a little bit about that.","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. Hey, Roger, this is Jason. I'm sure many of you all have been following that meeting you just referenced. The Marine Environmental Protection Committee's meeting is going on all week in London. And I'm sure you all have experienced the same as we have, it's a closed meeting, so information trickles out in drips and drabs at different times, but this is what we've gleaned from it, from what we've been able to ascertain.","Looks like there's been two very positive developments come out of the committee so far. Looks like the carriage ban will go into effect on its original proposed date of March 1, 2020. There was a proposal I believe by Bangladesh to delay it, that was defeated. And it will be officially voted on either today or tomorrow, to lock it in. So, we think that's a very big deal since it gives the port states a powerful tool to help them force the new specs. You don't have to prove the ship burn non-compliant fuel, they just have to look and see \u2013 just having it in the fuel tank on board is a breach of the regulation but unless the ship has a scrubber. That's going to help a lot with maintaining compliance.","The second bit of good news relate to this experience building phase proposal that's caused quite a bit of commotion and that's what was referred to in that Wall Street Journal article. Now, exactly how this proposal would work was never really clear to us. The proponents themselves actually took the step of issuing a clarifying statement, saying it wouldn't delay or phase into spec change. Nevertheless, there was a lot of worry that this might be a path at least of potential delay or watering down of the standards.","So, there was a lot of debate on it at the meeting and the report we got yesterday was that the committee reached an agreement at the end of the day that the proposal will be limited to data collection and analysis and cover nothing else. So, there'd be nothing about a phase-in or initially relaxed enforcement. So our main take away so far is that the committee seems to remain firm in its commitment to fully implement the spec change on January 1, 2020, and then make sure the right enforcement tools are available.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Second unrelated question, you've got two acquisitions coming at you this quarter, the ethanol and the VLP deal. How should we think about the 40% to 50% payout of cash flow in terms of dividends and share repos relative to the commitments in this particular period with the acquisitions or do we think about the acquisitions as a balance sheet event and the CFFO is the normal process?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Roger, that's another good question. And we've been very consistent in our messaging, in our execution around our capital allocation framework. And really what we're talking about here is the discretionary uses. There is no consideration of affecting our maintenance CapEx, or turnarounds or the dividend in a negative way.","So, this really is focused on the discretionary uses and if you look at what we've done, we've got really good growth projects. The Diamond Pipeline is performing very well. We've got the coker project, which has significant returns, it's under development. We got the (17:19) Central Texas pipeline and many more really good growth projects that are underway.","If you look at it from an acquisition perspective, which is another component of the discretionary piece, we got the ethanol plants which Martin can talk about here in a bit, but we were able to buy ethanol plants in a down market. And when we're looking at acquisitions, that's always what we're trying to do. And then on the repurchases, we've got the payout ratio which is overriding, but we've been very ratable in our acquisition of our shares and we're focused on buying this. So, what I would say here is that you should expect that our behavior to remain consistent going forward with what we've done in the past.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Awesome. Thanks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay, buddy.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Paul.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I have to apologize that first question is somewhat similar to what Roger just asked on the IMO, but I want to focus that, Jason, you guys have a lot of contact in DC and in the White House and all. Yeah, I know Joe then met with President Trump for a number of times. Can you give us some insight that what exactly the White House trying to do? Or what is the proposal they have in mind in terms of slow down, the rollout? I mean, what kind of mechanism or what kind of program that they have in place or what that they are thinking?","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. Sure. And I don't think they've come to a conclusion yet. And one thing we shouldn't do is read too much into this one story with an anonymous source from the administration as being a statement of their policy. From our discussions, we don't think the administration has reached or formed conclusions yet.","They all understand the economic impact of the potential changes, but there is nothing yet. Now the word was, they were supporting that experienced building phase and in that context or it seemed to be that it would lead to some type of delay or lax enforcement upfront, but looks like that was very clearly shut down within the committee. Importantly, we were told the U.S. delegation actually supported this conclusion of basically morphing that proposal into something that only dealt with data-gathering. So I think it's an ongoing discussion. They don't have a firm commitment yet or firm position yet and they're just trying to understand the situation.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Jason, just curious that in the conversations you have with the White House staff, does any occasion come out as a nuclear option saying that U.S. could even drop out from the ECA destination. Can the President have the authority that just use executive order to get out if he want to?","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","It is pretty complicated. I don't think they're having discussions a lot about that yet, anything that extreme. And we've tried to understand this is very complicated, this international kind of treaty law. And I can tell you what we've been able to glean, although we're definitely not experts on it. It sounds like he could pull out or the U.S. could pull out of the entire treaty, the MARPOL treaty or the entire Annex. He doesn't have the option to just pull out of the IMO 2020 sulfur regulation.","And that would take 12 months notice and there is no certainty around whether the Senate would have to approve that or go along with it. But the point is, if he pulled out of the entirety of Annex VI, which is the narrowest thing you could deal with, that covers all of the international marine, air pollution requirements. So, the ramifications would go way beyond the IMO sulfur, the 2020 regulations. So, it wouldn't be taken lightly by the administration and it would have ramifications way beyond that spec. So, I think it would take a lot of thinking and see if they want to do that.","Even if you did pull out of the treaty, the other complication is a lot of the requirements and regulations or provisions of the treaty have been incorporated into separate federal statutes. So, even if the President withdrew from the treaty, the statutes can't be changed except by an act of Congress. So they would still be in place. So, it's a very long and messy process to go down that road.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. And my second question that maybe is for either Gary or Lane. Maya, seems like it's being \u2013 it's priced very expensive, do you find that is attractive for you to run it now? Or that you can have other alternative you would be able to find this far more attractive, are you running it at all? And then maybe as a final, after the roll in of the VLP, will the reporting format of the companies be changed that you just roll everything into refining and no longer report VLP or logistic result on a separate item? Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Paul.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Paul, thank you. Maya question, certainly the volatility between Brent and WTI in the Midland Cushing spread along with fuel getting strengthened has wreaked havoc on the Maya formula and so we would certainly say that Maya is not priced competitively in the market today. We had several conversations with PMI. I think they are well aware that their barrels are not been priced competitively into the U.S. Gulf Coast and they will make adjustments as we move forward.","I also think that Maya is not really as relevant of a marker for heavy sour crude as it used to be. Certainly in our system, the only heavy sour barrels that we buy that are priced off the Maya formula are the barrels that we get from Mexico. The remainder of the barrels are not priced off of Maya. Today, Canadian heavy barrel and the U.S. Gulf Coast has $8 to $10 advantage over Maya. So, we still see a good incentive to push heavy sour crudes into our refining systems but I would agree, Maya is not priced competitively today.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","And then I guess the next question was, Paul your fourth, was relative to...","Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.","The segment reporting question. Yeah. So we assume a process of evaluating the segment reporting going forward once VLP is no longer publicly listed. We don't have anything to share with you at this moment but that is something that we're looking at.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay, buddy.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning, everybody.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","I wanted to get your views on market fundamentals and specifically, while distillate demand and inventories appear pretty positive, the converse seems to be true for gasoline, although net exports for both seem to be pointed in the right direction. So, my question regards really demand trends in the domestic and the regional market that you guys are involved in for these two products. And also whether you sense that price has allocated demand somewhat in North America and Latin America in recent months, whether we are seeing some demand destruction of any sort. So, just kind of an overview on gasoline and distillate please?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Sure. This is Gary. I think, basically demand is kind of where we'd expected it to be going into this year. You've had a little bit of demand growth compared to last year, about 1%. The real surprise, especially on the gasoline side is just very high refinery utilization, so. And year-to-date, we've averaged 93% refinery utilization, 2.6% higher than where we were last year. With that increase in refinery utilization, gasoline production is up about 2% over where it was last year. And even though you've had an increase in demand you've had about 2 to 1 increase in production over demand, and it's caused a surplus in the inventory build.","As we move into the fourth quarter, I think you've seen gasoline cracks get very weak. Some of that is typically as you move out of driving season, you see weaker demand for gasoline. And then you also have the potential to even slow the gasoline production further as you move out into RVP transition and get butane into the pool.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Yeah.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","I think, there are a few bullish signs in the gasoline market, inventory has actually grown in the last couple of weeks and a lot of that is due to what you alluded to, we've seen very good gasoline exports. In the last three weeks in a row, we've averaged about 1 million barrels a day of gasoline being exported. In our system, we're seeing very strong South American demand. Of course, in South America they're moving in. So, there's summer driving season, which has been supportive of the gasoline crack.","And when you look at gasoline inventory on a days of supply basis and you take those exports into account, we are about the five-year average range on a parent days of supply.","On the supply side, it looks like we could be getting some help as well. In the last set of hydro data I've looked at, it looks like Northwest Europe hydroskimming margins have turned negative.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Yeah.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Conversion \u2013 even conversion refinery economics are about breakeven. In the U.S., we're seeing very tight margins on reformers and cat crackers.","And even in the U.S., the hydroskimming refinery, if you don't have an advantage crude supply those economics are getting challenged as well. So I think you'll see some gasoline come off the market. In fact, in the last week of BOE stats, you did see gasoline drop fairly significantly. Gasoline yield drop fairly significantly. And then I think, you're starting to see some indications of some run cuts in the industry as well, the Brent curve move from backwardation to Contango, it's may be an indication that you're getting some run cuts that are starting to pressure down the front part of that Brent curve.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay. Can you spend just a second on distillate as well?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. So distillate I think if you look at where distillate inventories look both on an absolute basis and certainly on a days of supply basis, we're very low.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Yeah.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","We really just haven't been able to replenish distillate inventories since the hurricane last year. We continue to see very good export demand for distillate as well as domestic demand. And certainly in the Atlantic Basin as you're moving into heating oil season, we would expect demand to be very strong for distillate.","Then again on the distillate side, I think, if you do get some hydroskimming refineries and some refinery run cuts that will even be more supportive of the distillate market as well, because you'll take some of the distillate production offline as well.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Sure. Thanks a lot guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Joe, I'm sorry my first one is an IMO question as well. So I wonder if I could take advantage of Jason being on the line. Jason, the situation as it relates to I think Paul's question earlier about the White House and so on. Our understanding is that it's really the enforcement is really done to member states. Do you have any thoughts on what the signaling from the U.S. whether they pulled out or not, does it really come down to the penalties or the enforcement mechanism which could ultimately be eased if \u2013 as one method of a kind of work around. I'm just trying to think about how the rule making evolves over the next 12 months? And any thoughts you might have on that would be appreciated?","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. No, you're right. That's the key component and historically the U.S. has been one of the most zealous enforcers of MARPOL through the Coast Guard and the EPA.","And think about how shipping works and like I said all shipping within the U.S. is already covered by the tighter sulfur spec, which we seem to be fine with the 0.1% in the ECA. The only other shipping that's involved is stuff going to and from the U.S., and if the U.S. didn't want to enforce it especially now that we have the Carriage rule in place, the flag state would have authorities to enforce it and wherever that ships, the other end of the voyage, right, where it's coming to and from, that port state would also be able to enforce it, and has the Carriage rule to help it. So, you'd say even if the U.S. chose not to enforce, which would be very uncharacteristic of us, there should still be a lot of mechanisms in place to do it.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. A lot of moving parts, we'll see how it plays out. But I guess, my second question is also kind of related, if I may, and it really gets to the Doug Terreson's question about the gasoline market. It's maybe one for Gary, but whoever wants to chime in, our understanding is that there's a broad consensus, Europe \u2013 let's face it, this is the best thing to happen to European refineries in 20 years. There was an expectation utilization is going to go up at the same time as a lot of U.S. light sweet crude is going to make its way to European markets at the end of next year.","How do you see that impacting the Atlantic Basin gasoline market and related to IMO, if I may, is it a kind of an offset, which is to swing the cat feed into the bunker fuel market, there is a viable solution to perhaps resolving some of the potential tightness in the distillate side? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think the way you characterize it is very similar to the way we see it. I think, it looks like for the next several months, certainly fourth quarter through first quarter gasoline market is going to remain weak. And certainly as European refiners run more the U.S. light sweet crude, you have the potential to put more gasoline on the market. And it's really when you start getting into the fourth quarter and people start to reacting to change for IMO and you pull some of the VGOs out of the cat to get them into the bunker market, the gasoline balances start to tighten back up along with some demand growth.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So does that cap the upside risk on potential diesel margin spike as it relates to IMO demand?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","I don't really know that it spikes. No, I don't really know that I understand what you're asking, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So the perception is that diesel margin spike on the back of swing from away from high sulfur fuel oil into marine diesel. But if we're cutting back cat feed on weak gasoline markets, doesn't that solve part of the problem?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. I think, most of the forecast that we think says that that will happen, but it will help make up for the shortfall in the marine bunker and the high sulfur fuel being pulled out of the market. Combination of that with ULSD going to the marine market as well.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. A lot of moving parts. Thanks, fellows, appreciate the answers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks, guys. I was wondering, if you could share some thoughts around your CapEx plans next year. Now with the logistics business rolled up and the coker spend particularly on the growth side, and how that looks between your business segments? And if you may longer term just any thoughts around that allocation split? How that will evolve with the new business structure?","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Hey, Benny, this is John. We really don't have our capital guidance out there yet for 2019. If you look at what we've done here in the last couple of years, it's been sort of in this 50\/50 allocation logistics and refining. I mean we've gotten projects set out there obviously, that's part of the bigger strategic plan, but we only have guidance on this year.","Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey guys, sorry. I don't have an IMO question. My question is more on the very strong performance on the North Atlantic side. I just wanted to understand was it both the assets equally contributing? Or was it (33:31) capturing the European cracks really well, or was it also the Qu\u00e9bec city benefiting from the light-light spread? Any color you can provide on the very strong results on the North Atlantic region?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Hey, Manav, this is Lane. So really what you saw in our North Atlantic strong crack attainment was our exposure to this wide Brent TIR and really it's our line 9 reversal that we invested in. We only had access to sort of the distressed Canadian crudes coming out of that region of the world. So that was really what drove us not only to have exposure to the price of those crudes, but also to run a little bit more rate as a result of that.","Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And one follow-up sir. E15 was recently announced by President Trump and there were some concerns that it might eat up into a small portion of the gasoline demand, but I know you guys have very strong views that it's not going to be as material as people think. There are lot of challenges to E15, so if you could give some color on that also please?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Sure. I'll let Jason talk to you a minute about that.","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. You're right. Back in October 11, the White House announced they were going to direct the EPA to start a rule making to get the E15 RVP waiver in place for next summer. And this is something ethanol guys have been fighting for a long time. It's been at the top of their list.","We don't think it's going to be a sudden big increase in ethanol penetration. But first of all, there are lots of reasons E15 hadn't taken off already. Not just \u2013 it's not just related to this RVP waiver. Retailers have concerns about equipment compatibility. There's risk to engines that aren't warranted for the fuel, who's liable for it if you have an issue. Questions about consumer demand.","But \u2013 and there's only about 1% of the stations in the U.S. have E15 now about 1,400 stations. And when you figure out what will it take to offer E15, there's varying questions, basically you have to spend some money, and you have to spend a lot of money or little money kind of depending on the configuration of your station. But there's going to have to be some capital spend.","And that brings us to the legality of this rule. Now, there is a big debate about whether the EPA has the authority to grant this RVP waiver for E15, like some people think they do and then a lot of people also think that it's going to have to be done by Congress because the RVP waiver for E10 is actually included in the RFS statute itself.","So, one thing is certain is whenever the EPA rule goes final, there's going to be a bunch of people suing, a lot of lawsuits challenging EPA's authority to do this. And this is going to take a couple of years for that to work its way through the courts before you get a final answer.","So, now put yourself into shoes of one of these retailers who's got to spend money to able to offer E15. Now, you're going to spend money with the risk of having stranded capital because in a couple years, the court may void it. So, I think that's going to be \u2013 have some type of a chilling effect on the capital rollout, which will keep things \u2013 keep the rollout from being very aggressive, along with just the general problems with E15 we've talked about a lot.","Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you guys. This was very insightful. Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","You bet.","Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just wanted to circle back on the pad on the Atlantic Basin. Part of that \u2013 I appreciate the color on what the strength there was. I wanted to just sort of drill down on the product side. You're able to get your distillate yield up, gasoline volumes down, obviously optimizing through the dynamics there, but just wanted to get an understanding if there's anything on the product pricing side or moves you have been able to do in that market that they're also helping to realize margin there? And then how to think about that on a go-forward basis versus broader regional dynamics?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Lane again. I think, the only other comment I would make is that our Qu\u00e9bec refinery, the way we have that refinery configured, it makes a \u2013 have a very high distillate yield for the kind of crude that it runs. The only time you get into a market where the gasoline crack is depressed in relation to the heat crack that refinery will perform very, very well. And as we all know, I mean, the heat crack has sort of being outperforming the gas crack here of late. So when you think about that as a base going forward, that's really one of the big drivers for that performance in that area is Qu\u00e9bec's distillate yields.","Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And I guess my follow-up also not an IMO question, but wanted to ask is how the Western Canadian heavy and short, near-term and then maybe looking to 2019 plans, just to getting more WCS down into the Gulf Coast if it was Lake Charles. I was \u2013 we've been hearing a lot about rail and incremental transport volumes. So I just wanted to see if you have any color there or an update on what we can expect. I'm thinking about this also longer-term with respect to the Port Arthur coker decision?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. This is Gary. I think, in the short term, really you're going to depend on rail to clear the production in Western Canada. And I think you'll continue to see that market constrain. We're certainly ramping up our rail volume some. We did about 30,000 barrels a day in the third quarter. We expect to get that up to 40,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter.","And then it looks like there's some additional rail being dedicated to that market early next year. But I think before you see a meaningful shift in the Western Canadian differentials, you're going to have to have one of the pipeline projects done. And it looks like, the first opportunity for that would be the Line 3 Replacement Enbridge project, which looks like the earliest that would happen would be late next year.","Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much gentlemen.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Joe, I was wondering if you could just spend a minute walking through the rationale for buying in VLP versus potentially doing something with the IDRs or other options that are available to you. And then additionally, you mentioned in your prepared comments that there will be some cash flow synergies and so I was wondering if you could give some sort of quantification of that?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. You bet. I'll take the first part and I'll let Donna take the second part. But if you go back to the original plan with VLP, we've used the MLP structure and its lower cost to capital to develop projects that supported Valero's core business. And whenever we did a project at VLP or at Valero for subsequent drop to VLP, it was always with a, does it benefit Valero and help integration into supply chain going forward. So that was where we started. Okay.","We got it out there. We have this great base of logistics assets that we could drop down and opportunities enable us to provide the MLP investor with a clear line of sight to ratable growth. We had a sub 3% yield on VLP's equity and we were executing as promised. Then the MLP markets appetite changed significantly from a drop-down driven high-growth sponsored MLP equity to a self-funded low growth model with corporate and governance rights. And the cost of capital was also higher than that at VLO. So we looked at this for a year or more. We're very patient. We watched carefully for any catalyst change that would support a shift back to our original design and we saw none. So we looked at every available option.","We agreed that the best outcome for both Valero Energy and the VLP owners was the buy-in. VLP unitholders get a premium to the average trading in the market and VLO stockholders get an accretive transaction. So it was a win-win, which are very hard to find and it's dealt with a problem we've got or that we had, which was that we had an entity out there that we needed to retain control over and we weren't able to grow it. So, Donna, do you to take the second piece?","Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes. In regard to the other option that we've...","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah.","Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.","\u2013 we've looked at so a lot of talks in the market had been about eliminating the IDRs, you know, unfortunately that doesn't solve the underlying issue of being able to fund growth because you still wouldn't have access to the equity market. Some other options that we've seen MLP's chose are converting to C corps. As Joe mentioned these assets are key to us, and maintaining control over them is absolutely key to support a lot of our primary refineries and we didn't want to put the MLP into a structure that jeopardize Valero maintaining control over those assets.","So we looked at a lot of different options as Joe indicated. We took our time doing so. We have spent the last year also looking at all of this \u2013 all of the options at whether or not we really thought the MLP equity market would recover at anytime soon and we kept coming back to buying in was the best solution for both the unitholders and the shareholders of Valero.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","You know, Brad, it's interesting in that every solution that one might consider is unique to their individual circumstances. And somebody else might choose to do it differently. VLP was small enough and it afforded us this opportunity. If it was huge, we probably wouldn't have had the opportunity to do something like this or we would've had to do it differently. So anyway we think we made the right decision and the timing was such that we were able to execute it now we decided to go ahead and do it.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then any quantification of the synergy benefit?","Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.","They're coming from a lot of different places. Obviously the leakage fund \u2013 unitholder \u2013 public unitholder distribution is a large piece of that. The public company cost is another piece of that. And just the simplified structure cuts a lot of administrative costs out of the equation.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Appreciate the thorough answer.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Low with Redburn. Your line is now open.","Peter Low - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one is just on the \u2013 hi, the first one is just from the ethanol acquisition. Can you give us a more color on the strategic rationale behind that? And perhaps whether you'd look to do more deals in the biofuel space in the future?","And the second was just a quick one. In the release, you talk about a $700 million working capital build. Is that simply the impact of rising oil prices? So should we expect it to unwind in future quarters? Thanks.","Martin Parrish - Valero Energy Corp.","Sure. On the ethanol, this is Martin. We take a long-term view at this. And if you step back and look at ethanol, it's going to be in the gasoline pool for a long time, right, and it's a core part of our strategy. So the opportunity came up to buy three quality plants. So we took it. We see corn ethanol as the most competitive octane source in the world. We expect ethanol demand to grow globally. If you look at exports, they are up about 30% year-on-year for the last three years. Exports will be 10% of production this year and you also see domestic production has been growing at about 3.6% a year, this year that growth is going to slow to something 1%, 1.5%, so that big increase in production is slowing down. So we think things are going to start improving on the supply demand balance and with that we will get some margin improvements. So it was just, we're always looking at acquisitions, our last one was in 2014 for ethanol and it just became an opportunity to us, but looked good and we took it.","On the future, we will continue to look in this space and then the other thing we're obviously looking at in the biofuels is what Joe mentioned, a decision on the Diamond Green Diesel too, that will be coming up before the end of the year and that's it.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","And then Peter you were asking about working capital?","Peter Low - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","That's right.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","What was your question again, sorry, just repeat it?","Peter Low - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","It was, there's is quite a big build in the quarter, about $700 million. I was just wondering, was that simply an effect of rising oil prices, so should we expect that kind of unwinds over the next few quarters?","Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.","That was a combination of some volume and some price impact and there should be a fair portion of that that will reverse itself.","Peter Low - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","That's great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning team. First question I had was around Port Arthur and the decision around sanctioning the coker project. Can you talk a little bit about the economics of it? How should we think about it either on an IRR basis or incremental EBITDA for the capital that you're spending there?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi Neil, this is Lane. So, really the benefits are twofold. One is the feedstock flexibility, there was an earlier caller that asked the question around our view of Canadian heavy sour in the Gulf Coast, and we certainly had a longer term view there was going to be considerable amount of heavy sour in the Gulf Coast and in addition to that just our overall sort of how that fits into our optimization of our Gulf Coast. We'd like to benefit from the feedstock flexibility.","And secondly, it's turnaround efficiencies. This is a two \u2013 today, this is almost a two train refiner with the exception of a big coker. So anytime we're taking certain units offline to do turnarounds, there is a lot of synergies and having this additional to essentially finally separate this refinery into two separate trains and build and execute turnarounds in a more efficient manner.","With respect to EBITDA, I'd characterize that we think the EBITDA is around $325 million using mid-cycle prices and I am going to preface it by saying that mid-cycle doesn't include IMO. So we've always been \u2013 we've been pretty vocal saying this is not really an IMO project. This is very much about optimizing our system. Obviously, if our outlook is to make $325 million in our mid-cycle case, then it's got a lot of upside in an IMO 2020 universe.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I appreciate that Lane. And the follow-up is just on the Brent\/WTI differentials. There is two parts to this question. One is, how do you see that evolving over the next six months to a year with the spread obviously at a very wide level and arguably beyond transportation economics, but then again with the potential for Cushing to build in the intermediate term? And then the second is that you guys have done a good job of whether it's through the Sunrise Pipeline or through the Diamond Pipeline actually getting access to those light barrels. So, can you just talk about how you are evolving the system to capture those inland discounts?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Hey Neil, this is Gary. I think we see with the start up of the Sunrise Pipeline and then production increasing around Cushing, you will have more barrels beginning to make their way to the Cushing hub. Certainly, as PADD 2 turnarounds wind down, you'll get some demand back, but most forecast I see shows that Cushing continues to build through next year and I think you really have to get to the point of late next year when some of the large Midland Permian to the Gulf Coast projects come on that allow Permian production to clear to the Gulf and some of the barrels that are currently going to Cushing get pulled away before you see Cushing start to draw again. Yes, and back to our system, Sunrise and Diamond and then Line 9 have all increased our access to certainly the Midland and Cushing barrels, which has been a significant uplift for us.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks team.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Hi, good morning everyone. For the IMO, to make it simple for the IMO question, what's your current assumption for the number of barrels a day that are going to be affected here when we get to 2020? I just wanted to sort of simplify the whole question?","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, I don't know that we have an absolute number that we give. There is roughly 3.5 million barrels a day of Marine Bunker being consumed and our view is a majority of that has to switch to the 0.5 spec.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Yes. And essentially although you said the coker project is not IMO related, I guess you're expecting essentially the IMO change to go through at considerable scale basically?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Hey Paul, this is Lane. We do believe IMO will go ahead. I think that's our view. But we didn't fund or we didn't do this project because of IMO 2020. We see a lot of upside. We see a lot of upside on that.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Right. So, is it then based on a heavy light spread assumption, can you talk a little bit about the midcycle that you referenced as being the rationale for the investment? And I have one follow-up which was just, given the VLP takeback, could you keep going and actually buy MLPs now? Is that a thought? Thanks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","I'd say Midcycle is just the way we define it. Midcycle is sort of the average \u2013 the last average of the last 10 years sort of pricing scenario, so we're trying to capture a full-blown refining cycle absent sort of what we consider to be major dislocations primarily I would say in the domestic crude market, for example, when we had the Brent\/WTI blow out a few years ago out to 30, we throw that out and what we consider to be a midcycle. So that's how we price it.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Sure.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","All right, Paul. Paul, you got a follow-up for Lane or...","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","No, I was going to ask about this idea that maybe you keep going and buying some MLPs?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, I mean, we've always had that opportunity quite honestly, right. We could have done it in VLO and then subsequently drop the assets to VLP. We'll continue to look at them. But here again I think our general view of the space is that we need logistics assets that provide better access for crude and feedstocks into the refinery and more access to markets with products moving out. And to the extent that there is an opportunity out there that scratches those, one of those two itches or both, I think we will really look hard at it. Otherwise, I don't think that \u2013 it's certainly not what I would say a specific point of focus where we're looking at and saying, gee whiz, we need to go now and roll up MLPs.","Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC","Understood. Thank you, Joe.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","You bet. Take care, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi Craig.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Could you all walk through the timelines for the buildout of contracted and acquired assets in Mexico and Peru? Maybe elaborate on the potential export implications both on volume and margin? And Joe relating to your last comment, could you opine on the opportunity for additional Latin American infrastructure opportunities post the Peru investment?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","As far as timeline...","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","As far as timeline, we acquired the terminal, it's operational. There is a second terminal...","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","That's Peru.","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","That's Peru, I'm sorry. And there is a second terminal in the northern part of Peru that we are in the process of reactivating and that should be first quarter of next year. So we'll have over 1 million barrels of receipt facility in Peru. And in Mexico, the Veracruz terminal, which is about 2.1 million barrels of storage should be in service the end of this year, early first quarter of 2020 and then the inland terminals which combine between Puebla and Mexico City should be the end of 2020 (sic) [2019], first quarter of 2021 (sic) [2020].","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. So that's that. And then Craig, we do continue to look for opportunities to put a stake in the ground internationally. Gary, do you or Rich have any other comments on that? Okay. No?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","No.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. So we'll continue to look \u2013 I think really part of my focus right now and the team's focus is, okay, we've got the terminal in Peru and we bought an entire business. So Gary is running \u2013 not only we got the terminaling operation, but we've got a marketing business that was associated with that.","And it takes a while to get your arms around things and to be sure that we're maximizing the value of it. So we're looking at that as a potential stake in the ground to allow us to do more on the western coastline of South America. And then I think we'll look for opportunities to continue to try to move to the eastern coastline down the road, but no specific plans right now.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Hi, good morning. Just a couple of clarifying questions or follow-ups. First one would be, obviously between the ethanol plants and the growth opportunities in VLP, you've had a string of announcements recently. I think one of the questions that's been out there is just can you \u2013 with the organic pieces of this can you fund this all within the construct of your existing capital budget framework? And I know you don't want to give specific 2019 guidance, I guess yet, but just trying to clarify that key point? And then Joe just generally, I mean do you feel like there are other opportunities out there that you're looking at? Or you just happen to have a string of things that just kind of came up recently?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well. So, we're not deviating from the capital allocation framework. And yes, to answer your question even though we haven't provided guidance for 2019. I think we generally provided ranges that we thought were with our capital ranges and we're not deviating from that. So that's not going to change. I would say that the timing of these opportunities \u2013 acquisitions are always opportunistic. And so Martin and his team did a good thorough evaluation with Rich's team on the ethanol plants and we had a willing seller. And so we had an opportunity to buy at numbers that were very attractive relative to deals we've looked at over the last couple of years.","The VLP buy-in, it was just timely for us to do that. Again, we were patient. I mean it could have happened in June, right, but we wanted to wait and see if the market changed. When we finally concluded that we had a basically a broken equity out there and this VLP wasn't going to do for VLO what we expected it to do, it's time to move on and get out of it. And that's exactly what we did. So it is more coincidental that these things happened at the same time and certainly a sign of things to come.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Just a second question is just on the throughput guidance for the fourth quarter. Yeah, I think you're assuming at the midpoint may be 96%, 97% type utilizations. I guess, I'm just a little surprised by that because of the commentary around some parts of the world needing to do run cuts. So I guess, obviously, Valero is a low cost refiner. So perhaps it's less impactful for you guys. So I was just wondering how you think about your throughput guidance in the context of the pretty weak gasoline cracks that are out there right now?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","So, Phil, this is Lane. I think when you think about throughput, it's primarily feedstock and crude, right. So at this time, we think our assets are pretty competitive and so our outlook is not that unchanged minus whatever turnaround activity we have in a particular region. Gary's comments earlier around where margins are, are predominantly we see a weak North Western Europe hydroskimming margins and Mediterranean hydroskimming margins. And then we are starting to see sort of breakeven economics on conversion units in the entire Atlantic Basin. So we'll just see how that affects our \u2013 in reality, what our throughput is, but at the time we gave this guidance that was kind of how we saw the universe for the next three months.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for all the added color guys. Two quick follow-ups if I could. Obviously there's been some questions on capital allocation. I realize you're not deviating from your historical approach and also, we're not in a position to provide 2019 CapEx guidance. But just curious how views around leverage are influenced by the recent developments, it seems like obviously organic investments, acquisitions provide some opportunity for capital deployment. The share price has obviously pulled back and you've talked about opportunistic buys historically. So can you just remind us or revisit views around sort of consolidated leverage?","Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. So our target for leverage is between 28% to 30% and we're at the lower \u2013 at 24% to the lower half of that. We have a large cash balance today to fund a lot of the things that we're talking about as well as some borrowing capability.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So, no change in that, feel comfortable with it. Okay.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","No.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Also following up on the E15 question, appreciate the market views. They're really helpful. But I'm just curious how a potential approval of the President's proposal might impact your own ethanol operations if at all. And then also any views around additional ethanol acquisitions. I think Joe in your prepared remarks you had noted federal review of the Green Plains plant acquisition as a condition. So I'm just wondering if there's any market concentration issues at any point that you think you might run into.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay.","Martin Parrish - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, this is Martin. I would say on the E15, it really doesn't impact our ethanol production thought process any, go along with what Jason said on that. It's going to be slow and very measured penetration into the market here in the United States. So it really doesn't impact how we're looking at things. As far as future acquisitions, we keep looking at them. I mean the largest producers are still only 11%, 12% of the market space in the United States. So it's probably not an issue.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for the added color, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Jason Gabelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hey guys. How's it going? If I could ask two quick ones. Firstly, just on cash from ops. It looks like in addition to the working capital drag there was an additional $200 million of cash drag that was unexplained in the press release. I was wondering if you could provide any commentary around that?","And then secondly just on gasoline demand growth. I know you referenced 1% growth kind of year-to-date, but it seems like that growth has been moderating a bit over the past couple of months. Are you seeing a similar trend? Thanks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","You want to take the second one first?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Hey, Jason. Yeah, let's take the second one first.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Gasoline.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. Yeah, so on gasoline demand, I'd tell you that the only real visibility we had to that is through our wholesale channel. Quarter-over-quarter our volumes were up 5%. So our wholesale volumes grew at better than the demand growth. We did see slight reduction in volume from the second quarter to third quarter only about 1%, but we really attributed to that. It looked like most of where we lost demand was in the Southeast and was storm related.","Jason Gabelman - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it.","Donna M.

Good morning, everyone. Coming back to Prashant's question on WCS, you mentioned that we should expect a small near-term increase in rail volumes. I was wondering have you made any pipeline commitments on the future pipes, like L3R, KXL, or the transbound expansion?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, this is Gary. No, we don't have any pipeline commitments, but we do have some arrangements with producers where we would buy barrels in the Gulf when those pipelines are done.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then on the West Coast, we saw a pretty expensive ANS barrels in Q3 and then I think today, we're back to a premium versus Brent. Any color on what's going on with ANS?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think that the West Coast market was actually the most impacted by some of the volume slowdown from the Middle East. Some of the Saudi barrels and Kuwaiti barrels that went out to the West Coast kind of took pressure off the ANS. So, as we see the Saudi volumes ramp back up and more of those barrels making their way to the West Coast, I think it takes some of the pressure off of the ANS.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","And I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke, Vice President, Investor Relations.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release.

There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that we completed another quarter where we ran our refineries very well at high rates, and also delivered good financial results. Our low cash operating cost and highly reliable operations, combined with our advantage footprint focused on the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Mid-Continent, enabled us to achieve positive earnings and free cash flow generation, despite the choppy margin environment. As always, our team's primary focus is on safety and reliability, and we continue to deliver distinctive operating performance, but remain committed to improvement. As such, we're extending our participation in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program to more of our facilities.","Moving on to the refined products markets, we're pleased to see a rebound in distillate demand, in addition to the strong gasoline pull by domestic and export customers. Downward trends and product inventories and structural shortages in the primary export markets for the U.S. Gulf Coast provide an encouraging backdrop as we move into the second half of the year. On the crude supply side, we're seeing the impact of the OPEC cuts on the medium and heavy sour discounts, but increased U.S. drilling activity and crude production have supported attractive domestic sweet crude discounts relative to Brent in the second quarter. As a result, we switched our refining system to a maximum light crude slate in June. With current market conditions, operating a system with flexibility to process a broad range of feedstocks is very beneficial.","Turning to capital allocation, we continued to execute very well on our capital program during the quarter. The Diamond Pipeline and Wilmington cogeneration plant are both on track for completion this year. Construction is continuing as planned on the Diamond Green Diesel expansion and the Houston alkylation unit, and we're looking forward to seeing the additional earnings contribution from all of these projects once they're complete.","We continued demonstrating our commitment to stockholders by returning $658 million through dividends and stock buybacks in the second quarter. At this pace, we believe we're well positioned to exceed our payout target for the year.","Lastly, on the topic of public policy, we get a lot of questions seeking our perspective on the many initiatives being worked on by the Trump administration. While it's difficult for us to speculate on the range or probability of potential outcomes, we're pleased with the emphasis that President Trump and his administration have placed on the energy sector, and their willingness to discuss the issues.","So, with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Thank you, Joe. For the second quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $548 million, or $1.23 per share, compared to $814 million or $1.73 per share, in the second quarter of 2016.","Second quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $503 million, or $1.07 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany our release.","Operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of 2017 was $959 million, compared to $1.3 billion for the second quarter of 2016, which has been revised, retrospectively, to reflect the VLP segment. Second quarter 2017 operating income was in line with second quarter 2016 adjusted operating income of $902 million.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 3 million barrels per day, which was 192,000 barrels per day higher than the second quarter of 2016. Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the second quarter of 2017, despite an external power failure at the Benicia Refinery that caused an abrupt shut down and unplanned maintenance.","Refining cash operating expenses of $3.51 per barrel were $0.10 per barrel higher than the second quarter of 2016, mainly due to higher energy costs in the second quarter of 2017. The ethanol segment generated $31 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $69 million in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2016 was $49 million. The decrease from the 2016 adjusted amount was primarily due to higher energy costs and strong industry ethanol production.","Operating income for the VLP segment in the second quarter of 2017 was $71 million compared to $52 million in the second quarter of 2016, mainly due to contributions from the Meraux and Three Rivers terminals, and the Red River pipeline, which were acquired subsequent to the second quarter of last year.","For the second quarter of 2017, G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $178 million, and net interest expense was $119 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $499 million, and the effective tax rate was 26% in the second quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate was lower than expected mainly due to the favorable resolution of an income tax audit.","With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $8.5 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.2 billion, of which $88 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 24%. At the end of June, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which, $720 million was available only for VLP.","We generated $1.8 billion of cash from operating activities in the second quarter. Excluding a working capital benefit of about $700 million, net cash generated was $1.1 billion.","With regard to investing activities, we made $461 million of growth and sustaining capital investments, of which, $63 million was for turnarounds and catalysts.","Moving to financing activities, we returned $658 million in cash to our stockholders in the second quarter, which included $312 million in dividend payments, and $346 million for the purchase of 5.4 million shares of Valero common stock. As of June 30, we had approximately $1.9 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. Capital investments for 2017 remain on track for $2.7 billion of total spend. This amount, which includes turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments, consists of approximately $1.6 billion for sustaining and $1.1 billion for growth.","For modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.65 million barrel per day to 1.7 million barrels per day, U.S. Mid-Continent at 445,000 barrels per day to 465,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 280,000 barrels per day to 300,000 barrels per day, and North Atlantic at 440,000 barrels per day to 460,000 barrels per day.","We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $3.80 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization.","We expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, for the third quarter to be around $190 million, and net interest expense should be around $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $500 million.","That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This helps us ensure all callers have time to ask their questions. If you have more than two, please rejoin the queue as time permits.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Phil Gresh, with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Morning, Phil.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question, just on the quarter itself, in terms of the situation at Benicia. I know there's been some press about this. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on it a little bit. What would you quantify as lost opportunity cost from it? It sounds like you're back, up and running, but just if you could clarify that as well.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Phil, this is Mike. We did \u2013 yeah, we are back, up and running. The opportunity is about \u2013 it's over $100 million in this loss. Using $100 million can give you some perspective; that would equate to about $0.16 per share. So, our second quarter earnings should have been around in that $1.40 range.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And we're back up and running at this point?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes, we are.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes, we are.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, okay. Okay, second question is just on the capital spending. It feels a lot like last year, where you're trending well below the $2.7 billion number and kind of run rating closer to about $2.2 billion. So, is there anything big, specifically in the second half, we should be thinking about from a turnaround standpoint, growth capital standpoint, that would lead to a big pickup?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","I mean, our guidance right now is still $2.7 billion. We are trending a little bit below that. We have the completion out of the few of the projects that Joe talked about in his comments. So, we'll be reviewing this as we go throughout the balance of the year, and see if we need to give any updated guidance.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Cheng, with Barclays.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Two questions that maybe I don't know whether it's Gary or whether Lane is here. In your refining system, you've been doing phenomenally well for the last several years. Utilization rate is up, and more reliable. So, why not that realistically should we assume that this is as good on a sustainable run rate that you may be able to achieve or you actually think that the sky is the limit, and you will continue to be able to push it upward?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Paul, this is Lane. I'll take a stab at it. We obviously, always focus on reliability. Even though we know we outperform our peer group in this space, there's always room for improvement. We have a whole portfolio of 14 refineries. Some are absolutely excellent in the area of reliability and some not so much. And so, we can continue to work on those and get better. But, that's really what we're focused on is trying to be reliable. And through reliability, we think it's the path to lower operating costs, because we minimize the one-time event. So, there's still upside with respect to our reliability over the long haul. I mean, I think the area that we continue to really focus on is improving our turnaround duration. That's really the sort of the last \u2013 our cost structure is great. We just want to get \u2013 that's the area that we think we can work on. So, essentially, try to do these \u2013 expanded to raise the interval between turnarounds and execute on time and certainly be a very predictable on that.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And if you could quantify, say is it going to be another 1%, 2%? Any kind of range that you can help?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","I'd have to get back with you on that, Paul. I don't know that we can \u2013 I don't know that we have estimated a range for that. The measure we use internally for our reliability is a Solomon indicator for mechanical availability, and I would say it's probably on the order of 0.5% to 1% probably improvement is still in front of us.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. The second question is for Joe. Joe, it's a little bit of the curveball. The last month or so, we have heard the number of countries in Europe, such as in UK and France, talking about, by 2040, they would stop the sale or ban the sale of the gasoline and diesel car. Just curious that in the board that when you guys are looking at that, is that a threat the board actually spend a lot of time at all? Or that you think say another 20 years to 30 years out is just way too premature to really thinking too much on that?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Paul, last year, at our strategic planning session, we met with the board and talked about the long-term viability of fossil fuels. So, the products that we produce. And every analyst that we read believes that, and people are doing 20-year outlooks, they all stated that we were going to see continued demand for gasoline and diesel fuel into the extended future.","This news, I believe that you're talking about, I guess, we saw it a couple of days ago, yesterday or day before, on the EU moving away from fossil fuel vehicles by 2040. And it's not a surprise that things like that get proposed. But it's so far out on the horizon and so many things change that it's not something that we would change our strategy today to try to deal with.","Jason, is there anything that you'd add to that?","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","I'd just add \u2013 kind of echo what you said. Specific to the UK announcement, it seems like they're really focusing on improving their air quality, specifically fighting nitrogen dioxide emissions. And 2040 is a way out. I mean, it's hard to say what pollution control or other technologies could evolve during that time, which may lead to different policy actually being implemented by the time you get to 2040.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","So, Paul, just to summarize, I think it's not an issue that we believe is material enough right now that it's something that we need to alter strategy or visit with the board extensively about.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Spiro Dounis, with UBS.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to start off with Mexico. I believe, we've seen some headlines suggesting that maybe they already made or are in the process of getting permits there, expanding into Mexico and the wholesale market. Just wondering if you could provide anything on that front.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I can, this is Gary. We are looking to build upon our current supply relationship with Mexico, as opportunities for product demand growth appear to be there. We believe our refineries are well positioned to allow us to be the cost advantage supplier into Mexico. We are in the final stages of securing a major supply arrangement in Mexico, but we have certain confidentiality obligations that prohibit us really from talking about it at this time.","We're working on some pretty exciting things, and we'll be able to share our Mexico strategy with you in the near future.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Totally understand. I appreciate that color. And second, Joe, you mentioned the RFS, and the fact that you're encouraged just purely by the fact that the administration is willing to listen. I guess, I'm just wondering for sort of gauging our optimism on some sort of relief, is that really the only thing to be excited about, is that they're actually listening? Or do you feel like real relief is something we should expect maybe November or sometime next year?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Boy, that's really a great question. Why not let Jason take a crack at this, and then we'll see if there's anything to add.","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","Sure, yeah, this is Jason again. One thing that happened recently were the proposed RBOs were released by the EPA, and they were generally what we were expecting. We're pleased to see the reductions in the cellulosic and advanced targets, which seem to be more in line with the volumes that are actually being produced. Regarding the RIN prices, the RBO really didn't change our outlook for what we foresee on the horizon.","On the volume side, we still have a 15 billion gallon conventional ethanol target, which has the industry butting up against the blend wall. And the blend wall is a real challenge in light of vehicle warranty, equipment compatibility and other issues. One positive note was, EPA did mention in the proposed RBO that they would be looking at possibly using their reset in the future, which is encouraging. That's a tool they have at their disposal. We also still have this broken structure with a disconnect between the point of obligation and the point of compliance. There're still very long parties and very short parties, and we think this is contributing to the high RIN prices, which are costing consumers billions of dollars a year.","We are still hopeful the EPA is going to address the point of obligation. Our petition is still outstanding and the docket is still open. And these high RIN prices really aren't benefiting corn farmers or ethanol producers. It's just the RIN-long parties. They're not leading to more ethanol blending because the parties who control the blending are benefiting from the high RIN prices. So they just have no incentive to push to the blend wall. So, we're hoping this is a situation we can get addressed.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","We have been continuing to work this very actively, and really the administration has been very receptive to conversations around this. They are trying to do what's right and to fix broken processes. And so, we remain hopeful that point of obligation is dealt with properly, and we also are hopeful that the EPA uses its authority to adjust the RBOs to be sure that the blend wall doesn't become a chronic problem going forward.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Really appreciate the comprehensive answer. Thanks, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Heffern, with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, everyone.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Morning, Brad.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Morning, Joe. You or Gary, I'm just wondering your thoughts on if we see sanctions on Venezuela, what the impact on Valero's crude sourcing could be. Do you think that there will be difficulty securing heavy volumes? Or is it only going to be a price effect, if there is a price effect? Any color there would be great.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Brad, this is Gary. We've had a longstanding, very good relationship with PDVSA and they've been a good crude supplier to our system. The way we view any potential sanctions is, it really just creates some inefficiencies in the crude market. So, the natural trade flow for a lot of Venezuelan production should be to the U.S. Gulf Coast. If sanctions were imposed, those barrels will continue to flow. They'll just flow to other markets, and then we'll have to buy barrels away from other markets to supply our system, which will cause the cost of the heavy crude to go up some. It's really impossible for me to speculate how much the cost impact that would be.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Joe, I feel like we kind of have this conversation every quarter. But you guys continue to come in far above the payout target, and I think that you've come in above it ever since you've had the payout target. So, is that just an artifact of being in a lower crude spread environment right now that the earnings are depressed, but the cash flows aren't? Or is there a time in the future when we could see that target move higher?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, I mean, that's a good question, too. We are producing significant amounts of free cash flow, and we've been consistent in using the capital allocation framework that we've got in place to help guide our use of cash. The one thing that we've shared is that we don't have an intention to continue to build huge stockpiles of cash, because Mike's got the balance sheet in a place where with our low debt to cap, if we wanted to do something we could do it.","So, I think you should anticipate that we're going to continue to execute similarly to what we've done in the last several quarters. We always evaluate share repurchase versus dividends, and we would like to be in a position to continue to increase the dividend going forward. But to the extent that we have free cash, we're going to use it.","Mike, anything you'd add to that?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","In addition to the payout target, we do look at, I mean, obviously, our operating and financial results, our cash flow, our cash position, and then competing uses of that cash. So, the target is just one thing that we look at. And Joe said, our plan is not to hoard the cash, but we're going to continue to invest in our business, and then also buy back shares, if that's the best alternative.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Appreciate the answers, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Brad.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Sankey, with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone. This is kind of maybe not a follow-up, but maybe should have been a prequel to the previous question, Joe, which is about where you think we are in the cycle. Because, the way I see it, oil has settled around $50 per barrel, and looks like that kind of down the strip. Your earnings have been fairly stable. We've mentioned that you've been doing a great job of paying out cash.","I guess one exception might be the OPEC cuts and whether that changes things. And the other thing I wanted to sort of address, and this is a bit convoluted, but also how you see seasonality now. And then, to be specific, to start you off, you said you maximized out your light crude consumption. Could you just specify or remind us what that number is?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","You bet, Paul, and I'll let Gary take a crack at this.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay, to start with, on the light processing capability, we now say we can run about 1.6 million barrels a day of light sweet crude. In the second quarter, we were a little below 1.4 million barrels a day, so about 88% of our capacity was utilized in the second quarter. The third quarter, we'll see that trend up a little bit more. Some of it has been, some of the domestic medium sours have still been economic to run, and that's why we're not completely at 100% of our capacity in the system.","On the discussions on margins, we tend to look at a mid-cycle case. And our view is that where current margins are, they're below mid-cycle. The gasoline cracks are good, slightly above mid-cycle. But the diesel cracks have been fairly significantly below our mid-cycle case. As we move forward, our view is that the diesel cracks continue to improve, as global demand growth causes those balances to tighten. And then, certainly, when you look out further, the IMO bunker spec change, in our mind, has a significant impact on diesel consumption and will cause cracks to be fairly strong as you approach 2020.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, how do you define mid-cycle then?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","So, everyone does that differently. We have a period that is from 2009 through 2015 that we use. That average over that period is what we call our mid-cycle.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, that's understood. And so, I guess you're a bit below. Would you be anticipating, therefore, higher oil prices? I mean, crude prices going forward.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes, we think crude prices will go up. I think that the efficiency gains in the upstream kind of caps how high they need to go, but we certainly see where crude prices will go up some from where they are today.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks. And, Joe, if I could \u2013 again, speaking of people saying we seem to ask this every quarter, but if I could just roll back, you seem to be talking about cash in and cash out is how you're looking at the company. But you've got this net income target. Could you just square the circle one more time for me on the payout potentially of net income against the company, which seems to be more planned on cash in, cash out? Thanks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Paul, I think we said, we look at both, right? We use the 75% of net income as the target, just because it's such a transparent metric. But when Mike and John are looking at our repurchase strategy, and really the use of cash in general, in setting that target, he looks at multiple metrics, right.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","I mean, if you look at it on a cash flow basis, excluding the favorable working capital that we had this quarter, the payout is at 60% of our cash flow. That was for the second quarter.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, it's been great for you guys. I mean, if you look at the multiple, assuming that you're below mid-cycle it makes sense, but you've nevertheless seen quite a material expansion in your multiple, I think, as a result of your strategies. So, congrats, I guess. Thanks, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","And our next question comes from Neil Mehta, with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Neil.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, you guys have a unique perspective on what's happening from a global oil demand perspective given how far your barrels travel. Obviously, there was concerns about demand earlier this year, with the IEA reporting demand sub 1 million barrels a day in the first quarter. Second quarter looked very, very good. I just wanted to get your perspective, over the last couple months and then also looking forward, where do you see oil demand tracking? And, geographically, where do you see pockets of strength?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Neil, this is Gary. We continue to see domestic demand as strong, and then a real pull into the export markets. As the U.S. Gulf Coast basis is stronger during driving season, you don't see that so much on gasoline. Although, we still saw a pretty good pull of gasoline into Mexico and South America. Then, on the diesel side, we saw very high diesel demand into the export markets. We exported 281,000 barrels a day of diesel during the quarter, which was a record for us, and we're really not seeing that fall off much as you move forward.","So, this time of year is typically where diesel demand bottoms out, seasonally, and so the fact that we've been able to continue to pull diesel inventories down, at a period where demand is at its lowest, kind of sets up what could be a very good heating oil season this year.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great, guys. Then, the follow-up question is just on RINs here. I think your guidance is $750 million to $850 million. Given where the D6 RIN has moved, and even frankly, the D4 as well, is it fair to say that you're going to be on the upper end of that range?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think that's fair to say, Neil. Unfortunately.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Yeah. All right, guys, thanks. Thanks again.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","You bet.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","And our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Hey, guys, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","I realize we didn't get tax guidance for next quarter, but I was hoping you could maybe just give us an update on the status of this income tax audit. I guess I'm just a little worried if this finally rolls off or comes off, we're going to have like a rapid reversal in the taxable income.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, the tax rate, we've had some favorable adjustments the last couple of quarters that has lowered that tax rate. But, why don't I try to give you guidance for the year. So, for 2017, we do expect our effective tax rate to be about 28%.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay, so, on a full year, 28%.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, let's try that.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","That works.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Blake, you were listening, you missed the tax guidance.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","We had a bet on that, whether anybody would notice.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","I thought maybe John just skipped it, so.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","But we've been so accurate.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","The second question I had for you is kind of a follow-on to Paul's question on the light sweet. So, it sounds like you're kind of at 88% of your capacity in 2Q, and that's trending up in 3Q. I guess, is the view that that will continue ramping up as lower 48 volumes ramp up? And I presume, once we've exhausted the system, assuming Valero is kind of a proxy for the industry, presumably we'll have more exports. Are you planning to kind of participate in that? Or is that an opportunity for you?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Blake. So, I guess the way I would say, certainly in the near future, we expect to be maximizing light sweet, and it's somewhat tied to U.S. production. But, to me, the real change would probably be more tied to when the OPEC barrels come back online. As the OPEC production comes back online, the differentials widen back out and we start pushing some mediums and heavies back into our system.","In terms of your question on the exports, our primary focus is putting the most economic crude dye in front of each of our refineries. So, our exports have really been focused on getting barrels to Pembroke, in Quebec. As exports continue to grow, we could decide if we want to venture into selling to third parties. But right now, our focus has just been getting it into our own system.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it. All right, thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Leggate, with Bank of America.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Morning, Joe. Morning, everybody.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Joe, I want to hit on this light crudes question as well, if I may. I hate to beat a dead horse. But I'm just kind of curious, from a macro standpoint, what has triggered this change recently. It might seem pretty obvious. But Saudis and OPEC's comments about cutting exports to the U.S., directionally, is that the thing that has prompted you to do this? I'm just curious what the catalyst was, given the OPEC theoretically cut at the beginning of the year. As a quick follow on to that, hopefully John doesn't count this as my second question, when you're running light sweet crude, what does that do to your operating costs, given you're not running the upgraders? I guess, less than you'd normally be.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","All right, I'll answer the first part, and then Lane answers the operating cost portion. Really what we saw is, when the OPEC cuts were announced, you really didn't see much of a market response to that announcement. So, the medium sour differentials and the heavy sour differentials remained wide enough that that was the economic barrel to put in front of our system. Had the cuts have gone on longer, longer, the medium sour differentials have come in and the heavy sour differentials have come in such that the most economic barrel to put in front of our refineries is the domestic light sweet. And so, that's what we've done. And the change there kind of started occurring in the second quarter. And even in the second quarter, you saw the domestic medium sour still economic. But now, if you look at the MARS versus MEH type spread, or TI in Houston; it strongly favors running domestic light sweet. And so that's where we're headed, and I think we'll be there until the OPEC production comes back.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, Doug, this is Lane. In terms of the incremental operating cost or light versus medium or heavy, I think at a reportable level, it's not very measurable. I mean, I don't think you would see a change in our operating costs, based on our crude mix.","Where it would show up, if we run more or less barrels. And so, to the extent that, at some of our refineries when we go light, like at Port Arthur, we actually run more barrel, because our coker fills up later. So, on an OpEx basis, you might actually see our OpEx go down. But, it's a little bit by refinery by refinery whether it would show up. I sort of believe you wouldn't see it in aggregate. We wouldn't \u2013 it wouldn't be a reconciling item for us.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's helpful. I've actually assumed it would be an incremental positive, given your coker comment. But \u2013 so, my follow up and, John might note, sort of for the record, my second question. But my follow-up, I guess with a bigger, a larger light slate, you're going to see a larger gasoline cut coming out of that. And I want to wrap a couple things together here with the dynamics of U.S. demand. Your project queue, as it relates to somewhat limited growth capital with your discipline and so on, I'm just wondering where the whole export strategy fits for products in Valero's strategy going forward. In other words, is that something we could see you swing to a more aggressive investment to basically avoid RINs and maximize your gasoline margin and all the rest of that? I'm just kind of curious how that fits. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, so I guess the first question on whether running the lighter diet increases our gasoline make, I would say it's not significantly different as we go lighter. A lot of our gasoline production capacity is maxed out. And so when we go lighter, we end up exporting naphtha. And then, on the export strategy, we want complete flexibility to take our finished product to the highest netback market. And so that's certainly been our strategy, and we'll continue along that path. And if that's selling domestically, that's great. But if we can get a higher netback putting the barrels on the water, then we want the flexibility to be able to do that.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","And Doug, just on the capital piece of this. So, we are working projects aggressively that facilitate our ability to be very efficient in the export of products. And it's just, unfortunately, a little bit premature for us to give you any insight into that. But I think that you should expect there to be more communications on this over the next several weeks, as we firm up some of the things that we're working on.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's terrific, Joe. Maybe we can do it on beer and a sausage and you can tell me about it over that.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","You're on. I would look forward to it.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks a lot. Take care. Bye.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thank you. Bye.","Operator","And we have our next question from Chi Chow with Tudor Pickering, Holt.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you. I might have missed this, but could you provide the product export volumes by product in 2Q? And related to that, can you talk about the dynamic on the slack capacity on the Colonial Pipeline? And is that related to the exports? And how will that trend going forward in the back half of the year here?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Hey, Chi, this is Gary. So, on gasoline, we did 88,000 barrels a day during the second quarter. Most, all of that went to Mexico and South America. Diesel, we did 281,000 barrels a day. And then, if you combine the kerosene, it was 326,000 barrels a day. That went about 75% to South America, 25% to Europe. And so, then, on your question on Colonial, we've seen the economics of shipping on Colonial have been challenged for quite some time now, and it really is tied to the exports. So, historically, what you saw happen is, as U.S. Gulf Coast started to become long on product, the bases got weak, and you had an arb to ship up to New York Harbor on Colonial. What's happening today is that the length in the Gulf has been pulled to the export market, and it kind of keeps the U.S. Gulf Coast basis a lot stronger, such that there isn't an economic incentive to ship on Colonial.","The other factor that comes into play here is the Jones Act freight. And so with Jones Act freight coming off, you can put finished product on a Jones Act vessel and bring it around to the harbor, and it's within a penny of what it costs to move it on Colonial. So, that also has been a factor that's come into Colonial coming off allocation.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Gary, I guess what you were saying back to the netback question. You are getting a higher netback on exports then is that what's implied versus shipping on Colonial?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes, that's right.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay, thanks. Second question is more a strategic in nature. Yes, Joe, regarding the company's long-term investment strategy, many of your Gulf Coast competitors and I'm pointing to specifically Exxon and Motiva, have announced absolutely huge capital programs, $18 billion to $20 billion predominantly to integrate downstream into petchems. Do these announcements influence your thinking at all, from a competitive standpoint, on the long-term strategy of sticking to refining, primarily in the Gulf Coast?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, I mean, Chi, it's a good question. And it doesn't change our strategy. We've talked in the past about a petrochemical strategy, and it's it really not as dramatic or as significant as you might be thinking. Currently, we produce a number of petrochemical streams. Products like propylene and BTX. And the strategy that we're talking about here is really to capture more of the margin available from those petrochemical stream where it makes economic sense to do so. The investments associated would be related to any additional processing, and then logistics to store and transport these products. We have no plans to deviate from our capital allocation framework, and decisions to allocate capital to these projects will be based on the expected project returns within our notional capital budget.","So, although these guys are investing in these major petchem projects, that's really not our plan or our focus. And we do continue to have a focus on improving our refinery operations. We have a focus on integrating from the wellhead into the refineries, and from the refineries out, so that the margin that's captured in the movement of products and crude is something that we capture rather than paying to somebody else. And so, I don't think that you should worry that you're going to wake up one day and we're going to be announcing that we're investing in a mega billion dollar petchem complex. It's just not on the radar screen for us.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Are any of these incremental petchem projects in the CapEx budget at this point?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","They're still in development, and we've got placeholders for them.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","So, again, I don't think you should expect that we're going to deviate materially from this 2.5 to 2.7 number, going forward.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks, Joe. Appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Justin Jenkins with Raymond James.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess maybe a couple on midstream from me. So, obviously, there's a lot of competition there and some pretty high asset valuations. And, Joe, I know you've said in the past that recent transactions have looked a bit aggressive, and really I appreciate the answer to Blake's question on light sweet. But really would the interlink with the refining footprint in VLP and maybe the synergies there be enough to justify a higher multiple for building or buying assets?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think if you're going to buy assets, you're going to have to be prepared to pay a higher multiple. I mean, that's just where the market seems to be today. And, so, building them has really been where we've had a great deal of focus. I mean, we're looking at assets that are in the market for sale today, but we always compare it to the alternative uses for cash. Relative to exports, Rich, you want to give any update?","Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. Relative to the exports on the crude side, we're looking at a couple projects at Corpus and at Port Arthur to increase the ability to export crude. We've got, as Joe mentioned earlier, we've got some projects that are in the development that we'll be able to share more in the coming weeks, but that will significantly increase the ability to increase product exports. So, we're focused on getting that flexibility for Valero.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, but, Justin, we really like the idea of the organic growth projects, where we have a great deal of control over the investment profile and the project execution.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, great. I appreciate that response, guys. And maybe \u2013 not sure how far I'm going to get with this one, but with the contested terminal acquisition in California, anything you can share there, in terms of what you expect, and in terms of how that plays out, and what it would mean to have in Valero's hands going forward?","Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. This is Rich again. So, we really can't provide anymore additional details than what's kind of been in the press release, other than the FTC allowed the transaction to go through, and the Cal AG has intervened. And that's kind of where it's at right now.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Figured that was the case, but had to try. Thanks, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, Faisel.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just a couple questions. First of all, just on the working capital, the $700 million benefit. What caused that? Because I guess some of the companies that are reporting are seeing working capital draws.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, in our instance, a little over $400 million of that was due to reduction in inventories. And then we had about a $250 million increase in the crude expenses. So, some of that's going to be timing, obviously, where we will be paying off those expenses.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, got you. And then just on the projects that you guys have in development, but not in execution. I guess this potential, I guess, $1 billion in EBITDA, when do you have to start to go to FID on these projects? Because, you've already got some projects in execution that are in 2019, and you're talking about a potentially large number as you go into 2021. So, at what point do you have to start making decisions on some of these projects, whether it's octane enhancement or the supply chain into Mexico?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Faisel, the way, and Lane can talk in more detail about this, but the way that we work our projects, we look at the target for the year. And we've got a fairly dynamic approach to doing this, where Lane's engineering staff will work the projects, and then we review them periodically to see which ones we want to continue to proceed forward and to invest capital in. And so, it's not like we look at everything in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter. We're looking at them throughout the year. Any color you want to add to that?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","The only thing I would add is, we do have a strategic view. We invest in projects that we think increase our ability to meet what we consider to be higher octane requirements in the future. We like the idea of small, sort of quick-hitting projects that give us more feedstock flexibility, because we think we're particularly good at that. And, obviously, we \u2013 we have a strategic view to capture more of or pay ourselves for our own secondary costs, and there's a lot of projects in this. We just have made the decision to be careful about communicating more around the timeframe of where we do have an FID decision versus just sort of \u2013 we're trying to say, conceptually, this is how we view the world. Trust us that we have plenty of projects that fit into that space and we're going to execute them rateably, and on a predictable basis.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And so then, when I think about the $1 billion annually through 2021, and then the illustrative number of 1.2 to 1.4, So is it right to say that that gets you to your 25% IRR? Is that the way to think about it?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, so the way that we've talked about this, is we wanted to illustrate the fact that we did have attractive growth projects in place. And so, half of that capital is deemed to be refining projects, which have the higher 25% return threshold. Could be 24%, could be 28%. But they're typically in that range or better. And, on the logistics side, we know that those tend to be lower-risk projects, and so they tend to have lower return thresholds. And so that's where we use kind of a 12% to 15% threshold for. And that capital is split 50\/50 between those two categories. And if you just extrapolate out where that would take you, you get to your $1 billion to a $1.2 billion of incremental EBITDA resulting from a capital program that would be executed every year for the next five years.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, got you. And this is the last question. The open season on Keystone XL, are you guys still committed to take capacity to that line? And I guess especially given some of the issues going on in Venezuela, does that make it more important?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think we remain committed to the line, and we think that the U.S. Gulf Coast with the high complexity refining assets is best home for the growing production of Canadian crude. So, we're working a number of commercial options to continue to support that Pipeline.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Faisel.","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, most of this has been hit, but I guess maybe following up on the recent comments. One of the questions here on the export terminals in Port Arthur and Corpus. Recent headlines, the LOOP would be considering the possibility of exports, and I believe you've got an interest there.","So, how does that fit into the overall process? Does it change anything you would do? Or is it just a longer term enhancement?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Roger, this is Gary. I think what we understand is being contemplated at LOOP, at least in the short term, is a fairly small capital investment that will allow limited exports out of LOOP. We think around the neighborhood of 50,000 barrels a day, which in our mind is not really significant in terms of impacting the overall capability. But that's exactly what we're doing, is we're evaluating the existing logistics and the volume leaving, and when those logistics start to become taxed, then we can look at adding to those, either through what Rich talked about at Corpus or Port Arthur, as those opportunities become available to us.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Take a little while to fill up a VLCC at 50,000 barrels a day?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, it's exactly right.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, and then kind of getting back to some of the macro questions here. We've seen the northern or let's call it the Atlantic market, product market, tighten up quite a bit. Nice inventory draws here, and in Europe. Given that we've had really high throughputs here, what do you kind of identify as what's helped us see the market change from kind of Memorial Day to the 4th of July period? It didn't appear to be lower run rates here or in Europe. So I was just curious, did we see bigger product draws into markets that are harder for us to identify? I'm thinking Africa or anywhere else. Or was it just demand picked up?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think it was a combination. So, we certainly saw an increase in demand from the first quarter to second quarter domestically. And then we've seen a big pull into Mexico and South America that's really helped us create the inventory draws.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. I appreciate the help. Thanks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Roger.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to John Locke for closing remarks.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay, thanks, Vanessa. We appreciate everybody joining us today. Please contact our IR team if you have any additional questions. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating.

My name is Christine, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ashley Smith. You may begin.","Ashley M. Smith","Hey, thank you, Christine. And good morning, welcome to our earnings call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer; Kim Bowers, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel and several other members of our senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, feel free to contact me after the call.","Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we described in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike","Michael S. Ciskowski","Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported third quarter 2012 earnings of $674 million or $1.21 per share. This includes an after-tax noncash asset impairment loss of $341 million or $0.62 per share and after-tax severance expense of $41 million or $0.07 per share, primarily related to the Aruba Refinery as described in the earnings release financial tables under Notes D and E. Excluding these 2 items, third quarter earnings were $1.1 billion or $1.90 per share.","Operating income was $1.3 billion versus operating income of $2 billion in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the previously mentioned items, third quarter 2012 operating income was $1.7 billion.","The decrease in operating income was mainly due to lower refining margins in the U.S. Gulf Coast, West Coast and Mid-Continent regions. A decline in retail and ethanol margins also contributed to the decrease in operating income. These declines were somewhat offset by significantly higher refining margins in the North Atlantic region.","Our third quarter refining throughput margin was $3.12 per barrel, which is a slight decrease versus third quarter 2011 of $13.24 per barrel. The decrease in refining throughput margin was mainly due to lower discounts on crude oils and feedstocks and lower margins for other products, such as petrochemical feedstocks and propane. However, we saw higher margins for gasoline and diesel in all of our regions, and diesel had the highest margins among our major products.","Our third quarter 2012 refining throughput volume averaged 2.6 million barrels per day. That was up 8,000 barrels per day from the third quarter of 2011. The increase in throughput volumes was mainly due to the acquisitions of the Pembroke and Meraux refineries in 2011, which was nearly offset by the lack of throughput at Aruba, hurricane-related downtime and slowdowns at our St. Charles, Memphis and Meraux refineries and unplanned downtime at our Meraux refinery, as a result of the crude unit fire in July. The Meraux refinery restarted its crude unit in mid-October.","Excluding the Aruba severance expense, refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2012 were $3.72 per barrel, which was higher than the second quarter of 2012 mainly due to higher energy costs and increased maintenance expense. Operating expense though was lower than guidance due to lower than anticipated cost for catalysts than energy.","Our retail business reported quarterly operating income of $41 million, which includes a $12 million noncash asset impairment loss, as described in Note E to the financial tables. Retail operating income was $17 million in the U.S. and $24 million in Canada. The rising crude price environment squeezed retail fuel margins in both regions. Fuel volumes declined slightly compared to third quarter 2011 as weak gasoline demand impacted sales.","Our plan to separate our retail business and unlock value for our shareholders is moving forward. In October, we submitted our request to the IRS for a private letter ruling on a tax-efficient distribution of our retail business to our shareholders. Later this quarter, we expect to file a registration statement with the SEC. Given the timing of these events, we expect to complete the retail separation late in the first quarter or early second quarter of 2013.","Our Ethanol segment reported a $73 million operating loss in the quarter, which was down $180 million from the third quarter of 2011, mainly due to much lower gross margins as high corn prices and excess ethanol inventories squeezed the margins to very low levels. As a result of the low margins, we reduced our ethanol production to average 2.4 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2012, a decline of nearly 900,000 gallons per day compared to the third quarter of 2011.","The end of third quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $174 million, which was in line with our guidance. Depreciation and amortization expense was $402 million, and net interest expense was $70 million. The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 46%, but excluding the asset impairment losses and the Aruba severance expense, the tax rate was 35%.","Regarding cash flows in the third quarter, capital spending was $784 million, which includes a $75 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. We reduced our capital spending guidance for the full year 2012 to approximately 3. -- $3.5 billion versus prior year -- or prior guidance of around $3.6 billion. We expect 2013 capital spending to be $2.5 billion, and that includes approximately $200 million for our retail segment. Also in the third quarter, we paid $97 million in cash dividends to our shareholders.","With respect to our balance sheet at the end of September, total debt was $7 billion, cash was $2.5 billion and our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 20.6%. At the end of the third quarter, we also had nearly $5.7 billion of additional liquidity available.","Our key growth projects continue to move closer to startup. This week, we expect to begin commissioning activities at our Port Arthur hydrocracker project, and this unit should be operational in December. The St. Charles hydrocracker project remains on schedule to be fully operational in the second quarter of 2013.","On the macro side, we believe that Valero and other U.S. Gulf Coast refiners have several competitive advantages versus other Atlantic Basin refiners, including low-cost natural gas, increasing access to discounted domestic crude oil and larger, more complex and reliable refineries. These competitive advantages have enabled us to profitably take market share from less competitive Atlantic Basin refiners. This is exemplified by the high utilization rates in PADD 3 refiners and continued solid export demand for U.S. Gulf Coast products.","Now, I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.","Ashley M. Smith","Okay. Thanks, Mike. For modeling our fourth quarter operations, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: the Gulf Coast at 1.45 million to 1.5 million barrels per day, Mid-Continent at 440,000 to 450,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 275,000 to 285,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 320,000 to 330,000 barrels per day, which is lower than third quarter due to a plant-wide turnaround at the Pembroke refinery during most of October. Refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter are expected to be around $3.85 per barrel.","Regarding our ethanol operations in the fourth quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 2.5 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average approximately $0.40 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs, such as depreciation and amortization.","Also, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation to be around $190 million, and net interest expense should be around $70 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter should be around $405 million, and our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter should be approximately 36%.","Okay, Christine. That concludes our opening remarks. We'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.","Manav Gupta - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Manav for Evan today. I had just a couple of quick questions. One was on the West Coast refining margins. They were -- they came in slightly below the indicated margins. Just trying to understand what happened there.","Ashley M. Smith","We really didn't have margin guidance, so not sure what to reconcile for you. Maybe we should -- we can talk about it offline with a little more clarity on what you want us to reconcile to.","Manav Gupta - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm just trying to understand, because sequentially they were slightly lower, but the gasoline prices were higher in that region. So I'm trying to understand what happened there.","Ashley M. Smith","Yes.","William R. Klesse","As one would be that the branded prices as well as unbranded -- and you would be looking at the spot market prices. So as some of the markets were moving and a lot of that occurred in October, but it did occur some in September, that our average for gasoline products would be less than the spot market, than what we actually saw.","Ashley M. Smith","That's a contributing factor. Also some of our feedstock costs, we run a lot of EGO [ph] out there, even ANS. Some of those prices relative to benchmarks may not have kept up, so margins were impacted there, but there's no one key driver.","Manav Gupta - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just...","William R. Klesse","This is really by guess that it was somewhat on the 70-30 split. So that would raise our gas oil cost, as gasoline point of sale.","Manav Gupta - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And one more quick question. In the first quarter of next year, you have pipelines connecting the Permian Basin down to the Gulf Coast, whether it's Permian Express or reversal of Longhorn, so how would your refineries benefit from that?","S. Eugene Edwards","Well, these are WTI -- this is Gene Edwards. These are WTI-type crudes, sweet crudes and those pipelines come into the Houston area, so we can run those crudes in our Houston refinery along with the Guilford crude or any other crudes that -- such as [ph] sweet crudes in that area. We can also run some of that in our Texas City refinery as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert of Simmons.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","You guys provided some capital spending guidance for 2012 a little bit lower, 2013 maybe a little bit higher than previously discussed. Could you talk about opportunities for growth CapEx and maybe the major buckets that you see opportunity, infrastructure, flexibility to use more light crudes and anything else that you might see on the growth CapEx front?","William R. Klesse","Well, Ashley is looking for some numbers, Jeff. But the guidance that we've given you for '13 has always been $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And so as far as I'm concerned, we're still within our guidance. We've also pointed out that retail spending in that number is about $188 million, I think we rounded to $200 million. So as far as I'm concerned, we're still within our guidance. Now some -- clearly and I've said this, our St. Charles project is what we'd lost about 2 to 3 months from our original schedule. So based on what I gave maybe on the last call, we're on time with that. But from the original schedule, we're behind. So we have some carryover into '13 from that project, and that's largely -- there's $100 million reduction for this year sliding into next year. But basically, I consider us still within our range. And Ashley has some numbers for you.","Ashley M. Smith","Yes Jeff, so next year it looks like we'll spend between $950 million and $1 billion on strategic projects. It's distributed across several areas, several segments, but mostly it's in refining. In those strategic buckets, there's some crude expansions and a bit, some flexibility projects. As Bill mentioned, McKee and Port Arthur, Houston, just small spending across several of those, looking at projects that might allow us to get some more throughput through those hydrocrackers, the new ones at St. Charles and Port Arthur, plus Meraux. And there's other various logistics and biodiesel and retail and pipelines of terminals, things like that.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Secondly, in shifting Aruba towards a terminal, what do you see profitability looking like as a terminal in 2013? And how does that compare to the cost in Aruba in 2012? How do we think about year-on-year change?","William R. Klesse","Well, we lost, over the last several quarters, somewhere in the $8 million to $10 million a month in Aruba. And this year we lost over the last year or 2, in the order of, on average around $100 million, $120 million. One year was higher than the other. So we don't usually give that kind of info out, but we've had a loss in Aruba. And we believe that a terminal operation will be a good project for us there. We're still fixing some tanks, fixing the dock, things that we're doing and have been doing. But we expect the business, it'll test out for us in '13. With all the volatility we see in the markets, the forward curve, once it gets into contango in certain products, there's just a lot opportunity to start. And Aruba has very deep water. You can pull a d [ph] right into the docks, so we think it's a good project.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Kessler of TPH.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I had 2 questions for you. One is with the near elimination of light crude imports in the Gulf Coast, it begs a question in my mind. And that is ultimately, do you see the capability of loading some Gulf Coast-located light crude on a ship and moving it up to Quebec City and ultimately processing it there? I know it probably wouldn't work at today's spreads, but what sort of logistics might be involved? And what spread, let's say, between LLS and Brent or whatever benchmark you think is appropriate, might you need to make that happen? And then the other question is just if you would, remind me what your thoughts are on buybacks and when you might see a material program there?","William R. Klesse","On the first question on Quebec, some crude has already moved from the Gulf Coast to Canada, some out of Corpus Christi as well. That's actually where some of the economics work better. Freight cost average is maybe $2 a barrel or a little less, so it's all economic-driven compared as long as you have your license to export into Canada and some has already moved. And this is something that Valero will do, too, as other companies are looking at. We can run in Quebec somewhere in the 85% to 90% of our charge. There could all be basic -- basically light, sweet crude. And today, that's the -- even though it's a Canadian refinery, it runs imported oil, Algerian, CPC, North Sea, West Africa, it runs all those kind of crudes today. So for us, as we look at it, as the crude continues to cover the Gulf Coast, and we're quite convinced that the original premise we had a year or so ago is actually going to happen, there's going to be lots of light, sweet crude on the U.S. Gulf Coast, it's going to be looking for a home.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I think some people forget that refinery way up there might have seen the benefit from this, and thanks for that information. Can you tell me, do you  guys have any kind of market analysis on what you think the Eastern Coast of Canada, the refineries on the Eastern side of Canada could ultimately take as far as Gulf Coast based light crude?","William R. Klesse","Well, there's 4 refineries up there, and some run some medium sours as well, Irvin [ph], but really you need to kind of look that up. We would have an opinion, but we know better what we can do. And just to be totally -- so that you understand the whole situation. We expect to take wider crude oil, Syncrude and other crudes from the West as well, moving it into Montr\u00e9al and then getting it up to the Quebec refineries. So the feedstock slate for our Quebec refinery is going to change.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then buybacks?","William R. Klesse","Well, I've said all along that we think our stock, and actually, it's the whole refining industry but us in particular, we're undervalued when you sell it at 4x EBITDA. We have these projects coming on that I think separate us from the pack, so that when you -- our 2 hydrocrackers by the second quarter of next year will be major contributors. They are absolutely the right project for the right time. And so we think our stock is undervalued. But if I go to a ranking of -- and this is, I believe, absolutely consistent with what we said in the past, it's always safety and reliability first. We're improving our reliability around the system, and we continue to spend money to do that. Investment-grade rating is absolutely key. We have adequate cash to fund this business. As Mike said in his notes, we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash. We have lots of liquidity, as he also said. We're going to fund our projects through completion here. The Diamond Green Diesel project spills over, and frankly, we will expand both our hydrocrackers pretty much right out of the chute here as we get our permits. We continue to look for excellent investment opportunities. To be honest, some of our shareholders want to see the cash, and some of our shareholders want us to invest in good projects. So we continue to look for that. But we match that up against the comment I started with that our shares are undervalued. So that when we get to returning our cash to the shareholder, we've raised our dividends several times. And I have said that we want to have a yield that's among the highest in our peer group. And we have purchased our stock, we didn't purchase any stock in the third quarter as we've got our retail separation underway here, and we were building some liquidity. But we bought -- last year, we bought 17 million shares and this year, we've already bought 6 million shares. So we've actually demonstrated that as well. And so I think that's pretty well, I think we've been very consistent as to what we were doing.","Robert A. Kessler - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up. Anything that precludes you from buying back stock between now and the time of the retail spin?","William R. Klesse","No, there is nothing that does.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I've got 2 or 3 quick ones, hopefully. We haven't really seen weight -- weight-heavy differentials in quite a while. We seem to be seeing them right now. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the market that caused that? And on the same token, if you look at your runs, it looks like you upped your heavy runs this quarter and also your light runs. So a little bit, maybe some color around how those 2 things are interacting. And I've got a couple of quick follow-ups, please.","S. Eugene Edwards","Doug, this is Gene again. I think what's driving light heavy [indiscernible] has gotten a little bit weaker compared to where we had been. So with this running about $16 discount to Brent, so you've seen all the crudes follow that, including the Maya and the heavy sours. Probably more importantly, the medium sours. Those have been running in the $7 to $8 range discount to Brent over the last month or so, which is good. And WTF [ph] is also cheaper. So you throw all those in there, it's just given us better discounts on medium and heavy sour crudes.","Kristin Button - Moody's Corporation, Research Division","So are you meaning for a change in your slate, Gene, to adjust to that?","S. Eugene Edwards","Well, we're always optimized, and we run economics every day cargo by cargo, whether we -- sweets or TTT [ph]. LLS is trading about even to Brent. And remember that Brent is before transportation, so LLS is a big discount to Borden [ph] sweets. So we're always optimizing our slate every day because we have a lot flexibility in the system. And so we're just -- like I said, we're taking advantage of all.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great stuff. So my follow-ups are really 2 strategic questions. Let me group them together and see how best you can, and I just want you to be able to answer them. The first one is, I think though in the past, you've talked backwards and forwards about whether California was actually a core region for you going forward given the regulatory spending. There was a little bit of charter in the market a few weeks back that maybe there was some movement in that regard. I wonder if you could comment on that. And on the same vein, Mike and I had the opportunity to talk a little bit about what was going on in the summertime over the MLPs that were being listed in the form of refining, mainly northern tier. Now we've seen that thing wash out with a fairly substantial multiple uplift for refinery, which I think was a little different than it was though in the summer. So I'm wondering how that might have changed your view around, for example, Ardmore, McKee, some of the high cash-flowing assets and whether that's something you might want to consider down the road? And I'll leave it at those 2, please.","William R. Klesse","Well, Doug, on California, I have said that we continue to look at our options. We work for the shareholder, and we think that the regulatory environment in California is not constructive to the California economy. It's not constructive to the working person, and it's not constructive to our industry. Whether it's AB32 or whatever regulations we're faced with, but in AB32 particularly, the academics and the extremeness have hijacked the process. And they've made -- they're coming up with regulations that are totally not workable. So we look at our options, and we continue to look at our options. But on the other hand, we do not comment on rumors. On MLPs, our organization is really working on the retail separation. We would still consolidate. See, there is some financial theory here in that we borrow -- borrowing costs are very low. We're not in need of any cash, and so there is a discussion about this from the company that says any funds at the lowest cost. However, in acquisitions, it's clear that the MLP is an excellent acquisitions vehicle, the market clearly likes that approach. And we have some pipelines and turmoils that we can contribute to an MLP. So our strategy is to finish our retail separation, and then as I think Mike probably told you and we've said in the past, that we're going to look for MLP. The third part of your question is on the refining. And clearly, NTI has traded better here, because initially, it did not trade that well. But it is these type of assets, as you know, and as the others on the call know, their high cash flow is, in fact, tied to the WTI, LLS or Brent spread. I mean refining is all about location today. And if you're in the right location, your cash flows are huge. But there is a forward curve or a forward expectation. And so you get into a conversation of what you could actually realize doing that today. We think that would not necessarily result in an advantage to our shareholders.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could I push you a little bit on the pipeline and terminals, because obviously, new start, kind of, I guess, as all the legacy stuff, what is the appetite and what is the potential scale in terms of current EBITDA that you would associate with those pipelines and terminals because I was under the impression you did not have a whole heck of a lot left.","William R. Klesse","Well, we can -- we would have somewhere between $50 million and $100 million of EBITDA just dealing straight, like just taking terminals and pipelines. And remember, we are partners with Kinder Morgan on the Parkway pipeline. We have our big pipeline project in Canada, which is just about finished here, and again, ready to start up. So we have assets in our system. But also, we have package and other things that are being dropped in MLPs as well. So we would have -- it would be a small MLP, but it wouldn't be any smaller, I guess, than a couple of the others out there. And we would have the opportunity to drop other assets as we go through the future. So we'll look at it. We've said we were going to look at it, but our focus today is really on the retail separation, because we do believe that adds significant shareholder value. And I might add, we don't think the stock -- our stock reflects that value.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A number of quick questions. Actually, can you remind me the retail spin of your ethanol facility is going to be included, or it's going to stay with the Valero?","Ashley M. Smith","Ethanol segment is going to stay with Valero. That's not part of their planned asset.","William R. Klesse","The retail spin in the United States -- the retail separation in the United States is the company-operated stores. It's 1,025. And it's the 775 stores, 250 of which we own, and the rest where we control the price or manage the price at the pump in Canada. That is the business that we are separating, including home heating and car block in Canada.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, perfect. Secondly, if I look at the number, next year CapEx is 2.5. And I think Ashley said that strategic, there's probably 90 [ph] to a billion, and 200 is for retail. So that means that the remaining sustaining capital is about 1.3 for the refining and the ethanol together. Is that a reasonable proxy as ongoing sustaining capital, or that next year's particularly high or particularly low?","William R. Klesse","I've given out in the past with our business, and I would say DD&A runs for us about 1.4 billion. It's going to change a little bit with the hydrocrackers, obviously. It will go up probably 100 million. So then we have retail come out. I think the sustaining capital is really in the 1 5, 1 6, and that's the number that I've given to people. 1 5, 1 6, 1 7 in all the past. Next year, we're finishing some projects, it might be a little lower next year. Turnarounds catalysts are $600 million a year for us. So I think this 1 5 to 1 7, the numbers we've given in the past, are the right numbers.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bill, the 1 5 to 1 7, is that including retail or not including retail?","William R. Klesse","Well, sustaining capital, it would include retail in my conversation...","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So the retail sustaining is probably 150, 200 right?","William R. Klesse","It's very small for retail as sustaining capital. It's very small. So I think my range of this 1 5 to 1 7 is a good range for you guys to think of us as sustaining capital for the refining pipeline terminal business that we have.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Very good. Mike, on the North Atlantic, the sequential margin, up about $5 from the second quarter. If I look at the benchmark indicator, whether it's in Europe or in the Northeast market, does not go up by $5. So the question is that, is there any one-off benefit in the North Atlantic we should take into consideration? Or that you think is, really they're running well and is more like a normal run rate that we can base on going forward?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Okay. In the North Atlantic, I think the marketing operations performed fairly well during this period, which would have given it a little bit of margin above that.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I see. Mike, on -- in the past, as you guys mentioned that you have unplanned downtime, both with [indiscernible] and on penalties in Meraux. You have any kind of cost estimate, opportunity cost estimate related to this downtime in the quarter?","William R. Klesse","Well, the lost revenue for Meraux, which some spilt into October, but was $53 million. And then it took us about $16 million for the repair.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","$16 million?","William R. Klesse","$16 million for the repair. Now, we did a lot of reliability work while the unit was down. But the lost opportunity was...","Ashley M. Smith","$53 million for the crude and then another $13 million just for the hurricane impact.","William R. Klesse","So between the 2, 66 between the 2 events just for Meraux.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just from Meraux. How about the Isla [ph] impact on the other facility?","Ashley M. Smith","It's -- St. Charles was shut down, and it was about a $34 million impact on gross margin.","William R. Klesse","From the hurricane.","Ashley M. Smith","Yes, from the hurricane.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And can you guys share with us some, maybe market data about the retail in your only retail network that the gasoline same-store sales in October, how's that looked? And also that -- how's the export so far in October comparing to the third quarter?","William R. Klesse","So on this retail store sales in the October, how did they look compared to September?","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, comparing to the year ago October on a same store year-over-year.","S. Eugene Edwards","We're running flat.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Running flat?","S. Eugene Edwards","To last year.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","How about export?","William R. Klesse","Okay. Now export back to the refining group, exports right now are back up from the third quarter level for diesel. And now in the third quarter, exports were down as the harbors closed for part of the time. On gasoline, they've been about -- they were running at 75,000 barrel a day range.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And for the hydrocracker, Bill, you had delay, as you say that on maybe 2 or 3 months, is that result in any change in your overall cost estimate, or it's pretty much still about the same?","William R. Klesse","No, it has changed our cost estimate. And again, these are numbers -- they're not changed, I think, from when I've seen -- saw you. But at our Port Arthur, we still expect to underrun that project. But at St. Charles, we are overrunning the project. And so on total, they're on budget, when you add them both together, very close to being on budget. But clearly, the delay at St. Charles is costing us additional money. Now, all I say to you is for Valero -- I know Exxon and these guys do big projects. For Valero, these are huge projects for us, and our people are managing these pretty darn gone well. But we're just a few months behind.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two final questions. One, do have any committed to the Enbridge Line 9 reversal to ship barrel, so that you can take it from there, from Montr\u00e9al up into Quebec City?","William R. Klesse","Well, the answer is yes, we do, assuming they can get their permits to reverse the pipeline into Montr\u00e9al, and this was why I added that to the other question earlier. But we have a commitment to ship on that line along with Suncor.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bill, can you share with us how big is that commitment?","William R. Klesse","Petro Canada.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Final one. On the hydrocracker, I guess that with the dividend growth, the next dividend increase or reconsideration by the board, do we need to wait until the hydrocracker, both of them come on stream or that even after Port Arthur will come on stream, you will feel more confident about your cash flow and would be able to relook at your regular dividend, given I think a lot of your loan accounts perhaps that may be more in kind [indiscernible] back of a dividend than the share buyback.","William R. Klesse","Right now on the dividend, management will have a recommendation either to hold it or stay the same but it is a board item. It will go through our forecast with our board. Our hydrocrackers, honest, they're not up and running yet but those are, as you properly stated, are significant. And so this will be a board discussion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is that discussion going to be, say, have to wait until after both of them come on stream or even after one of them come on stream that we'll have that discussion already?","William R. Klesse","Paul, I respect your question. I understand what you're asking, but I'm going to answer you that you're not going to be satisfied. And what I'm going to say is we as management will have a recommendation for our board, and we will discuss that it the board meeting. We want a dividend that we can sustain, and we also want a dividend that's going to yield, as I said, the highest among our peers. And we'll look at that as well as my other comment where we think our stock is undervalued. So I am just going to say to you that it's a board item and it will be discussed.","Operator","Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I had 2 questions for you. One was on the Retail. If I understood correctly, you were previously evaluating either a spin or a sale. It sounds like if I'm reading correctly, you've eliminated the sale option and now just simply pursuing the spin, is that correct?","William R. Klesse","That is not correct. We are pursuing a separation, but our board has only authorized us to do the analysis around this. I know we used the words that things are moving forward, but we do not even have board approval for a separation. We have board approval to look at this, and we all realize that there's a shareholder value accretion that we've spoken about. But we are going through here to make sure that we maximize shareholder value and at the same time, treat the business and our people correctly as well.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then the second was on M&A. I guess it's kind of a twofold question. One, obviously, Murphy seems to be a little bit more aggressive in exiting the R&M business, and it's always been, I guess, envisioned that Valero is a natural buyer of Milford Haven. Just curious if you have any thoughts there. And then secondly, just from a broader M&A standpoint, now that Texas City is off the market and Alliance [ph] has been removed, it seems like most of the major assets have been kind of plucked off at this point. I'm just curious, Valero, you've been historically fairly active on the acquisition front, is it fair to think that we kind of move away from that and more just to a free cash flow generator?","William R. Klesse","Well, there's a lot of issues there, Blake. As far as specific assets, whether it's Murphy, Milford Haven or other things that are in the market, we tend to look at these acquisitions, are they going to integrate with our system? That's why we like the Meraux, as it integrated with St. Charles and frankly, our other the Gulf Coast plants. We're of the mind in the U.S. that demand is not going to grow certainly for gasoline. Maybe there's some bounce if people get back to work but long term, gasoline is not growing. Diesel will have some growth, but it still hasn't recovered from the great recession, and it will be years before it does. So whatever we tend to look at, we're looking at in a way the Atlantic Basin and being able to be a stronger competitor in the export business. So all the things that we look at, we want to be able to say at the end of the day that we've been able to integrate this and actually are lowering the cost from the womb to the tomb. So we continue to look, and at least our experience here would be that other assets will come to the market because the refining industry is going to continue to consolidate the United States and Western Europe. There's just no doubt in my mind about that. So we'll continue to look. So I would not say that we're not an active player, but we are after things that make us more competitive as we have to deal in the export market.","Operator","Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just to, I guess, follow up a little bit on the export and maybe talk a little bit about global capacity you see on the horizon in '13. If I understood correctly 75,000 barrels a day of gasoline in Q3, I didn't catch the distillate number, but what do you see is the capability to grow that in '13? And then, what are you going to be pushing against in terms of identified global growth that you may be pushing back, could impact margins, et cetera?","William R. Klesse","Well, our exports in the third quarter were about 118,000 on diesel just so you have -- 118,000 barrels a day. That was actually down from where we've been averaging, which is somewhere just on average 175,000 barrels a day. Now, and our industry then has been exporting 1 million barrels a day of diesel. And somewhere in the 400,000 to 500,000 barrels -- 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day of gasoline. So Valero is somewhere in the range of 20% or so of the export business in that range. Now there is capacity that comes into the market. Refining capacity is being built. Also the world demand is going up. We still expect for next year because you were talking about '13, that the world will increase, we think maybe 1 to 1.2 million barrels a day of consumption, so it can absorb some of this additional capacity. The U.S. is the most economic place here, low natural gas costs, some discounts or at least parity with world prices for sweet crude, and then we also have very fine operating people. So we think we can compete in the business and the business grows. It doesn't change my statement though that I've made in the past, and that is Western Europe is long refining for sure. And without exports, the United States is long refining for sure. So things will continue to rationalize in those markets going forward, but we think we can compete, one as a company and two as an industry. And the markets continue to grow. The third thing I would add to that conversation is all the Brazilian refineries that you read so much about, they're late and they're costing them a lot more. One is getting done here but the others are -- they're going to spend a huge amount of money if they actually proceed with them. The Venezuelan refineries are in disarray. And certainly, the debate continues as to what Mexico does, and the facts are the Mexican economies grow and the Brazilian economies are growing. So for companies like us located on the Gulf Coast, we think we can get into these markets and be doggone competitive. And Europe continues to be systemically short diesel on an annual basis.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So as a follow-up to that, where do you think your export volumes can go next year? I mean obviously you have the hydrocrackers coming online, which are going to grow volumes for you. Nobody I think believes the U.S. is going to be in a robust growth mode next year. So I mean, the exports are very much the outlet. Where are you in terms of actual keyside capacity and ability to roll this out?","William R. Klesse","That's a general -- and that's very fair question. It's a general statement because Motivo [ph] will eventually be back as well. And so Europe will basically take somewhere around half of our diesel exports, and the rest of the diesel exports are going to the Caribbean and other places. On gasoline, primarily Mexico, Colombia, Brazil and you may see a cargo or 2 go over to West Africa. Our Quebec refinery, just as a little side note, has been able to export diesel into New York Harbor. So -- but clearly, it's the same places as they continue to grow. Reaching out further, they would all be ad hoc. But remember, the Gulf Coast market is extremely liquid market.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Absolutely. Okay. And then my last question for you, on ethanol, obviously, a really tough quarter. Looking at the volumes you ran in the third quarter and what you're indicating as reasonable volumes for the fourth quarter, what changes, if anything, versus the fairly significant loss we saw in the third quarter as we look at the fourth? I mean, if volumes are going to be slightly higher, is that an indication that there's a little bit better margin story here than what we've been seeing?","S. Eugene Edwards","This is Gene again. We've got good margins in probably 5 of our plants. We have 2 plants that are basically down. We're keeping the enzymes active, so we'll start up a couple of days a month on those, but there's 2 of them down and there's 3 plants that are cut back. So we're running 2.4, 2.5 million gallons a day of capacity of about 3.6. So we're running probably about right at 2\/3 utilization. So we see margins improve. We had a big loss in third quarter. We're about breakeven on an EBITDA basis now with the plants on a consolidated basis, but it's still not nearly as good as it was last year in the fourth quarter. And inventories are still basically at 17.3 million barrels, which are up about 1.5 million barrels from last year. So until we work that off, I don't see that we're going to get a big pop in margins. But we did draw about 204,000 barrels a day last week. So if we keep drawing at that pace, in a month or 2, we can claim some of this off, so it just depends on the demand. Imports have been the big factor. You don't have a lot of imports from Brazil recently. They've announced they're going to go from 20% of their gasoline pool to 25%. I think we'll see some of those imports slow down a little bit and then plus they're at the end of their harvest season for sugar. So I think that should diminish. So I think the market will continue to clean itself up. It's just taking longer than it normally has.","William R. Klesse","And for us, corn prices have stabilized where they were moving around so much. They've kind of stabilized here at the $7.40 a bushel area.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just a little follow-up on that. How quickly can you react within your ethanol plants to those market conditions changing? Are you as agile as in refining is literally a daily basis change or, any help along those lines on your flexibility?","S. Eugene Edwards","Yes, it's pretty quick. If the margin were to improve next week, we can source more corn. The plants that are running obviously just seems to start increasing right away. And then the other 2 plants that have been down, we have been doing these monthly refreshes to keep the enzymes active, so you can get them started up on a short notice. We'll probably decide, going into the winter though you notice when you get colder weather there, do we -- if the plant is down, that's a big problem with a lot of water in the system, so we'll probably have to make a decision in the next month or so where we're going to try to start up here in the winter or just leave those 2 plants down throughout the rest of the winter. We'll be watching the market closely on that.","Operator","Our next question is from Rakesh Advani of Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","It's Ed Westlake actually. So you mentioned an interesting number, which is $2 to get crude from, I guess, the Gulf up to your Canadian facilities. That seems low for a Jones Act ship. Is there something funny going on? And maybe talk to how much crude you could move with the existing shipping that's available on that route. And then I have a follow-on question.","William R. Klesse","Well, Ed, I'm surprised with you on the Jones Act ship. Canada is not the United States. It's still part of the British Commonwealth though.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. Yes, indeed. And my wife is Canadian, so I should know that. So effectively you use just regular shipping, and that's why it's so cheap. Do you -- would you have a number if you had to ship crude up to -- do you think if the industry had to ship crude up to the East Coast?","William R. Klesse","Well, sure it would be -- it's 3x. So it's very, very... Go ahead, Gene.","S. Eugene Edwards","Well, Phillips has announced something. It was in the press that they're shipping their barrels up to their neighbor refinery and I think they got a deal of $4.50 a barrel or so.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. That's helpful. And then the follow-on question is around sort of the advantage position you have even in the Gulf, I think around 900,000 barrels a day capacity in Texas. Obviously, with the Eagle Ford and the Permian growing quickly, those refineries are kind of in the line of fire of that crude growth whereas it probably cost a little bit more and then maybe some bottlenecks to get crude over to the Louisiana refineries. Do you have any sort of numbers for us that could help in terms of quantifying how much of a dollar a barrel advantage you have in West Texas?","William R. Klesse","Well, I would say to you, Ed, Gene and I will try to answer you. It's probably $1. Once you put it on the ship, you got to load it, you have all these costs to get on a ship. So if you assume sweet crude oil, say, from Corpus Christi to Meraux, I would say you'd have at least $1 dollar advantage at Corpus.","S. Eugene Edwards","Yes, I think it's $1 or $2. And furthermore, Houston and Corpus are probably going to be a similar parity. And what's going to clear the Houston to St. James market is going to be the SOHO line, which is going to be their quoted [indiscernible], $2 a barrel on that. So I think you got at least $1 a barrel to Houston, and probably 2 barrels -- $2 for Corpus Christi kind of the memo. And then as you get up to McKee, obviously the numbers get even more discounted because of the -- you've got to clear the seaway pipeline tariff, or the long-haul reversal or these type of tariffs too, and is an advantage for McKee and our board.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, so generally, you'd say that West Texas is about $2 discount to LLS in Louisiana and then so maybe some additional advantages for being initial off takers for some of the crude providers from the Permian and Eagle Ford?","William R. Klesse","Now we want to be clear on this. Once you get  it to the water, Gene was speaking, if you have crude in West Texas, you have that tariff to get it to Houston or Cushing and then Cushing to Houston. So then that tariff on these pipelines being built. I thought we were answering your question as moving it on the Gulf Coast. You have it already in Eagle Ford and Corpus Christi or you have a crude in Houston. And those are the numbers Gene was giving you. If you're talking about Midland or Cushing, you have to incur that tariff as well.","Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I know. I was just talking about moving stuff along the Gulf, so it's been very helpful.","S. Eugene Edwards","A follow-up to that is we're talking to our crude traders about that, taking crude from Corpus to Louisiana by U.S. flag is about the $2 a barrel, is about the same as foreign flags into Canada at $2 barrel. Kind of amazing.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Terreson of ISI.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Bill, the delivered cost advantage for U.S. exporters is pretty clear, but just to clarify something you said a minute ago, did you say that your exports were a little weaker recently? And if I heard that correctly, were there regional markets that were taking less product and why or was it something else?","William R. Klesse","In the third quarter, our distillate exports were down from second and down from what we expect in the fourth. And that had to do with the arb, it had to do with inventories. There was just a lot of reasons.","S. Eugene Edwards","There's also the hurricane outage on the Gulf Coast.","William R. Klesse","And Gene is right, we had the hurricane on the Gulf Coast as well. So that -- and that's actually -- and what happened is the domestic markets were very strong so the arb wasn't open. And we run on economics.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","High-quality problem. And then also, in California, you've been very consistent over the years with your views on the regulatory regime. And when you make your strategic assessment on your positions out there, is it the compliance cost for the new standards in '13 or '15 that represent the greatest concern or is it something more broad? And either way, is there an order of magnitude that you can give us as it relates to the cost structure that would be likely related to regulations in California?","William R. Klesse","Well, it's an excellent question. Actually, this AB32 -- so the cap and trade program that's starting now and the low carbon fuels that tend to restrict which types of crude you can run, these programs are all starting. So the basic issue on low profitability in the West Coast has actually been crude sourcing, so do people have an advantage crude source. And secondly, we still have over 10% unemployment now in California. California is 2\/3 of the pack. So when you start to look at this, demand is down, and there's too much refining capacity. So you see this, Doug, and as the others on the call see, when there's an operating issue in California, the market quickly balances and margins improve. And then when everybody's back and running, we all tend to run down to cash cost. And that's what as you would imagine, that's what happens, but my concern and the concern of Valero, and our management team here is longer term, the policies that are going -- being discussed, the way they're talking about implementing them is bad, as I said earlier, for people, for business and certainly for our industry. So that's a longer term decision [ph]. The shorter term is really just basic supply and demand and a very sluggish economy in the West Coast.","Operator","Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question on the Eastern, the Northeast market, you saw a pretty wide basis differential in the Northeast this last quarter. And I'm just trying to think around exactly how much product you guys are pushing into the Northeast? You talked about the arb kind of closing, but I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more in terms of how much gasoline you were pushing into the Northeast to take advantage of that and wide basis differential that we saw?","William R. Klesse","I don't think we would have that number. Remember, we tend to sell in the Gulf Coast markets and into the Southeast. And then Canada services it's local market and it's been able, as I said a few minutes ago, to put some barrels into New York Harbor. But we're not per se pushing anything domestically into the East Coast. Now from Pembroke, we export to the U.S. East Coast. And I don't think I know that number.","S. Eugene Edwards","The only thing I'd add, we do sell to those people that ship on Colonial pipeline and maybe are taking our barrels to the East Coast, and then it's after we've already relinquished control.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Understood. You're selling the barrels to the Gulf Coast and somebody else is moving those barrels farther north and take advantage of that differential to some degree?","William R. Klesse","They have pipelines based on pipelines, so I guess that's right. Now we would have gotten advantage of it for Pembroke.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Bill, on the hydrocrackers, when will be the first quarter for each hydrocracker of complete uptime, if you will? When do we now expect them to be running at full operations?","William R. Klesse","Okay, Port Arthur, the full quarter will be the first quarter of '13.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So that will be a full quarter?","William R. Klesse","Full quarter. We expect to be up in December. And at St. Charles, to answer your question, the first full quarter might be the third quarter. But we expect to be up in April, okay? But I'm answering your question, full quarter, it will be the third quarter of St. Charles.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And then...","William R. Klesse","Now if things go a little better, we could have the second quarter, but as I've said and I don't know when you joined the call, these are very large projects for us, and we're getting them done and we're getting them done safely.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. And you've been pretty clear with the guidance on what they'll make based on some fairly conservative assumptions. Could you just remind me what those would be if the guidance still remains the same? What your expectation for let's say the quarterly or annual earnings would be for each unit for each project? And then if you could also roll that forward if possible into what it would be making in the current environment, that would be great.","William R. Klesse","Actually, we may have some numbers. But we've been typically have been giving you guidance, we give you all the assumptions in our appendix of our presentations, but it's about $1 billion worth of EBITDA. And we gave you all the assumptions. And you can see it when we have a case, I think it was $1.2 billion. We had another one, and I don't know what it would be today, but it's $1 billion of EBITDA. And we think they're going to contribute over $1 dollar share to earnings. Remember, it's natural gas, the hydrogen to distillates primarily, and we have a good distillate cracker as well.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Obviously the main thing is just to get them running.","William R. Klesse","That we all agree, and we're going to do it in a very orderly manner.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Surely. Forgive me, do you increase your CapEx guidance for next year? I know it's sort of a Mickey Mouse question, but could you just confirm what's on the CapEx numbers? I don't have full access to information yet.","William R. Klesse","Paul, we did, in my opinion, as we got the question earlier, we did not increase our guidance. I've said all along $2 billion to $2.5 billion. What we're doing here is saying we're at $2.5 billion. In that $2.5 billion is $188 million that has to do with retail. Assuming that we proceed with the separation of Retail, and Mike we're saying if that all happens, it's a second quarter event, late first quarter, early second quarter, then that amount of the capital would come down pro rata here for spending.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, and then you've kicked off -- I was listening of course, so you've kicked around some numbers as for what we could assume -- I know it's early but for 2014, assuming that you're going to basically pursue a strategy now more oriented towards capital limitation and more towards cash return to shareholders.","William R. Klesse","Well, I would say that in 2013, we've given you the guidance, and it's been consistent with what we've been saying here for the last 6 months. We've said that we want to have a dividend yield that's among the highest with our peer group. But I'm not giving any guidance for 2014.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Just an observation that Sandy I think is going to have a pretty significant demand impact. As you can imagine, there's no traffic lights right now on Manhattan, which obviously conjures up a nightmarish image but at the same time there's so few cars around that is actually more or less safe to drive, but I guess again you made some observations on your best guess of what the impact will be, right?","William R. Klesse","Well, I don't think we would know any more than you. You're very astute at this. Obviously, the refineries either shut down or reduce significantly. But the facts are demand is going to be way off as well. And so I don't think we can -- we would have any better insight at this point than you do. But obviously, demand is off as well as the refineries. I will say this, at least reading some of the commentary and this is good for people and everything, that some of the refineries did not incur any damage.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, I mean, what I would think is that because of the PADD 1 is essentially import-dependent from other places that the demand impact is more important than the supply impact, which doesn't seem that bad.","William R. Klesse","That's correct. And Paul reminds me, for all of you on the call here with this Hurricane Sandy, we thank you all for calling in, and we hope you didn't incur any damage or your loved ones or families. Hope everything is okay as you get your power back and everything else that goes with you.","Operator","Our next question is from Chi Chow of Macquarie Capital.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Back on the Retail separation. Bill, in the event of a spinoff to shareholders, does Valero intend to retain any interest in that new Retail entity?","William R. Klesse","We are working all options as you would expect us to. If we did, it would be in the financing vein. But we are, today, looking at cases of complete separation, but we have financing options.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Okay. I guess there's some chatter from the credit agencies when you made the announcement on possible changes to the ratings for Valero. With the separation of Retail, are you concerned about that at all? Have you had further discussions with the agencies? Can you talk a little bit about that?","William R. Klesse","Sure. Yes, one of the agencies did have some concern. And as we get our case solidified here, we'll go in and visit with them and show them our numbers. And we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash, and so I think we're very strong financially. Our net debt to cap is 20%. But we're going to go in and we'll show them our numbers and we'll have the discussion that you would expect us to have.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Okay. In the event of any changes, does that change your position on buybacks going forward?","William R. Klesse","Well, I don't know the answer to the first question, but we think our stock is undervalued. But I've also consistently, and Mike has said this as well and Ashley, we believe with our size and the way we deal with our suppliers that having an investment-grade debt rating is extremely important to our business.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Right. Okay. And then on your comments on the growth CapEx, you mentioned you've got some projects looking at increasing crude throughput capacity. Do have any details on the specific plans and incremental capacity you're contemplating?","William R. Klesse","No. But as you would -- these would only be in situations where we're out of balance with feedstocks. So that we -- for instance in Corpus Christi, when you look at our capacity relative to our crude -- conversion capacity relative to our crude capacity, it's out of balance. And yet now we're in a world where there's a lot more crude oil production coming at us locally that's advantaged. Instead of buying imported feedstocks we need to be looking at generating our own feedstocks. So we have quite a study going on, for instance, at Corpus Christi and our Houston Refinery, where at the Houston Refinery we have a very large cat cracker and yet, we don't have a lot of crude capacity. So these are the things that tie to our whole strategy statement that I spoke about earlier where we look at things that continue to, in the essence, lower our overall cost to produce from the womb to the tomb. And those are the kind things we're looking at. Now at McKee, we've talked about it for about 2 years, we're getting closer to getting some of these permits, but we've said we wanted to expand McKee, and that's been out there. I think you guys are tired of hearing me talk about it. But as soon as -- we have -- we've broken the project into 2 pieces. There's a energy project but there is a crude expansion piece. And we do not have the permit for the crude expansion piece, and it's turned into perpetuity.","Operator","Our next question is from Harry Mateer of Barclays.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It sounds like you think your financial leverage is at an appropriate level, so do you see scope for further debt reduction? And I guess related to that, how should we be thinking about the, I guess, $480 million of maturities in the first half of next year? Is that -- are you thinking that's a use of cash or more like it would be refinanced?","William R. Klesse","No, we -- our plan today would be to take out the $480 million. Mike? $180 million in January, $300 million in June, July. And our plan today is to take it out. That will take our debt down -- our long-term debt down to $6.5 billion to date. And yes, we'll be very strong financially, but that is our plan for that specific model. Then you asked general debt. We do not have any other debt that we find economic to call or to redeem. And then in 2014, we only have $200 million of debt that is due. So in our particular case, we do not have debt that would go out and retire economically. We do $480 million and '14, we do the $200 million, but that's where we are.","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sorry, guys, for the follow-up. It's a very quick one, Bill. I wanted to come back to AB32. I know it's a bit of a thorn on your side. But in the event that you have to incur meaningful capital expenditure, at what point would you have to start implementing those projects? In other words, how early before 2020 does this actually become an issue for spending? Now if you could quantify it, that would really be appreciated.","William R. Klesse","Okay. I'm going to answer you, Doug, that we are all whispering here. There's no capital per se. Now part of the regulation is 1\/3 of your power cost is going to come from renewables and -- in 2020. And our cost in California today for power is $0.12 per kilowatt, and that's like 3x the cost at McKee. And as you go to these renewables, and this would be at Wilmington, so L.A., as you go toward this direction, our power cost will increase more because renewables are not economic. And so we have some options to generate our own power and are looking at that project. But as a philosophy, right now, Valero is very reluctant to spend any capital in California. The other piece of this, to give you the whole 9 yards, we generate hydrogen at our Benicia Refinery, and the facts are we could build another hydrogen plant there, that would be $200 million to $300 million and would reduce our carbon footprint. But again, I would say those are out in the future year because quite frankly, these rules aren't even set yet. And at least some people in California are at least -- are now starting to talk about the financial impact this is going to have in the state on everybody. So I think some of it remains to be seen but generally speaking, there are no capital. There are expenditures if you have to start paying for tailpipe, carbon and certainly our stationary source. And I don't mind saying, I think the last number we have, our California stationary source is like 3.7 million metric tons a year. So you can start figuring out those kind of numbers as well. And all it's going to do is we're going to pass it through.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. So I'll now turn the call back over to Ashley Smith.","William R. Klesse","So let me just say to everybody, good to know that a lot of you on the East Coast have issues, so thank you for making an effort to join our call. And as I said earlier, we hope that you have not incurred too much damage to your home or any of your friends or your loved ones.","Ashley M. Smith","Yes. Thanks, Bill. Yes, we wish all you guys in the Northeast a safe and speedy recovery, back to your normal situation. And thank you for listening to the call. If you have any questions or follow-up, just call the IR department. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time.","And I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. John Locke. Sir, you may begin.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning. Welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. We started the year with bullish fundamentals, healthy product demand and days of supply for total light products below the five-year range. However, as the quarter progressed, winter storms, fog along the Gulf Coast and strong refinery utilization delayed seasonal product draws, creating some margin headwinds.","But despite these challenges, Valero performed well and delivered solid financial results. As you know, we've been investing growth capital in logistics projects. An excellent example of this is the Diamond Pipeline, which is running well and enabling us to capture additional margin into our refining system.","We increased pipeline throughput during the quarter, which provided our Memphis refinery with greater access to Cushing and Midland crudes that are cost advantage versus LLS. We made additional investments in logistics to further reduce secondary costs and increase margin capture.","We acquired the SemLogistics Milford Haven fuel storage facility in Wales. We also entered into a joint ownership agreement with Sunrise Pipeline LLC, a new pipeline connecting Midland and Wichita Falls, Texas. Construction also continues on the Central Texas pipelines and terminals and the Pasadena products terminal. We expect these investments to improve flexibility in product and feedstock supply in our refineries when completed in 2019 and 2020.","Turning to our refining investments. Work remains on track for the Diamond Green Diesel capacity expansion and the Houston and St. Charles alkylation units. These projects should start up between the third quarter of this year and 2020. In addition, our board of directors approved the construction of a 45-megawatt cogeneration plant at the Pembroke refinery. We expect to see lower operating costs and improved electricity and steam supply reliability when the project is completed in 2020.","Turning to cash returns to stockholders. We paid out 57% of our first quarter adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. And we continue to target an annual payout ratio of between 40% to 50%.","In closing, we remain optimistic about the margin environment for the year. Global economies are growing. Product demand is strong, particularly in Latin America. And days of supply refine light product inventories are below five-year averages. With our highly reliable and flexible refining system, we are well positioned to capture margin tailwinds arising from these positive trends.","And with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Thank you, Joe. For the first quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $469 million or $1.09 per share compared to $305 million or $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $431 million or $1 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany this release.","Operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2018 was $922 million compared to $640 million for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding $170-million benefit from the retroactive Blender's Tax Credit and $10 million of expenses, primarily related to ongoing repairs at certain of our refineries to address damage resulting from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and other increment weather conditions the first quarter of 2018, operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $762 million.","The increase from 2017 is attributed primarily to higher distillate margins, which were partially offset by narrower discounts for medium and heavy sour crudes versus Brent.","Refinery throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 93,000 barrels per day higher than the first quarter of 2017. Throughput capacity utilization was 94% in the first quarter of 2018. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.78 per barrel were $0.09 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2017, mainly due to higher throughput in the first quarter of 2018.","The ethanol segment generated $45 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $22 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 was primarily due to stronger distillers grain prices.","Operating income for the VLP segment in the first quarter of 2018 was $84 million compared to $70 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 was attributed mainly to contributions from the Port Arthur terminal assets and Parkway Pipeline, which were acquired in November of 2017.","For the first quarter of 2018, general and administrative expenses were $238 million and net interest expense was $121 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $498 million and the effective tax rate, excluding the retroactive Blender's Tax Credit, was 22% in the first quarter of 2018.","With respect to our balance sheet at quarter-end, total debt was $9 billion, and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.7 billion, of which $71 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 24%. At the end of March, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $750 million was available for only VLP.","We generated $138 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter. Included in this amount is a $1.1-billion use of cash to fund working capital. Excluding working capital, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately 1.2 billion.","Moving to investing activities. We made $631 million of growth and sustaining capital investments, of which $448 million was for expenditures to sustain the business, including $220 million for turnaround and catalyst costs. The balance of capital invested in the quarter was for growth.","With regard to financing activities. We returned $665 million to our stockholders in the first quarter. $345 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 3.5 million shares of Valero common stock. As of March 31, we have approximately $3.5 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.","Capital investments for 2018 are expected to total $2.7 billion with about $1.7 billion allocated to sustaining the business and $1 billion to growth. Included in the total are turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments.","For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.61 million to 1.66 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 460,000 to 480,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 280,000 to 300,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 355,000 to 375,000 barrels per day.","We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $3.85 per barrel. Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of four million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.","For 2018, we continue to expect the annual effective tax rate to be about 22%. For the second quarter, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $180 million. Net interest expense is estimated at $120 million. And total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $520 million.","Lastly, we expect RINs expense for the year to be between $500 million and $600 million, which is approximately $200 million lower than previous guidance, primarily due to lower RINs prices.","That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we will again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Good morning, everybody.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Hey. So, first I want to say congratulations to Mike and that I've enjoyed working with you over the years and good luck in the future, first of all.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","You're welcome. And my question is on IMO 2020 and specifically how you guys are thinking about the type of products that are likely to be provided to the market as it seems that many fuels are still in the design phase and there's a lot of uncertainty in that area. And on marine fuel blends, how challenging the issues of compatibility, stability and availability of supply along these marine fuel networks are likely to be as the market goes through the transition in coming years? So two questions on IMO 2020.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Doug. This is Gary. I think I'll start with the latter part of it. I think you really hit the nail on the head in terms of the challenges on IMO and the fuel quality. A lot of these blends, it's about stability of the fuel. And so we're certainly doing a lot of work in that area to understand some of these blends and things that can be done to be able to produce the 0.5-way percent (13:05) spec.","But because a lot of those challenges, certainly the industry today is pointing more towards a lot more ULSD in the marine bunker business and that's the reason; it's the stability of the fuel.","Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI","Okay, thank you.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks Doug.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Market. Your line is now open.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning everyone.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Brad.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Joe, on the repurchase front. Obviously, the stock's up almost 70% over the past year. At some point, is there a change in the calculation there where some of the cash looks more attracted to M&A or maybe to the dividend or some other use rather than the repurchase, or is it truly just a flywheel for excess capital?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","No, it's the latter. And the capital allocation framework we've used now for several years just remains in place. We'll continue to invest for growth. We will continue to maintain our commitment to the dividend. And we'll use surplus cash for share repurchases.","That being said, if we saw a transaction out there that we thought was excellent and that provided synergies for the company, we wouldn't hesitate to approach it. But that's been part of the model, the framework now for several years. So I don't expect anything really to change going forward.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe, for Gary I'll ask another IMO question. Obviously, we're all consumed with all the positive potential benefits from that. Are there any offsets that you guys are thinking about, I'm particularly thinking about if industry runs (14:56) move up a lot in order to meet the distillate side of the equation, are we going to see weakness in gasoline? But any other thoughts along those lines will be helpful.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","No, I think that we're \u2013 we actually feel that IMO will be supportive of gasoline cracks as well, and the reason for that is a lot of the low-sulfur feedstocks that are going to cat crackers today to produce gasoline, you want to pull those in to make the low-sulfur marine bunker roll stack (15:23). So I think overall, IMO is very supportive to both gasoline and distillate.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks all.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning team. I just wanted to start with a big thank you to Cisko. You came into the role 15 years ago. We looked this morning, the stock is up 1,300%, over 4x the market before even looking at the dividends. We know the ride hasn't been linear, but it has been a great one and we appreciate your steady hand at the helm of a financial shift.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","So, Neal, Donna has got a high bar to jump over...","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Well, the questions I had here were all in the crude differential because you guys have unique perspective on this. And first one I'll start on the light side. So we've seen WTI Midland really widen out here in 2018, you guys have a good perspective on this, especially now with your involvement with Sunrise and with very new \u2013 a few new pipelines coming into, let's call it, the back half of 2019. There's investor concern, certainly, on the producer side that these differentials really could widen out towards trucking economics.","So I want to get your perspective on what's going on in the Midland? Is there sufficient trucks to ultimately move the crude from West Texas down from to the refining centers at Corpus Christi? Are there constraints, and how does this all kind of play out? And then I have a follow-up on the heavy side.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Hey, Neil, this is Gary. I think when you look at kind of what's happened to the Midland market over the last six months, November we had the enterprise, the Midland-to-Sealy pipeline come on with 450,000 barrels a day of takeaway capacity. As that started up, the Midland Cushing spread came in fairly narrow and then we continue to see production ramp-up, which as the production ramped up pretty much all the pipeline capacity at either Cushing or to the Gulf Coast was again being consumed.","And then in the first quarter, I think, to compound all that, you had some refinery maintenance in the Mid-Continent. And so some of the demand for some of those Midland barrels that's typically there went away and so the Midland Cushing spread really widen out. I think we see \u2013 what we see is that as refining capacity comes back on in the Mid-Continent, that Midland Cushing spread will come back in some. But as you get out later this year and early into 2019, it does look like once again production will ramp up to the point where logistics will be a limit and we'll be in for a period where that Midland Cushing spread will be relatively wide until the next pipeline project come online.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And do you have a view, Gary, in terms of how much it will cost to truck crude from West Texas down to the Gulf Cost assuming that is the marginal barrel?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","We did a little bit of that when the differential blew out several years ago, and I don't remember what the numbers are, Neil. But it's expensive to move by truck.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Great. And a follow-up question on the heavy side. We've seen this Canadian differentials tighten up here. It's going to be a big turnaround season in May and June. But production looks like it going to keep on ramping towards the end of year. So just thoughts on Western Canada? And then also LLS Maya, which has increased despite some of these Venezuela issues would be helpful.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. I'll start in Canada. Yeah, I think we saw Canadian differentials really blow out and then have since come in some. We had the Fort Hills production come online. And so increase in production you were definitely limited on the logistics to be able to clear the barrel. Some of it was the increase in production, but we also had \u2013 Keystone had a pressure restriction, which de-rated that line.","And then, a lot of issues around the rail, both weather-related issues around rail and also the lack of locomotives. So then as we moved further in the quarter, we saw some seasonal maintenance being \u2013 occurring up in Western Canada, which lowered production.","At the same time, Keystone was able to restore their capacity. We've seen some improvement in the rail. So those differentials have come back in some. But ultimately, I think, we view that production in Western Canada will outpace the ability to clear that barrel until one of the cross-border pipelines comes one, which is more a 2020 discussion. I think you'll see relatively wide discounts in Western Canada on those barrels.","At the Maya LLS, I think when you look at Maya and the Maya formula, a lot of the components of the Maya formula contributed to Maya moving weaker. WTS moved weaker. Fuel oil moved weaker. And the Brent TI are (20:10) widening out all contributed to Maya moving weaker.","And certainly, they can correct that with adjustments to the K, but what we saw in the first quarter was a lot of their demand was down due to U.S. Gulf Coast refinery maintenance. And so they were actually low in production. And within being at a position of having length I think they were reluctant to change the K. And so we saw Maya very competitively priced during the quarter.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Appreciate the insights, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","First I want to really say congratulations to Mike, and wish you a wonderful time on the retirement. But are you sure that you're so young that you want to retire? What are you going to do with all the time?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Paul. I think it's probably a little late for that. But yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Has been a fun ride for all this year that I was not following the sector as long as you have been in the sector, but has been a fun ride. So, thank you for all the help throughout the decades.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","You're welcome.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess, I have two question. First for Gary. It seems that people are talking about the IMO 2020. I'm just curious that have you guys heard anything related to the low sulfur (21:39), would that have any unexpected consequences in terms of the machine how they're going to run and all that, (21:47)?","And also that have you heard any \u2013 because I heard someone talking about a cheaper new technology may be able to directly convert the high sulfur we see into the low sulfur (21:56) bunker fuel without going through the hydrocracker or the cooking technology. Wondering if you heard anything about that. So that's the first question.","Second question then how much is the Midland crude you currently will be able to run in McKee and the rest of your system? And that \u2013 how much more that you think you may be able to get for the pipeline if said (22:22) you have any additional arrangement?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. I'll start. So, I think your first question was the impact that running a lower sulfur fuel may have on the ships' engines.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's correct.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","I think that we see a lot of the ships today when they get into these areas next to the shoreline are burning diesel anyway, and so they have some history on burning low sulfur fuels and I'm not aware of any negative impact that had on engine wear. The second part of that question in terms of technology to convert resid to low sulfur (22:56) I'll let Lane answer.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I guess our view is at grassroots was pretty expensive to do. I mean somebody had to go out and try to build something like this and just some where you have to have all the infrastructure.","So one of these looks a whole lot like maybe it's not a resid cracker but it's a resid hydro trigger, we have some experience with those. Their best use would be put into an existing refinery. I don't know if anybody is seriously looking at this at this time. I hear a lot talk about it, but I guess I'll leave it at that.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So, you are a bit skeptical about the claim that this brand \u2013 I mean, I heard someone talking about this brand-new technology may be much cheaper, a quarter of the corresponding hydrocracking solution. So just curious that you guys have any thought on that.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. I think, what I would say is skepticism is maybe overstating it a bit. I'm just saying, no matter what, it would be pretty expensive and it would have to be a refiner that would probably have to be able to do this. And I think everybody wants to \u2013 I think people want to see the market evolve before they commit that much money, particularly to a new technology that people aren't familiar with.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Very good.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Then on your Midland question, I guess all \u2013 really our capacity to run Midland is we could run as much Midland \u2013 1.6 million barrels a day of light sweet capacity we have could be all Midland. I'm sure, what you are getting at is how much of that could we get is actually priced at Midland type values.","Today, a lot of the crude we run at Ardmore and McKee is priced off of Midland. We don't divulge the number and some of the reasons for that is that pricing contracts are negotiable and up all the time, so that number flows a little bit. But we run a lot of Midland priced crude at both McKee and Ardmore.","And then, we recently announced the Sunrise project, which will give us another 100,000 barrels a day of Midland priced crude that we can take into Ardmore and McKee. And in addition to that, we're certainly looking at all these pipeline projects from the Permian to the Gulf and evaluating opportunities to get more Midland priced crude, both to our Gulf Coast system and to the export refineries.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Gary, when is Sunrise is up and running will be?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","First quarter of 2019? Yeah, first quarter of 2019.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Thank you very much.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. And Mike enjoy it. You won't have to listen to us Wall Streeters too much anymore.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. Sounds great.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I might have detected a little too much enthusiasm in that response. Hey, shifting gears a little bit here, guys, crude's been running up, wholesale price has been moving up, cracks look good. First time in several years, we're looking at retail gasoline closing in on $3. What is your thought on where we might see a demand response and kind of how do you \u2013 what experience gives you maybe that confidence?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","You know Roger, I don't know that we have an exact number. We certainly haven't seen a negative reaction to the Street price yet in terms of the demand response. And our view has always been certainly where crude got to be over $100 a barrel there was certainly demand destruction that took place there. But somewhere I think between that $80 and $100 range is when you start to see some demand destruction start to take place if crude gets that high.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","It's always muted though. I mean, if you look at what's really happened and you look at type of vehicles that are being purchased today, I think Ford has announced that they're not going to make cars \u2013 so many cars anymore. And it's because of the demand for light trucks and SUVs.","So Roger, from a practical standpoint, even with the higher price, it's going to be difficult for people to moderate their consumption that much based on the vehicles that they're buying today.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Absolutely. Just always good to get somebody who has got their hands a little closer to it than the rest of us. The other question I had, Latin America has been a nice area for margin growth, market share growth for you. I was just curious, Venezuela from a refining standpoint is, I guess, now finally shut down.","What beyond them backing out of the market have you seen in growth? In other words, what do you think is probably a true growth rate out of Latin America that we should think about maybe more from this point forward, given that I guess you'd call it a normalized activity level from refining in Latin America from this point forward?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Roger, I don't know if I can give you an absolute number. We can get with you with John to give you what that figure is. But the way we look at it is we kind of looked at a reasonable ramp-up and refinery utilization rate, and we're confident that demand growth in the region outpaces any kind of a reasonable ramp up in refinery utilization is kind of the way we've looked at that market. But in terms of absolute growth, I'm not sure I can give you a number what we've planned on.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you so much guys for taking my question. My first question is last year Pemex did approach you for possible help with fixing their assets and offered a percentage ownership. You did decline the offer. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw in those refineries because of which you decided not to go ahead with it?","And second one is I may be wrong on this, but you have a coker project at Port Arthur. Can you just add some more color about it? I'm not looking for an EBITDA guidance, but generally some specifics around the project?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. So, Manav, let's go ahead, and I'll let Lane talk a little bit about \u2013 and it's not specific just to Mexico, but it's specific to what it would take to turn around a challenged refinery, because we have tons of experience with that. So Lane, you want to share your thoughts?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. So to Joe's point, I mean really all of Latin America has some more or less exposure to the sort of having a lack of, I would say, maintenance capital. So over time their operations and their reliability have eroded, largely probably because of the flat price in crude. They can't really fund \u2013 they can't fund their operations.","And so depending on how long and how deep that sort of that story goes, it takes a long time to recover. I mean, like some conversations that we've had \u2013 some of these counterparties in the past was it's at least two turnaround cycles. And you really have to \u2013 you have to stare at your management a long time. And there's a lot of work involved in this. And a lot of times, if you think about two turnaround cycles, whether that's 6 years or 10 years, that typically out \u2013 that sort of is a longer duration than a lot of the sort of the political types or certainly the \u2013 even some of the management involved in trying to get this done.","So it's a very, very, very difficult thing to turn around a refining complex when it's gotten in states that many of these Latin American refineries are in.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","On coker.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Oh I'm sorry. (30:49) Port Arthur coker, we're still working with all the sort of the stakeholders in Port Arthur community along with the TCEQ (30:55) to get that permit move forward. We fully expect to get a permit sometime this year on it.","Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you so much guys. Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks guys. I just wanted to get your view. One of the things being proposed is making higher octane level in gasoline a standard in the U.S. and \u2013 as a potential replacement for the RFS. Just wondering if you could share your views on the merits of that proposal and any color on how it's being received by the other side, and what you think is maybe the sticking points of making it happen.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. So why don't we let Jason talk about maybe the process here a little bit. And then if Gary or Lane want to talk about what it takes, that'd be great.","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Benny, this is Jason. And you're right. That is something that's being talked about in the context of the legislative long-term reform of the RFS moving to high efficiency high octane fuel standard. And (31:59) working on this with the autos for around a year now. And the conversations have expanded recently to include the retailers in ethanol.","And we do think this will be a win all around for everybody. It helped the autos by \u2013 enable them to make more efficient vehicles. So it can hit the CAFE standards easier. It'd be a win for ethanol because ethanol is an excellent low cost source of octane. So an increased demand for ethanol. And we would all benefit making internal combustion engine more competitive longer term against (32:29). So we do think it's something that needs to be looked at.","Unknown Speaker","(32:35) gasoline blending to get there?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Well \u2013 so, this is Lane. From a gasoline blending perspective, clean high octane components like alkylate help in this process. They help dilute out some of the other sort of aromatic-based octane that are in the gasoline pool.","And like Jason alluded to, it will require a certain amount of ethanol. I mean, the industry has gotten used to ethanol in the blends and it is a source of octane. And so that definitely is going to be a part of the blend.","I think on balance, what you have to deal with is the light naphtha. Some light naphtha \u2013 assuming (33:10) are full is going to have to find its way somewhere else, whether it goes into the olefins \u2013 the olefins crackers or somewhere else, but that's a stream that we'll \u2013 that the industry will be trying to fall between high octane components to blend it off and just getting it out of the pool.","Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And do you guys have any color if ethanol or the corn side is open to this or they have any opposition?","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","This is Jason, again. I think they are still trying to get their arms around it. But the initial indications from some of the larger ethanol producers are they acknowledge kind of this 95 (33:45) type of level, or I think they call it 91 AKI, which is roughly equivalent to something that makes sense for the market.","Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Appreciate that. And just if \u2013 I have a follow-up, if I may. And apologies if you guys have touched on it in your prepared remarks. Just \u2013 is there an update on the status of the Texas City Refinery?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","So, hi Benny, this is Lane. No, we haven't said anything yet. So I think I've talked to you last \u2013 I don't know, the Friday of the Valero Texas Open, but where we are based on the repair of the alky, we're going to bring forward to the FEC (34:24) alky turnaround that we had scheduled at Texas City this past fall, we're just bringing it forward, we want to execute it now.","Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to turn the focus to the West Coast. So, this quarter you're in the black better 1Q performance than last year. And we did have some concerns in the market about West Coast operating conditions in general for the industry earlier in 1Q.","So kind of wanted to get your thoughts on outlook for the remainder of the year. Maybe, addressing where we are now versus where I think the market might have been concerned about, maybe, a month or two ago. Does it seem like a turning point from last year and a stronger starting point? So I just want to sort of get a read dynamically how we should be thinking about those for rest of the year.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes, so I think what we saw on the West Coast is certainly the inventory draw we saw this week and getting below that 30 million-barrel threshold, I think, provided a lot of support for the market. Overall, we still believe that the West Coast has long refining capacity. And so as long as all the refineries are running at high utilization rates, the market really can't absorb all the production. But when the refinery goes down, you see spikes in the market and the market becomes short.","I think longer term, the things I look to that can help that market is really the opening up and deregulation in Mexico. I think you will see exports from the West Coast that will go to the west side of Mexico. And then, you'll also see is some of the cross-border sales ramp up, in markets like El Paso you will start to see some more West Coast barrels serving the Arizona market which will help bring that market back into balance.","Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just a quick question on \u2013 I think we've talked about this earlier, about the medium sour availability being a little bit more difficult in the current environment. Just wanted to get your sense or longer term thoughts in addressing that where there might be sourcing there or is that something that we should just be sort of expecting intermediate terms to still be a little bit scarcer? And then maybe coming back next year. Want to get your read dynamics on the market.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. So I think there's not a problem really with availability of medium sour crude product system. It's just not priced to where we show an economic incentive to maximize those barrels. However they are, certainly, inter-related. And I think we see that medium sours will continue to price at a level where we wouldn't expect to run a high-volume medium sour crude until the OPEC production comes back online, whenever that is, if it is later this year or early next year. But I think if the OPEC production comes back online and you get that additional supply in the market, you will see those medium discounts widen and we'll bring them back into our system.","Prashant Rao - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Thanks very much for the time.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Prashant.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Justin Jenkins with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning everybody. I guess, I will start maybe with a corollary to Roger's gasoline question but more on the diesel front. You've got inventories as low as they've been since 2014 here in the U.S. and obviously IMO on the horizon. So if prices on diesel continue to move higher as maybe we'd all expect, does that start to impact the demand equation there and maybe even the broader economy, or how should we think about that one?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. I think we see diesel demand that's very strong. And as you mentioned, 28 million barrels below where we were last year, we had good heating oil demand with little colder weather in the Northeast. And then, we're seeing very strong rack (38:11) demand. I think some it's economic growth and then a lot of it is just the increase in the upstream activity. But the big thing to us is as we started to get out of typical heating well season you could see in the stats we actually had record exports. And we're seeing just overall what appears to be an overall global short of distillate barrels available.","So I think we feel like that the distillate market is going to be \u2013 remain very strong throughout this year, and then you certainly \u2013 as you alluded to, we'll start to see an IMO impact that affects us on the distillate side as well. When that starts to kick in, I'm not sure. But we certainly feel that we're in for a very good year in terms of the diesel fundamentals.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Appreciate that. Maybe on the midstream side. Gary, you alluded to the potential for pipeline participation towards your Gulf Coast assets. But I'm curious, Joe or even Gary, how you think about getting closer to the wellhead in the Permian to gather crude and may be control that barrel further?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. So, I think, any of these projects that come couple of reasons. One is to lower our deliver cost of crude and then also it allows us better control online, Rich Lashway and my group certainly evaluate all of them. And it's for a couple of reasons. One, is to lower our delivery cost accrued, and then also it allows us better control over the quality of the barrel that we're running in our refining system.","So for those reasons, we're involved in all these processes on the new lines coming on. And certainly look to participate if it makes sense for us to do so.","Justin S. Jenkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is now open.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Hey, guys. Good morning. Mike, I will certainly miss the opportunity to catch up with you over in West Texas. It's been a good run and congrats to you man.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Blake.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","I wanted to go back. I know you've kind of addressed, Gary, some of the, I guess, the mediums and likes, but a lot of the inbound questions we've been getting from clients recently has been on where we stand with regard to maxing out light sweet processing.","I think you had mentioned to me last week that you're backing out mediums and going to max light sweet and heavy, but can you say \u2013 I mean, have you fully exhausted your capability of running light sweet at this point?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Pretty much, Blake. If you look at where we were in the first quarter, we said that we ended at 1.6 million barrels a day of light sweet crude processing capacity. Although it wasn't fully utilized, a lot of the capacity that wasn't used, it was because we had maintenance going on at a couple of our refineries that backed out some of that light sweet crude processing capacity. But we pretty much \u2013 our economic signals are pointing us to maximize light sweet pretty much everywhere we can.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Okay. The second question, your utilization rates along with the industry have been pretty well above what historical norms would suggest and above expectations. And I'm just curious if you have any thoughts around, maybe, what's driving that and the sustainability of that. Is that just kind of capacity creep maybe to where the nameplate numbers are a little bit stale, or is just reliability improving, or any thoughts you have there?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","I think when I go back and look at the trend in refinery utilization, some of it is tied to the trend in running lighter crude. So as the API \u2013 average API gravity of the crude slate has gone up throughout the industry, utilization has gone up with it. So we certainly see at some of our refineries, as we run a lighter diet, it enables us to run higher rates. So with that, you would expect that as the crude quality discounts widen and the slate gets heavier, maybe there's a chance utilization falls back off if that occurs.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Hey \u2013 hey, Blake, I'll just add one other thing. I think one of the things you've seen over the last few years is different than maybe historically. So there's been a call on crude capacity signals, that's pretty much been the most economic unit in the refinery. So all refiners will do everything to make sure that capacity is always well utilized, feedstocks were in front of it. You might even incur demurrage to make sure that in fact you don't lose capacity.","So, I mean, that's clearly been part of what's going on with respect to the utilization, because that number is the crude unit capacity. It's not buying intermediates and other things.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Blake.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First one is just on LLS discounts to Brent. We started to see those widen out a bit here this year, starting to creep higher towards the Houston side. And I presume some of that's DAPL and Diamond and the knock on effects. But just curious how you think about LLS discounts moving towards say relative to Houston?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Phil. I think to some degree, we're starting to view LLS as somewhat of a stranded crude marker. I think especially since we exited that market. When we started at the Diamond Pipeline, there's just not a lot of liquidity around LLS anymore. And so to us, the more relevant marker to look for the U.S. Gulf Coast light sweet is that MEH (43:24) marker. And that's the one we tend to look at more heavily than LLS.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. That makes sense. The second question is just around the California refining market. I want to get your latest thoughts on Wilmington and the hydrofluoric acid phase-out discussions. I know there's a committee meeting coming up this weekend. There are some slides published in advance of that meeting, talking about potentially phasing out HFA altogether, which I know would be a fairly costly endeavor. So I just want to get your viewpoint on this HFA phase out, particularly given the cost relative to the size of the refinery.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes. This is Lane. Hey. We just really continue to work with the community and the SCAQMD out there and then the other stakeholders really to arrive at what we think will ultimately be a reasonable solution. That's sort of what we've been stating in all the calls and all the conferences and that still what we believe.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So just to clarify, I mean, you wouldn't at this point say a phase out of HFA would be a nonstarter for you guys?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Say that again?","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","The idea that HFA would be phased out for sulfuric or some other solution, is that a non-starter from a cost perspective?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","It, well \u2013 it would absolutely \u2013 we're building an alkylation unit at our Houston refinery and at our St. Charles. And so you're talking about something on the order of $0.5 billion. If in fact we build the sulfuric acid and then that would be in California, so it would be probably even more. So it'll be a very, very, very expensive endeavor, if there was a short fuse on a phase-out in the West Coast.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. This is Clay (45:20) on for Doug. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of things have been touched here. So I just want to get your thoughts on Latin America. Obviously, the underperformance in that refining system has played a big role in creating the opportunity to ramp U.S. product exports. Just want to know what the prognosis is today, and if there are any upside risk to crude runs that you guys are watching out for.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","I don't think we see anything that causes us a pause for what we're doing in Latin America. We still see very good product demand pools (45:50) both for gasoline and distillate. I don't think we see anything on the horizon that's going to change that.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thanks guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Maybe a follow-up question. You addressed your view on overall kind of Canadian heavy and heavy differentials earlier. But can you talk about within your system and how much Canadian heavy are you able to run right now? What are the \u2013 I realize it's going to be difficult until the cross-border pipelines potentially in 2020, but are there any \u2013 is there any possibility of you being able to increase your heavy crude runs over the next couple years? And maybe are you seeing any impacts from falling Venezuelan volumes or have you still had a strong heavy availability in the Gulf?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. So in the quarter, we ran about 180,000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian, Ryan, and it's not really a limit in our system. It's more of an economic optimization. So we could run a lot more heavy Canadian if the economic signals pointed us in that direction. But it would be at the expense of some of the other Latin American grades, be it Venezuelan or Maya. Some of those grades we would push out if the Canadian was more economic.","Follow-up, I guess, in Venezuela, we've certainly seen some issues with production and issues around logistics. But for the most part, the volumes we got for Venezuela in the first quarter were consistent with what our historical volumes have been. And we continue to see good value for those barrels versus our other heavy sour alternatives.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And maybe one follow-up on \u2013 it feels like we've talked about Latin America a lot today. But there is \u2013 Petrobras is obviously looking for partners into (47:51) some opening up of the markets there and partnerships in some of the refineries down there. Do you view that as a similar situation of what you're describing earlier with Pemex, or how do you view the potential opportunities out of the Brazilian market?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, this is Joe. I mean, we'll take a look. I think it's too early for us to answer your question as specifically as you asked it though. I mean, we just don't know yet. So I mean, just like many others I'm sure we'll just take a look and see what the opportunity looks like and see what we can do with it. And then, we'll let you know more about it later.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Joe.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning everyone. Maybe to circle back. I think it was Lane's comment, talking about how the crude tower has pretty much been the most economical part of the refinery today. So just looking at your Gulf Coast system, you've run about 1.44 (48:53) of crude, but you produce 1.84 (48:57) of products, even after the recent crude topper projects at Corpus and Houston. Is there any thought to adding more crude distillation capacity on the Gulf Coast? And what kind of economics are you seeing on those recent topper projects?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, this is Lane, again. The issue you have \u2013 there's a limit to how much you can run crude because at some point \u2013 or even build it out. When we put our two crude toppers on, we sized them such that they would match our downstream capability, particularly in diesel hydrotreating, so we wouldn't have to go out and try to market something that didn't meet the ULSD spec.","And so I think when many people look at a crude unit project, they're going to have to \u2013 there's other units involved. We were \u2013 and the reason we were able to do that is because we were buying a number of intermediate feedstocks in lieu of crude. So that set the size. For us to go up a lot more in that space, we would have to invest in diesel hydrotreating and gasoline hydrotreating. What was the second part of your question?","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","What kind of returns are you seeing on the Corpus and Houston toppers?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","(50:13) can give you the specifics, they have been great projects. They've exceeded our funding decisions with respect to IRR. So They've been great projects for us.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. Seems like it. Second question is on product exports. So you reported 271,000 barrels per day of product exports. I think that was down quite a bit year-over-year. Was that due to higher ethanol blends in Brazil this year? And can you also provide a split between how much was gasoline and how much was diesel?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes. So we start with that. We did 73,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports and our diesel exports were 163,000 barrels a day. The year-over-year numbers are down fairly significantly, and there's a number of reasons for that. Joe alluded to weather issues in the Gulf, especially a lot of fog that prohibited us from exporting during the quarter. Also we had some refinery maintenance that limited production.","But the biggest thing was really probably more the strength of the U.S. market. So we have the ability to put barrels on the water and for us during the quarter we actually saw a lot better value to take those barrels we're putting on the water to the Florida market, for instance, rather than the export market. So a lot of our dock capacity was consumed taking barrels like to the Florida market, waterborne markets in the U.S. rather than the export market.","I don't think it's any indication of lack of demand it was just \u2013 we always view that as an economic optimization and we had better netbacks to send to other markets.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, Craig.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I understand there is not really a governor or upper limit on share price as far as buyback considerations. But is there an upper limit of the cash holdings that could impact targeted payouts if attractive M&A really doesn't materialize over the next two to three years?","And as a follow-up to that, can you opine on what you might see long-term in terms of industry consolidation in midstream versus refining?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay, Mike, do you want to do the first one?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I mean, we continue to evaluate the cash flow uses and the allocation of the surplus cash flow. That has not changed. We continue to allocate it per capital allocation framework. Right now, our payout ratio is 40% to 50%. If cash were built significantly over the next several quarters, surely, we would have to look at that to see whether we need to adjust that payout ratio in absence of any type of M&A opportunity.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay, and Craig, on the second part of your question, it was the consolidation, whether it would be in refining or MLPs?","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","And which might come earlier, right.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, okay, this is purely an opinion, right. And I open it up to any members of the team if they want to comment also. But I just don't think there's going to be a significant amount of opportunity for consolidation on the refining side of the business from Valero's perspective, because we really like our portfolio today. We have an excellent portfolio. I mean, there's things that we could bolt onto it that would be nice to have. But as far as creating \u2013 needing to do a transaction to create a lot more critical mass, that's just not something that we need to do today.","So opportunistically, we look at everything, but practically speaking, we don't feel we need to do anything. Now, could there be more consolidation? Sure. I think people are always looking for different ways to grow their businesses. And certainly, if you can create synergy by combining, it makes a lot of sense to do that. In the MLP space, I don't know. Rich, do you have a view?","Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.","I would say that it would be a challenge to think of consolidation right now in the \u2013 the MLP market is everybody's kind of reassessing the access to the equity capital market. So it doesn't seem like that there would be a momentum for that to happen right now to let equity capital markets kind of gets figured out.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. I mean, that all makes sense. It just sounds like eventually the payout ratio is going to have to rise over time.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Oh yeah, well, the ratio might rise, but probably the target is going to stay somewhat consistent. You know the volatility that we historically had in this business, which we have done our best as a team to try to strip. And so you always want to be careful with the dividend and be sure that once you put it in place, that is our commitment to our owners and we're going to be sure we do everything we can to sustain that dividend.","And so Mike \u2013 we don't have a particular targeted number because Mike and Donna always look at the forecasted cash, what the balances look like going forward. And we've told the market for several years now we're not going to hoard cash and we haven't. And so I think, Craig, you should just assume that if we find ourselves sitting on a pot full of cash that we're going to return it.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the thoughts.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's Q&A session. And I'd like to return the call to Mr. John Locke for any closing remarks.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. Well, thanks, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Feel free to give the IR team a call if you have any additional questions.

My name is Sylvia, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to John Locke. John Locke, you may begin.","John Locke","Thank you, Sylvia. Good morning. Welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our CEO and President; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","Now, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC.","As noted in the release, we reported second quarter 2014 earnings from continuing operations of $651 million or $1.22 per share. For all period shown in the table that accompany the earnings release, our results of operations reflect our Aruba Refinery as discontinued operations and we recognize $63 million of charges in the second quarter of 2014 associated with the recording asset retirement and other obligations related to our Aruba Refinery.","Second quarter 2014 operating income improved over second quarter 2013 with gains in the refining in ethanol segments partly offset by a decrease in the retail segment due to the spin-off CST brand in May 2013.","The refine segment throughput margin in the second quarter of 2014 was $9.84 per barrel, which is an increase of $0.58 per barrel versus the second quarter of 2013. Decreases in gasoline and distillate margins relative to Brent in most regions and narrower WTI discounts in the Mid-Continent relevant -- relative to Brent were more than offset by wider discounts on light sweet medium sour and heavy crude oil in the Gulf Coast.","Also contributing to the higher throughput margin was our Quebec City refinery\u2019s increased consumption of North American light crude in the second quarter. North American grades composed 83% of the refinery\u2019s feedstock diet, up from 45% in the first quarter of 2014 and up from 8% in the second quarter of 2013. Additionally, at our St. Charles refinery we have began processing Canadian bitumen by our new crude-by-rail unloading facility.","The U.S. crude supply landscape continue to transition in the second quarter with oil stock shifting from the Mid-Continent to the Gulf Coast, the inventory reduction in Cushing and corresponding oil supply growth in the Gulf Coast led to a $2.49 per barrel decline in the WTI discount to Brent and $5.19 per barrel increase in the LLS discount to Brent compared to the second quarter of 2013.","Gulf Coast sour crude oil differentials to Brent also widened over the same time period due to increase in supply of crude oil. The discounts for Mars and Maya relative to Brent increased by $4.69 per barrel and $8.49 per barrel, respectively.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.7 million barrels per day in the second quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 115,000 barrels per day versus the second quarter of 2013.","Less turnaround activity and higher utilization rates spurred by the increase availability of discounted North American light crude in the Gulf Coast led to the increase in refining throughput volumes.","Refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter of 2014 were $3.90 per barrel, which is $0.07 per barrel greater than the second quarter of 2013, due mainly to higher energy costs.","The ethanol segment generated $187 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2014 versus $95 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2013. The increase in operating income was mainly due to a $0.39 per gallon increase gross margin which was driven by lower corn prices on an abundant corn crop and low industry ethanol inventories at the start of the quarter.","Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.3 million gallons per day in the second quarter of 2014, which were lower than the second quarter of 2013 due to production slowdown caused by lingering rail congestion in the Mid-Continent.","Now looking at the third quarter for ethanol, we expect volumes to increase with the startup of our recently acquired plan in Mount Vernon, Indiana, given the favorable ethanol margin environment we look forward to this plant\u2019s contributions.","General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $170 million in the second quarter of 2014. Net interest expense was $98 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $414 million. The effective tax rate was 34.3%.","Now with respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $6.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $3.5 billion of which $382 million was held by Valero Energy Partners.","Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 14.1% excluding cash held by Valero Energy Partners. Valero had approximately $5.8 billion and Valero Energy Partners had $300 million of available liquidity in addition to cash.","Cash flows in the second quarter included $806 million of capital expenditures of which $240 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. We also repaid $200 million of debt that matured in April.","In the second quarter we return $361 million in cash to our shareholders, which included $133 million in dividend payments and $228 million in purchasing of approximately $4 million shares of Valero common stock.","Subsequent to the second quarter, we continue to return cash to stockholders by purchasing an additional 2.0 million share of common stock for $104 million. We also increased our regular quarterly dividend for the third of 2014 by $2.05 per share to $27.05 per share or $1.10 per share annualized.","Also in the second quarter we announced the sale of the McKee crude system, the Three Rivers crude system and the Wynnewood Products system to Valero Energy Partners for $154 million. This transaction closed on July 1st and as an example of executing our strategy to create stockholder value to Valero Energy Partners.","For 2014, we maintained our guidance for capital expenditures including turnarounds and catalyst at approximately $3 billion. We expect stay-in business capital to account for slightly under 50% of total spending and for the reminder to be allocated to strategic growth investments, primarily for logistics and advantage crude oil processing capability.","I should add that approximately $870 million of Valero\u2019s estimated strategic capital spent for 2014 is all logistics and most of this is expected to be eligible for dropdown into Valero Energy Partners.","Now for modeling, our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges, Gulf Coast at 1.45 million to 1.55 million barrels per day, Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day.","We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be around $4 per barrel. For our ethanol operations in the third quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.6 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization.","We expect G&A expense excluding depreciation for the third quarter to be around $165 million and net interest expense should be about $95 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the third quarter should be approximately $420 million and our effective tax rate should be around 35%.","Okay. So we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we\u2019ll open the call to questions. During the segment we request that our callers limit each turn to two questions. They may rejoin the queue with additional questions after that.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons","Good morning.","John Locke","Good morning, Jeff","Joe Gorder","Good morning, Jeff","Jeff Dietert - Simmons","I was hoping to hit on capital spending? You stand consistent with your $3 billion forecast for 2014. I was curious as you look forward continues to be an opportunity rich environment in your view more light processing, more logistics, perhaps on the logistics side do you see that as a steady trend or trend that accelerating as far as logistics investment opportunities?","","Joe Gorder","Hey. Good morning, Jeff. This is Joe. Yeah. I\u2019d say you raise a very good point. I mean, if you look at it broadly, we are going to maintain a very balanced approach with the use of cash returning it to shareholders via the dividends and buybacks.","And then, investing to maintain the quality assets, which is, just a core part of our capital programs and then we are also investing to take advantages, natural resources advantage were enjoyed.","Relative to the investment in logistics asset, I think what you would see now is a bit of shift in capital -- in the strategic capital from -- for example, we shift some of the spending for the purposed methanol plant for 2015 and we move the crude by rail facility up into 2014. So as the percentage, I think, that we have now is 54% of our strategy capital now is focused on logistics, where as previously, Jeff, is in the 40s. So the point that you make is one that we clearly agree with and recognize and so we\u2019ve seen a shift in that capital.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons","Secondly, could you talk a little bit about your historical capital investment and what types of returns you\u2019re seeing so far from some of those investment, maybe hit on the hydrocracker investments at Port Arthur and St. Charles? What kind of returns are you seeing there based on their performance to date?","Joe Gorder","Jay, go ahead.","Jay Browning","Long time, yeah.","Joe Gorder","Yeah. Jeff, I\u2019ll tell you what, you asked a question and I think you recognized that it\u2019s very difficult to look at unit within the refining complex and determine specifically what\u2019s the return to that is, because of all the interrelationship in the plant.","I think we\u2019ve said in the past and we would continue to say that the hydrocracker project were very good investments. Project -- the units are running very well and Lane can speak to that and the projects that we are getting out of units are good, high-quality diesel fuel that we are able to export as EN 590 grades versus a conventional diesel fuel.","So, although, I don\u2019t have a specific return on hydrocracker project per se for you, I\u2019ll tell you we are pleased with the investment. We think they have improved the quality of the portfolio and they are performing very well.","Lane Riggs","Jeff, this is Lane. They\u2019ve averaged 120,000 combine units averaged 120,000 barrels in the second quarter. They\u2019ve definitely earned very well. These are great units. We are currently in the process of performing a test run at our St. Charles Refinery. It\u2019s I don\u2019t want to. I would be careful not to say what they are, where we are on that. But it certainly allows us to look at a very limited opportunistic capital investment. Those units are really bring them up to essentially all about the equipment and the sizes. But they\u2019ve ramped fantastically in the second quarter.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons","Thanks, guys.","Joe Gorder","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","And your next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Hey, guys. Two questions, Joe, I joined a little bit late, maybe you already covered it. Do you have a preliminary CapEx outlook for 2015 and \u201816?","Joe Gorder","Yeah. No, Paul, we don\u2019t and I\u2019ll tell what, what we are doing right now is we are going through the strategic planning process here at Valero and part of that, obviously, is the review of any kind of growth project we might be looking forward to in the 2015, in addition to what we got base loaded. We are spending $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion a year on maintenance reliability turnaround.","So, that is going to continue and be fundamentally part of what we\u2019re doing. But we haven\u2019t settled in on the projects, the growth projects we want to carry forward those and we continue to pursue the crude units, we continue to look at the methanol plant. And then as you would expect there is host of logistic projects that we are evaluating. But we haven\u2019t settled in on the number, yet.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Do you have settled into a direction at least this year is three, are we talking about -- from a direction standpoint flat, up or down?","Joe Gorder","Yeah. Paul, it won\u2019t be up.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Okay. The second question that, do you have an estimated downtime cost in the second quarter in terms of the actual incremental cost and also that if you can give it, if you have it, would be helpful that for two number, one is the actual incremental cost and the second one is the opportunity cost that you lost?","Lane Riggs","Hi Paul. This is Lane. So our unscheduled downtime cost in the second quarter was $103 million.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","$103 million. And that\u2019s pretax or after-tax earning?","Lane Riggs","That\u2019s really EBITDA.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","And you say, that\u2019s opportunity cost or it\u2019s actual cost? I\u2019m sorry.","Lane Riggs","That is what we would call our volume variance which is if the units would\u2019ve performed the way we had planned than they would have generated another $103 million.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Right. So that\u2019s the opportunity cost?","Lane Riggs","Yes.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","And how about actual incremental cost. Because I presume that you probably have some because of all the downtime, you have some additional maintenance cost and all that\u2026","Lane Riggs","Yeah. I\u2019m not -- it\u2019s really that's embedded inside our performance. We\u2019d have to get back with you on that exact number.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Okay. Will do. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Hi. Good morning everybody.","Joe Gorder","Good morning Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Guys, your throughputs in the quarter beat your guidance in every region. And you've effectively raised your guidance for 3Q to be more in-line with the better performance in Q2. Could you talk a little bit more about the dynamics of how you're coming in so much higher? Really, within weeks and months of having set the guidance, you're coming in about 10% plus higher, in terms of throughputs. Could you just talk a bit more about, firstly, the technicalities of that? Secondly, the implications? And thirdly, where we might go, given the CapEx you've highlighted this year for presenting yet more light sweet? Thanks.","Ashley Smith","Okay. So Paul, this is Ashley. On actual runs, throughput runs versus guidance, guidance is -- it\u2019s a conservative estimate based on planned downtime and turn around, things like that. And I think what you can do is run some -- get some throughput. It might be lower margin throughput because you\u2019re buying higher-price intermediates or other feedstocks to keep downstream units going. Generally that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see delta.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","So, it's not a function of you running more light sweet and, therefore, pushing more crude through the refineries?","Ashley Smith","No. I think we generally planned to run the amount of lights that we expected. It more has to do with planned downtime.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Okay. So actually, what you're pretty clearly saying is, the better performance is simply due to a conservative guidance that you beat?","Ashley Smith","Because of relatively heavy planned turnaround activity.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Right. The final part of my question was, does your current CapEx program expand the capacity or is it a shift mix entirely?","Joe Gorder","Paul, we\u2019ll let Lane talk about the crude units and what the impact will be.","Lane Riggs","Yeah. So Paul, this is Lane Riggs. So again we have our two announced crude units, one at Corpus Christi and one at Houston with the combined capacity of incremental suite capability of about around 160,000 barrels a day. And then we\u2019ll finish McKee which is an incremental 25 a day next year. Those are really the planned expansion on light sweet product capability.","So with that said, we still are learning limits of our system on how much light sweet crude we can run, particularly on a Gulf Coast where it\u2019s available. And we\u2019re not really -- we still optimize those crude into our system versus our alternative medium sour, heavy sour, Canadian heavy and all these other. So we still have -- we can feel optimize and run more if the economics signals are there.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","The final part of this whole question is for me to ask you, in the past, you said that you need a 10% light heavy differential to run a (indiscernible) I think, was the guidance. Do you have a sense the -- you talked about the sensitivities. Can you give us a sense for what the price differentials need to be to be running, more or less? Yeah, on lights, on lights?","Lane Riggs","So you are saying -- Paul, this is Lane. So you are saying that we\u2019ve given guidance in the past that we need a light heavy differential of 10% versus\u2026.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Yes. Kind of a rule of thumb for what causes you to run more light sweet in a mix against, for example, a medium sour.","Joe Gorder","To back out heavy and run.","Lane Riggs","Yeah, back out heavy and run sweet. It\u2019s probably fair somewhere in that number. Today we definitely have incentive to run all three et cetera. And they all have slightly a pretty similar margins into our crude capacity and\/or into an open (indiscernible). So I think today, if you would look at, they are very reflective of what these -- what the relative values in refineries are.","Joe Gorder","13% off of rig. Right, so it\u2019s in that general range. It still would trickle to run the heavy solid crudes versus pushing more light sweet into the plant.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Okay, guys. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company","Good morning. I'll just touch on the condensate export issue. It seems like it's come into flux a little bit over the past couple days. I was wondering, as we await the BIS public guidance, as far as what the requirements will be in processing, if you have identified any opportunities at Corpus Christi, maybe either on the midstream side or sourced at the VLO level for that kind of processing capacity? Where you can kind of lean into some regulatory shifts that might nominally work against you but with VLP, could actually become the revenue margin driver over time?","Joe Gorder","Well, Sam, we look at these projects all the time. Right now, we don\u2019t have a condensate splitter project on the board. We\u2019re very focused on the two crude units that we talked about and really nothing beyond that at this point in time.","Lane Riggs","So Sam, this is Lane. I\u2019ll follow-up a little bit. The two crude units that we have designed, have a designed API gravity of 50. So these two crude units are fairly long although we would say the equipment is necessary to run a pretty light diet. We could run condensate and this is going to be a matter of again, what the economic signals and how distressed it is.","In our economics, we had LLS and Brent parity. And we had to export naphtha out of U.S. Gulf Coast close to Far East. So that stream whether it\u2019s condensate, it\u2019s naphtha, whatever form it takes, it\u2019s got to find the market whether it\u2019s western Europe or the Far East, that sort of -- the value of naphtha is in the value of these condensates. It\u2019s still -- it will be interesting to see how that goes.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company","Okay. Even if they are taking up to 50, they'll still produce some BGO for the hydrocrackers and some of the other downstream units too?","Lane Riggs","Yes, it\u2019s not as much, right, because it\u2019s lighter.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company","Okay.","Lane Riggs","And that will be included in our economic because our alternative would be the intermediate to fill out of conversion units.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company","Okay, thanks. And I just wanted to touch on differentials in the Gulf, too. There has been a lot of volatility. I think last year when LLS spiked to that Brent premium briefly in July and August, you guys had highlighted the fact that some barrels were coming in on Longhorn offspec and the spot market for LLS and in Houston got very tight because of that. Is there any single piece of infrastructure development that we can be mindful of here over the last couple of weeks, aside from just very high utilization in the Gulf, maybe the delay in BridgeTex or something of that nature that might explain that LLS pop a couple of weeks ago?","Joe Gorder","Sam, this is Joe. Randy Hawkins is with us reporting and Randy is our Senior Vice President of Crude and Feedstocks Supply and he will be able to answer that for you.","Randy Hawkins","I think you touched on it already -- the high utilization rate that kind of led to some of the spike that we saw in LLS at the end of the August trade month. But I think you hit on the nose. The thing that we are looking ahead is the BridgeTex startup that we are anticipating at sometime late Q3 that will bring some of this distressed midland type barrels to the Gulf Coast that should help to provide some of the barrels that the Gulf Coast needs.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company","Okay, great. I think it's delayed, right? Is there some planned barrels or something that people are missing, and sort of a spot market issue, maybe?","Joe Gorder","Yeah, I mean, I think there were some -- maybe some people that were anticipating BridgeTex being a bit earlier and I think overall the high run rate, people were just a bit short and falling inventories as well led to that.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Company","All right. Thank you so much.","Operator","And the next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez -Howard Weil","Guys good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had two for you. One bigger picture and one more specific. But the big picture, Joe, as you kind of transition into your new role, I'm just curious if there is any low-hanging fruit or any strategic shifts that you see on the radar screen that you really want to address out of the gate?","Joe Gorder","Blake, good morning. I mean that\u2019s a fair question but quite honestly I think that this management team that\u2019s in the room today has been working with Bill for a long time and the plans that we put in place are plans that we are all very comfortable with. And so if you look at what we have got on the burner with the crude units and the logistics investment and then you look at some of the projects that are being contemplated like the methanol plan. These are all projects. This team feels pretty good about and that we are continuing to advance the conversations around.","So from an investment perspective there isn\u2019t. From a use of cash perspective, we have maintained for sometime now that we are going to try to maintain a balanced program between investment and capital projects for growth and return of cash to shareholders. And I think we are going to continue to do that. I mean very clearly the fact now that we have had our second dividend increase this year which support the fact that we are permitted to increasing the cash returns to shareholders. And then today we bought back about 10.4 million shares and we will continue to do that throughout the year as cash flow is available to do it.","So I would say there is no major shifts right now. The ox cart is not in the ditch. And as I mentioned earlier we are going through the process of pulling together our strategic plan for the next several years including and that will be capital plan. So I think we are in a pretty good position.","Blake Fernandez -Howard Weil","All right. That\u2019s great. The second question, I hope this is one question, but you runs up at Quebec of North America crude hit at 83%. I was hoping if you can give us a breakdown of how much of that has been barge from Gulf Coast and how much is actually tied I guess from Canada? And then I guess similarly on the rail to St Charles, just trying to understand should we be thinking about the economics on that as far as once you pay for transport. Is that kind of competitive with Maya or even more competitive just kind of some general feel about how we should be thinking about the margin impact there? Thanks.","Randy Hawkins","Blake, this is Randy Hawkins again. At Quebec the split of our North American crude was around 58 days by rail and about 1 00 a day shifts from the US Gulf Coast and two Quebec. Could you repeat the question on the Canadian?","Blake Fernandez -Howard Weil","Yes. Basically it looks like you started railing bitumen into St. Charles and I guess that is kind of view that as competing maybe with Maya and I didn\u2019t know by the time you pay for transport to rail it down from Canada if we should be viewing that as if more competitive. In other words, discounted to which you could access Maya at or at par?","Randy Hawkins","Yes, I would say that we\u2019re railing from Canada would be on par or better than Maya. The volumes for Q2 are fairly small. We anticipate this increase as we move into Q3.","Joe Gorder","Yes, Blake the refinery was moving turn around in the internally around in second quarter, so we aren\u2019t going to see the impact of any of those that bitumen movement until the third quarter.","Blake Fernandez -Howard Weil","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And the next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Good morning, it\u2019s Faisel from Citi. Just had a question to follow-up on Blake's question on Canadian heavy. So I guess with the rail capacity at St. Charles and even some of your other facilities, and then with the connection to Keystone from Port Arthur, how much Canadian heavy do you guys envision having the ability to access by the end of the year? And then how are you thinking of that, versus your term contracts with PEMEX. Is there flexibility? Just sort of arbitrage those barrels between each other?","Randy Hawkins","Sure. Faisel, this is Randy Hawkins again. On our Canadian volume, we do anticipate with our rail facility in Lucas coming up later in the year that we will increase the amount of rail that we are taking into our production facility. We also buy regularly Canadian heavy after the pipeline systems coming out of cushion as well. So right now we don\u2019t anticipate that impacting our volumes with Mexico and it more is backing out some of the spot heavy that we are doing elsewhere from around the region.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. And just how much sort of capacity for Canadian heavy do you think you guys will have the ability to sort of run by the end of the period what always pipelihe and real capacity?","Joe Gorder","I think for now we are limited logistics more so than we find the configuration .","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay, fair enough. And just my question it\u2019s on the changes in the rail regulations, have you see from the DoT and also the Canadian regulators. Is that going to have any impact of sort of the volumes you guys are moving around your system by rail?","Joe Gorder","Faisel, I think we are all waiting to see what those regulations settling in at and if you look at the things that are being proposed with the shell thickness in the (indiscernible) protection systems, the breaking systems. There is going to be a lot of retrofitting activity and modifications to already planned cars that has to take place and frankly the fleet, the rail fleet is in service today, it\u2019s very large and depending on the timeline for retrofit, it\u2019s going to have an affect on rail movement just in general.","So we don\u2019t have a good estimate as to what the overall impact is going to be. We are in the process of working this year or so specifically working with ASP and formulating response to DOT and to transport Canada\u2019s proposal, but its probably just a little bit early for us to give you any idea as to what the impact might be.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay. Understood. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Jason Smith - Bank of America","Hey, guys. It's actually Jason Smith, on for Doug. If we could touch on throughput from the product side. With you guys and industry seemingly running at a higher overall level and in the release, I think you highlighted product prices versus Brent. Can you talk about what the implications of a self-sufficient U.S. system are, particularly on gasoline, where I think we're exporting as much as we're importing, at this point?","Joe Gorder","All right. So we\u2019re kind of looking at each other, trying to figure out exactly what it is you that you\u2019re trying to understand. Are you saying, at what utilization rates do we satisfy U.S. demand?","Jason Smith - Bank of America","No. I'm trying to say, I mean, we've basically seen, we've talked about product prices, pricing off Brent. But is there -- as we become more self-sufficient on the gasoline side, is there risk? Do we potentially price off of LLS?","Joe Gorder","I see.","Jason Smith - Bank of America","How do you see that playing out? We're producing 9.5 million a day of gasoline today. We're exporting as much as we're importing. ","Joe Gorder","Right. That\u2019s an interesting question. Why don\u2019t we let -- Scott Lively is with us today and he is our Senior Vice President of Products, Supply and Trading. Maybe he can just give you some thoughts on that.","Scott Lively","Hey Doug, how are you doing?","Jason Smith - Bank of America","Good.","Scott Lively","I guess, the way that I think about it, I don\u2019t think about necessarily what price products have to price off of as a feedstock. I just think, you\u2019ve got prices that are around the globe and we have to compete. And so barrels either arb into those markets or did not arb into those markets. And so you can say, we priced against Brent or we priced against something else.","Well, we\u2019re running a lot more WTI based crudes in the Gulf Coast. So that region sees more of a WTI like margin whereas, something on the East Coast of New York refinery say, might price more against West African, Canadian that moves eastward. So I think you\u2019re going to see pockets, the differentiation based on what crude types people run. But I don\u2019t get it but I necessarily think about the way that you\u2019re trying to describe with pricing against brand specifically or WTI specifically.","Joe Gorder","We do talk about the incremental barrel into a refiner being a light sweet water borne barrel, which should be kind of a Brent type barrel, as long as that\u2019s the incremental barrel, you\u2019re going to be pricing products off of Brent.","Scott Lively","You have to get rid of all the gasoline production in those marginal refineries, which -- that\u2019s a lot of European and African and South American refineries. Those would have to be backed down, shut down before your price in the marginal barrel off of LLS or WTI and that significant amount, so those are the price pattern. Yes, you going to have times where U.S., low quality gasoline in the winter going to trade cheaper than it does in summer, you always have seasonality. But the marginal barrel is still going to be pricing out of the U.S. that\u2019s going to set the prices.","Jason Smith - Bank of America","Got it. How is the shift to a lighter crude slate and how is that impacting your gasoline yield? Are you seeing more gasoline out of that crude, at this point? ","Lane Riggs","Hey, this is Lane. And now we\u2019re pretty much still running, making almost within the noise of our systems, the same amount of gasoline that we were. And because of flexibility in the system and how we can change in points, whether we made naphtha or gasoline or just a lot of optimization points that we still have.","Jason Smith - Bank of America","Got it. My follow-up is on the West Coast. One of your peers recently announced a petrochem feedstock project. Are there any opportunities for projects like that within your portfolio? And also, if you could, maybe, give us an update on the Benicia rail project and where that stands right now?","Lane Riggs","Okay. This is Lane again, all start with the Benicia rail project. It\u2019s currently in the -- DEIR is out during the comment period, we close on that. The comment period will close September 15. We\u2019re still confident that we will get a permit, of course we\u2019ll hope -- we'll, certainly along the city of Benicia will help to help answer all the question that come out of DEIR.","On the first point, we are looking at a lot of projects to the ones that you\u2019re talking about. And I think we\u2019re fairly skeptical. It would be tough to get permits. I think at the end of day, we take a while to build the project and get permit push through with quite an effort, as you can see with the crude-by-rail project on the West Coast.","Jason Smith - Bank of America","Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","And then next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Hello, Good morning.","Joe Gorder","Good morning, Roger.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Well, I guess, I wanted to ask a little bit about the export market, what you see for volumes as we head into the fourth quarter. Traditionally, the strongest part of the year. And if you could give us a recap of what you've seen in the diesel market year-to-date. If we looked at where the futures were a year ago versus what we realized, margins came in a lot lower and I'm just speaking from a general or generic term.","Can you kind of walk us through what you are seeing out there in the diesel market, both domestically and on the export side? And whether or not that has any particular concerns, as we look to the end of the year?","Scott Lively","Hi, Roger. This is Scott again. Over the quarter, we exported 210 a day of diesel and I would say, that\u2019s pretty flat with where we were on 1Q. We still see continued global demand growth in that fuel. So we feel pretty positive about our ability to export number one and having those markets to export into number two.","You did have a little bit of hangover effect of the mild winter that Europe had, which really, particularly kept German stocks from drawing down. But those stocks are coming back more in line and those guys look like they are going to need to be building going into the winter. So we fully expected these export rates that we\u2019ve had to continue out in the 3Q and 4Q.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then, something that got beat up on last year. We keep waiting for the EPA to give us the official numbers. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in the RINs market? We all know where the prices are. But what you've been doing about buying RINs, what your plans are if they make changes, presumably, an upwards revision to the ethanol and other biofuel requirements, as has been rumored in the press. As we, maybe, get something next month. Certainly hope to see something by the October, November period?","Scott Lively","Well, we do of course, keep our eye on the markets and we are participants. I think it probably put me at a competitive disadvantage if I said exactly what we were doing and what I planned on doing if we got an idea that they were actually going to raise too or above the blend wall as Podesta and potentially, Gina MacCarthy have alluded to.","I think we just have to sit back just like everyone else and wait for them to come out with the final decision on what the obligation is gong to be. And hopefully at sooner rather than later because obviously as the time horizon shrinks that shrinks the time horizon for you to be able to go out there and procure the RINs that you\u2019re obligated to in arrears.","Joe Gorder","Yeah. I think the one thing that we do have going right now though is that there is probably as much ethanol being blended into the gasoline fuel. This could possibly be blended and as a result supply of RIN is there. So the economics are supporting it and the ethanol market in general, this is favorable to blend.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Right. Unfortunately, it's not always an economic driven story, where RINs are concerned and ethanol. I guess, one final question, just as a follow-up on that. Have we heard anything about 2015 volumes or adjustments or any of that or is the expectation that, that may come out with the revised \u201814 numbers?","Joe Gorder","I think that\u2019s what their expectation is, is that it comes out it would be interesting to have \u201814s and \u201815s come out. Well, it would be interesting to have \u201815 come out in \u201914. I wouldn\u2019t think that there hasn\u2019t been our past practice, but I don\u2019t think there is anything that we\u2019ve heard to a great that\u2019s given us any indication of what \u201915 might be.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yeah, good morning everyone. Just on I guess a bigger picture, strategic question, $1.5 billion of growth CapEx, of which around 50% going into logistics. You've got VLP out there, $2.6 billion. So it's a relatively small MLP, but Valero's market cap has got a currency of its own. And obviously, you can drop down assets into VLP over time. Just get a sense of the color of how big you see the organic suite of opportunities in logistics. And then maybe even, any comments on using your equity to be more assertive, perhaps, in the inorganic M&A space?","Mike Ciskowski","Okay. Well, I think, we stated before that we Valero Energy have about $800 million of EBITDA that could be dropped to VLP. So, it\u2019s a very significant number. We completed the first drop here at the beginning of the third quarter on July 1, I think it was -- and that was about $154 million transaction. And I think it\u2019s fair to expect that we are working the subsequent drop transaction as we go forward. I think we recognized very clearly the value of interrelationships of the two entities and the multiple pickup we get when we drop Valero Energy down to VLP.","We have a lot of projects as you mentioned that are in our current growth capital that we are working on which will be assets that would add to the base of assets that can be dropped. So really the question is that we are working through is the pace and the timing on those. And we said we are going to grow VLPs distribution to 20-plus percent a year. We still are intending to do that. And so our drop schedule at a minimum would be able to accommodate that growth rate.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","It just seems like there's a large opportunity for companies in your space who have the skills to be very large and successful infrastructure companies, against the shell revolution to continue to shift assertively into that direction, given the relative multiples. So appreciate you might be going through the planning process now. But any thoughts about the direction you want to take the company?","Joe Gorder","Yeah, I think we\u2019re looking at host of different logistics project that are in development and will allow us to take advantage of what you've described. There\u2019s great opportunity with the shale plays. But I don\u2019t have anything specifically share with you right now ","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. Then, maybe a question for runs, just on crude. Obviously, LLS spiked last year, and then LLS collapsed in the fourth quarter. The spike is, let's hope its history. And let's focus on the future, where we could see, perhaps, a repeat of what we saw the fourth quarter. A couple of things seemed to happen last year. Obviously, we built gasoline for a hurricane that didn't happen.","There were lots of imports during the period. There was a rapid rise in inventories, seasonally. And you folks and others in the industry were trying to reduced inventories for the usual year-end planning purposes. So I'm just, sort of, the question. You mentioned BridgeTex earlier. But is there anything different that you see happening this year or do think this is sort of a new seasonality that's going to set in for the Gulf Coast crude prices?","","Joe Gorder","Yeah, thanks for that. I think the biggest difference that I see, is that crude runs are so much higher than what they\u2019ve been as of late which we go through some regional turnarounds that we head into Q3 or so. My thoughts is that this thing will get back to normal. As we\u2019re seeing September contract trade today and we\u2019ve seen LLS back down $2 to $3 under Brent and last year $7 under Brent. So things are starting to look normalize.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yes. And then, maybe, one tiny follow-on. Obviously, in winter, there's a difficulty pushing gasoline into the U.S. market and so you try and export the product into other markets. How are we, in terms of the ability for you to say, maintenance aside, run at a higher utilization than you would have done in the past? Because of the ability to export more product and out-compete other refineries around the world? Any color, there?","Scott Lively","This is Scott again. As you know that those gasoline exports are seasonal. So we do export less in 2Q and tend to export more in 3Q and 4Q especially we have more availability in butane works itself back into the pool. I think that we\u2019re going to cost advantaged. And we do see plenty of opportunities with growth and market in Central, South and Central America, South America and in Mexico we still see put in opportunity to put barrels out in those regions. So we still pretty good about our positions to export and keep refinery rates high in our system as result of those exports.","Joe Gorder","We are up on it. One last thing I\u2019ll add was Scott has said to your point, U.S. Gulf Coast capacity is most competitive capacity in the world. So if there we can save any market, we have low natural gas front. We are (indiscernible) and we\u2019re well positioned to maintain our assets. High utilization is we can find. We\u2019re not really up against any export logistic per se. So we don\u2019t really see being (indiscernible).","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thank you ","Operator","","And the next question comes form Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning, guys. Maybe a more specific follow-up on next question. I know you are not providing 2015 CapEx guidance at this point. It was asked and answered yet. Given you had the MLP and given midstream spending as a increase percentage of CapEx, how do MLP dropdown relate to your consideration of CapEx, and it would appear to me that they are direct offset and distributable -- potential distributable cash flows and I have follow-up? Thanks.","Joe Gorder","Well, I mean, that\u2019s a million dollar question right there. In the subsequent question that is, at what point in time do we start doing this logistics projects in VLP itself and not at Valero Energy for dropdown?","We have a lot of good projects that we are looking and what we are trying to understand is whole notion around, if you would look at gross capital or net capital number to be quite honestly, yes. We have a very good feel for I believe what we are going to be spending on refining side of the business that the wildcard here is, how much do we spend on the logistics side. So, I know you love to have a number and there will be a point when we give it you but I am just not prepared to share today.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","What would, let me ask you a question when you are evaluating midstream projects and what ultimately goes into the EBITDA that you characterize as MLP EBITDA. I mean, do you consider the relative cap rate versus the MLP drop rate in the overall calculation of the IRR. For instance the rate different and more color there, I think, would help us, I am just curious that\u2019s an element of your evaluation of what to proceed on?","Joe Gorder","Yeah. I believe it is.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Maybe lastly, then, for me, any update on the timing, we're keeping a midstream focus here, but any update on the timing of potential methanol facility decision and given Westlake Chemical Partners MLP IPO that uses a fixed-rate structure versus variable and is, I think it's up 25% this morning, well through the range? How does a structure like that factor into that project consideration, which I know is under review and I'll leave it at that? Thanks.","Joe Gorder","Okay. Well, honestly, you know, we mentioned earlier that we continue to take a look at the project and we are advancing engineering. Lane and his team are trying to get our arms around exactly, what the scope of the project is. And again, yet, to look at the transaction you mentioned to know the impact of it, so we will take a look and then perhaps we can look back with you and have actually involve and John.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","John Locke","Specific we are in Phase II. We are doing all those sort of engineering to major equipment so we can nail down the cost estimate. How that we view in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re in the process.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Okay. And that's the process prior to -- it's going to reach an FID. Is that accurate?","Joe Gorder","It\u2019s the process, I\u2019m sorry, can you say that again?","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","I'm sorry. Is that the step -- after that phase is complete, is that when you then decide whether or not to go to a final investment decision?","Joe Gorder","That phase we\u2019ll make a decision whether we feel so good about that we\u2019ll go ahead and order all the equipment, which would expedite the project. That\u2019s really the critical decision that we\u2019ve taken.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Great. All right, guys. Appreciate the information. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Allen Good from Morningstar.","Allen Good - Morningstar","Good morning, everyone. I want to try to come back to the export question and, maybe, get your longer-term outlook. There seems to be a lot of changes underfoot there, with a lot of the refining capacity additions in Asia and the Middle East, potential improvement in European competitiveness given exports of, maybe, heavy crude over there, maybe even light crude. I think you have a bunch of peers increasing exports as well. So could you just talk about your long-term outlook there and how you think the export market for U.S. refineries and Valero, particularly, will develop?","Scott Lively","Allen, this is Scott again. I think that we were a bit ahead of the curve versus Europe of course on running those price advantaged crudes. So depending upon how long that takes to work its way and you can still see more closures in Europe. And clearly, Europe\u2019s kind of at a pinchpoint between the United States -- and mostly U.S. and Russia.","Like I said before, I steel feel pretty good about our ability to export into these markets. A lot was made about Jubail coming on line. So far, you can see a sprinkling of cargos go here and there. But so far, what we\u2019ve seen is those cargos from Jubail have mostly gone into internal demand and stayed on the east coast of Africa.","So sure, going forward, there is more refineries, they are going to come online and by way of China, there is going to be more capacity in U.S. but you should see that tempered with refinery closure especially those ones that are marginal. And as we said before, we still see the prospect of world demand growth for diesel.","Allen Good - Morningstar","Okay. Switching to the condensate export question, just looking at your recent investment presentation. And you have some notes in there saying that at the end of the day, less condensates in the crude stream could ultimately be beneficial for Valero, given some of the utilization rates and yields. Have you been able to quantify, exactly, what the loss on utilization or yields may have been over the past couple of years, as those crude streams did get lighter with additional condensates?","Lane Riggs","This is Lane. I don\u2019t know -- I'm not sure, I can give you exactly the loss. It hasn\u2019t been large but what we do, we\u2019re very careful in terms of how we articulate the quality of those suppliers. We have deducts and we can\u2019t give you numbers but we have standard deductions with API gravity goes up. We try to offset any sort of financial penalties we might have. But as refiners, we personally would like to see the condensate out of the blended crude.","We\u2019re not but that\u2019s going to take a considerable infrastructure buildout to try to get condensate in whatever locations pushed to back in half. And so we\u2019re not necessarily opposed to condensate being segregated to other crude strengths. But today, we don\u2019t have. We haven\u2019t had any real major constraints based on these gravities that we certainly have. The way we purchase our crude, we certainly attempt to offset it.","Allen Good - Morningstar","And just a follow-up from the earlier comment regarding that, you\u2019re not interested in making any of those investments that would be separated too?","Joe Gorder","Well, again, our two crude units had a capacity there we provide them for 50 API. We can certainly run them at slightly reduced capacity. We can run even more. I think, the way we best -- the way we do things, we\u2019ll compare condensate and versus our alternative crude economic and that will determine how much we\u2019re going to run. I think what I was trying to talk earlier was I think, the industry and everybody making it stream, its going to have to try the market.","That was the like condensate, whether it\u2019s slightly altered condensate, process condensate, new condensate, I\u2019m not sure. That\u2019s I have to plan at own somewhere. Our assessment was it\u2019s going to be the Far East. But we will certainly our best relationship with condensate and crude oil is this becomes more available.","Allen Good - Morningstar","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Faisel Kahn from Citigroup.","Faisel Kahn - Citigroup","Yeah. Hi, guys. Just a couple of small questions. First one, with the Cushing inventory, sort of, reaching bottom, is there any impact to McKee and Ardmore for you guys or do you have sort of enough inventory within the refining gate to, basically, not be impacted by lower inventories at Cushing?","Randy Hawkins","Faisal, this is Randy again. The key specifically it\u2019s mostly a Midland market which is with crude oil at the moment. And similarly, Ardmore also takes some barrel out of that market as well. So we\u2019ve really not seen any impact on supply of the source barrels.","Faisel Kahn - Citigroup","Is it fair to say that, because of where production is, that you just don't need the inventory levels? Because you've got enough growth in production to offset sort of the balancing impact of having storage in place in previous years?","Randy Hawkins","Yeah. I think definitely to market goals are backward aided so there is no incentive for people to hold barrel there.","Faisel Kahn - Citigroup","Okay. Fair enough. Last question on -- actually two more questions. On the Corpus Christi dock, could that dock be used for condensate exports? Have you guys looked at that?","Lane Riggs","Yes. This is Riggs. We looked at that and they could be use for condensate.","Faisel Kahn - Citigroup","Okay. Fair enough. The last question is on getting barrels into Louisiana from Houston. Are you guys having any issues, or are you pretty much able to get as much crude from the western side of Houston into Louisiana? Any sort of constraints that you guys are seeing?","Randy Hawkins","No. This is Randy get in. No real constraint. I mean, it moving to your pipe on that Ho-Ho and barging and shipped in through Louisville. All that does satisfy and the rail is continuing to come down as well from the Bakken. So (Indiscernible) is well supplied.","","Faisel Kahn - Citigroup","Great. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate the time.","Randy Hawkins","Sure.","Joe Gorder","Thanks, Faisel. Thanks, Sylvia. I think with that we appreciate everyone calling in and those listening to our call today. If you have additional questions, please contact our IR department. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference maybe recorded.","I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Homer Bhullar. Sir, please go ahead.","Homer Bhullar","Good morning everyone. And welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you've not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our Web site at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it's says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.","Joe Gorder","Thanks Homer and good morning everyone.","Our system is flexibility and the teams relentless focus on safety enable us to deliver positive earnings in an otherwise weak margin environment during a period of heavy maintenance. The first quarter presented us with tough market conditions, differentials on medium and heavy sour crude oils were compressed by a number of factors including OPEC and Canadian crude production curtailments and Venezuelan sanctions.","We also started the year with gasoline inventories at record high levels and the gasoline crack at historic lows. Despite this challenging backdrop our premier assets and prior investments that have improved our feedstock and product flexibility enable us to achieve positive earnings and operating cash flow.","We demonstrated the flexibility of our system by processing a record volume of 1.4 million barrels per day of North American sweet crude oil as well as a record amount of Canadian heavy crude in the quarter. The Diamond Pipeline and Line 9B continued to provide cost advantage Cushing and Canadian crudes to the Memphis and the Quebec City refineries respectively.","We also continue to maximize product exports into higher net back markets in Latin America. Our investments that are expected to grow the earnings capability of the company continue to move forward. The Houston alkylation unit and the Central Texas pipelines and terminals projects remain on track to be operational in the second and third quarters respectively. The Pasadena terminal, St. Charles alkylation unit and Pembroke cogeneration unit are all on track to be complete in 2020. The Diamond Green Diesel expansion and the Port Arthur Coker are expected to be complete late 2021 and 2022 respectively.","Turning to capital allocation, we continue to adhere to our discipline framework. Our annual CapEx for both 2019 and 2020 remains at approximately 2.5 billion and you should expect incremental discretionary cash flow to continue to compete with other discretionary uses including cash returns, growth investments and M&A.","With respect to cash returns to stockholders, we paid out 55% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter and we continue to target an annual payout ratio between 40% to 50%.","Turning to financing activities, we completed a $1 billion public debt offering in March at a coupon of 4% with the proceeds being used primarily to redeem $850 million, 6.125% senior notes due in 2020. We also funded the buy in of VLP with $950 million of cash on hand in the first quarter.","Now, [Technical Difficulty] we remain constructive for the rest of the year. Product fundamentals continue to improve with gasoline and distillate inventories now below their 5-year averages. Additionally product shortages particularly in Central and South America should continue to support robust exports. The impending IMO 2020 fuel oil specs should also lead to higher gasoline and distillate cracks along with improvement in the medium and heavy sour crude differentials.","Our advantage footprint with its flexibility to process a wide range of feedstocks and reliably supply quality fuels to consumers here and abroad coupled with a relentless focus on operations excellence and a demonstrated commitment to stockholders continues to position Valero well for any market environment.","So with that Homer, I'll hand the call back to you.","Homer Bhullar","Thanks Joe.","For the first quarter of 2019 net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $141 million or $0.34 per share compared to $469 million or $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter 2018 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $431 million or $1 per share.","For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts please refer to the financial tables that accompany this release.","Operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2019 was $479 million compared to $811 million for the first quarter of 2018. The decrease from first quarter of 2018 was mainly attributed to significantly weaker gasoline margins and narrower medium and heavy sour crude differentials.","Refining throughput volume averaged 2.9 million barrels per day which was lower than the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to maintenance activities. Throughput capacity utilization was 91% in the first quarter of 2019. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.15 per barrel or $0.32 per barrel higher than the first quarter of 2018 mostly due to maintenance related expenses and lower throughput in the first quarter of 2019.","The Ethanol segment generated $3 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $45 million in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease from first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to lower ethanol prices. Ethanol production volumes averaged $4.2 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2019 an increase of 104,000 gallons per day versus the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to added production from the three ethanol plants acquired in November 2018.","As noted in the earnings release we are reporting the renewable diesel segment beginning this quarter. The segments generated $49 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $195 million in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the adjustments shown in the accompanying earnings release tables related to the 2017 blenders tax credit recorded in early 2018, first quarter 2018 adjusted operating income was $35 million.","Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 790,000 gallons per day in the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 419,000 gallons per day versus the first quarter of 2018. The adjusted operating income and sales volumes increased from the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to the expansion of the Diamond Green Diesel plant in the third quarter of 2018.","For the first quarter of 2019, general and administrative expenses were $209 million and net interest expense was $112 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $551 million and income tax expense was $51 million in the first quarter of 2019. The effective tax rate was 23%.","With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $10.1 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $2.8 billion. Valero debt to capitalization ratio after giving effect to the redemption of the 815 million senior notes occurring today was 26%. At the end of March, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity excluding cash.","We generated $877 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter excluding the favorable impact from a working capital increase of approximately $130 million net cash generated was $747 million.","With regard to investing activities, we made $726 million of capital investments in the first quarter of 2019 of which $453 million was for sustaining the business including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance.","Moving to financing activities, we returned $411 million to our stockholders in the first quarter; $375 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 414,000 shares of Valero common stock. The total payout ratio was 55% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. As of March 31, we had approximately $2.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.","We continue to expect annual capital investments for both 2019 and 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion, with approximately 60% allocated to sustaining the business and approximately 40% to growth. Included in that amount are turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments.","For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.72 million to 1.77 million barrels per day. U.S. Mid-Continent at 425,000 to 445,000 barrels per day. U.S. West Coast at 220,000 to 240,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $4 per barrel.","Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4.7 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.","With respect to the renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volume to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2019. Operating expenses in 2019 should be $0.45 per gallon which includes $0.16 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization.","For 2019, we continue to expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $840 million. The annual effective tax rate is still estimated at 23%. For the second quarter net interest expense should be about $115 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $560 million.","Lastly, we expect RIN's expense for the year to be between $300 million and $400 million which is approximately $100 million lower than the previous guidance primarily due to lower RIN's prices.","That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","ClayAugumini","Hey, good morning guys. This is Clay on for Doug. Thanks for taking my question. I've got a one and a follow up. I really want to talk about the gasoline rally recently. When you had to deconstruct them in the recent move higher seasonality and constraint have played a big role and both of these are non-discretionary. And what I think the market is worried about and why the rally has stalled is that the potential for industry utilization to ramp up and kill the crack. So what I'm hoping that you could speak to and help us understand? Or maybe some of the factors that could keep this from happening in particular, I'm looking at the Inland spreads and the quality spreads on the water and because of this I think I have a hard time believing that there is the incentive to next run. And maybe we got a glimpse of this on your fourth quarter where throughput was within guidance and not ahead which has been the case recently. And I guess, if this point is true then maybe this rally has a bit more durability than people think.","Joe Gorder","Gary you want to.","Gary Simmons","Yes, sure. Well, I can tell you its a lot more fun talking about gasoline in April than it was in January and we certainly feel good about the gasoline market. When we talk in January as you mentioned we were looking at a year-over-year overhang of 18 million barrels of gasoline. Since that time, since February we've seen refiner utilization average 87%. Now gasoline inventory is 11 million below where it was last year at this time.","In addition to that, you're heading into a portion of the year where we would expect seasonal demand trends to follow where we'd see a pickup in demand as you head into driving season. In addition to that you should see yield fall-off some as we're transitioning to summer grade gasoline. You have less butane in the pool. So, I think through driving season, we feel very good about the gasoline situation as you get into the fourth quarter we would expect if you would see some normal seasonal patterns there as well and you begin to build inventory.","I think this year, we do feel like there is an opportunity on gasoline that we haven't seen before because of the IMO 2020 bunker spec change. Our view is that low sulfur feedstocks are currently going to SECs where we priced against their low sulfur fuel blend value alternative and that ability to swing the low sulfur feedstocks out of the SECs and into the low sulfur fuel market will be supportive to the cracks longer term as it results in lower SEC utilization and lower gasoline production.","But when it comes to gasoline or all aspects of the business, we manage for the long-term there's certainly a lot of moving parts here, but we feel like we're very well positioned. Global demand remains healthy. Valero is the lowest cost producer and we're strategically located export product globally especially to the markets in Central and South America. So we feel pretty good about it.","ClayAugumini","Got it. And this is a follow-up looking at the screen today, gasoline cracks and diesel cracks seems to have finally converged. What does this mean for your [indiscernible] this summer, do you still have these signals remain in next [indiscernible] mode?","Joe Gorder","This he hasn't answered.","Gary Simmons","Okay. So we're swinging -- we have swung the heavy cat naphtha into gasoline.","ClayAugumini","Thanks Gary.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Prashant Rao","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to talk about the crude side. Joe, you mentioned a strong -- taking strong advantage of Canadian crudes on the heavy side and here we're also seeing Maya setting the discount a bit more so. I wanted two parts to this question, one wanted to know kind of a check on how much Canadian you were running in the quarter and what your thoughts are going forward? And then, two, any thoughts on the recent sort of reversion and discounting on Maya and how that might play out as we go through the year?","Joe Gorder","Yes. Prashant, good question. Gary, you and Lane want to take.","Gary Simmons","Yes. So we did just under 190,000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian, 49 of that was crude by rail that we delivered to Port Arthur with the remainder being pipeline delivered barrels. We would expect those volumes to continue in that range actually ramp up a little bit especially with the Venezuelan barrels off of the market. On the Maya formula, there's not a lot of help in terms of additional medium and heavy sour supply coming onto the market, but where we see the opportunity for the quality dips to improve is really heavy, high sulfur fuel moving weaker. And we came off the highs, where we were trading at 96% of Brent. Earlier this week, we were down to 89% of Brent. And our expectation is as you move closer to that IMO 2020 fuel spec change that high sulfur fuel would continue to get weaker and that will help the quality discounts move weaker as well.","Prashant Rao","All right. Thank you. Appreciate that. And then, the follow up I guess [Technical Difficulty] on feedstock side and maybe switching over to Diamond Green Diesel. Looking at what kind of underlying profitability, it looks like feedstock cost there being able to get not only profitable even before the low sulfur fuel, let me say low carbon fuel credit before the blenders credit as well. I kind of want to just get a sense of strategy and how things have developed in terms of the diversity of feedstock sourcing how that, what it takes to build up that network and sort of progress along those lines it looks like there's been some solid progress over the last -- obviously, for several years, but now that you are disclosing it as a separate segment kind of wanted to think about how we should look at that longer term of this year and further on.","Martin Parrish","Okay. Well, this is Martin. We've provided volume guidance today on an annual basis. We're also going to be publishing a DGD margin indicator on our Web site. We've been running at these higher rates now for six months feedstock is flowing fine. Our partnership with Darling Ingredients gives us an advantage in that space. They process about 10% of the world's meat byproducts. So we feel good about being able to source the feedstock. And looking forward to continued growth and expansion and we're looking at this expansion that Joe mentioned additional 400 million gallons a year that'll come on in late 2021.","Prashant Rao","And in terms of sort of beyond just the soybean indicator that you've given us sort of wondering if we could give it more color on how diversified we could get if you're able to share anything. I know that you've heard in other parts of the globe, if there's a lot of ingenuity in terms of what can be used as feedstock source. So I was just curious along maybe in those lines if you if you know how diverse it can get?","Joe Gorder","We're still running like we've said in the past. We're running about a third corn oil, a third use cooking oil and then a third beef tallow type -- beef tallow or choice white grease. So same mix as we've been running historically.","Prashant Rao","All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Manav Gupta","Hey, Joe, you talked about IMO 2020 in your opening comments. Yesterday there was a very positive development on that front. Ben Hawkings, the Deputy of Commercial Regulation and Standards at the U.S. Gulf Coastguard said that the Coastguard is getting ready to enforce the new fuel specifications and expects the industry to comply. He went on to say there is no possibility of slow rolling and he hopes for a harmonized global approach to enforcement. The way I see it, it's a big change from the stand some government officials were taking last October and they were talking about the phased implementation and possible delays. Some I'm trying to understand, do you believe the government is now more on board and the implementation program and so probability of success for rollout is materially higher than it was in October?","Joe Gorder","That's a very good question. I'll let Jason talk about some of the specifics.","Jason Fraser","That's right. Yes. We do agree with everything you said. We continue to expect IMO 2020 to be implemented and enforced. You don't schedule as most recently indicated by those comments by the Coastguard official you mentioned. It seems like things have quieted down with that administration and these EIA forecasts that come out over the last several months which didn't show a dramatic jump in prices. That's kind of calm the waters.","Manav Gupta","Thank you guys. Thank you for taking my question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez with Simmons Energy. Your line is now open.","Blake Fernandez","Thanks guys. Good morning. I had two questions for you. One, just probably for Gary on the supply side, but obviously there is a lot of discussion now with the Iranian waivers and potential for OPEC to ramp back up. I just didn't know if you had any comments on supply dynamics and how you see that may impact your inputs and maybe some of the heavy dynamics underway.","Gary Simmons","Yes. So far we don't have any indication of additional OPEC barrels making their way to the market. We don't have any coming into our system as of yet and we'll wait to kind of hear that. I think they're meeting in early May to determine whether they're going to ramp up production.","Blake Fernandez","Okay. Second question is on Diamond Green. I believe there was a bill submitted to the house on a potential two-year extension for the BTC and I didn't know if you had any updates or thoughts they are on lay of the land there?","Jason Fraser","Okay. This is Jason. Of course, we support the extension of the blenders tax credit. We did see that bill introduced in the House is also one that's been introduced in the Senate by Grassley and Wyden. And of course, this is one of Senator or Chairman Grassley's main initiatives or one of his programs, he will most aggressively push for. So we are hopeful that something will happen this year, of course with the change over leadership in the House, the Democrats have to sort through the Democrat leadership sort through their priorities for what they want to move this year. But we're hopeful something happens. And it is an issue that has bipartisan support which is very helpful with a split legislature like we have.","Blake Fernandez","All right. Thank you, Jason. Appreciate it guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Benny Wong","Thanks. Good morning guys. I just want to touch upon, I will follow up the question from Prashant about the widening Maya. I think we've seen widening sour differentials across the regions. Just wanted to get your perspective, what's driving this. Is it just really the weaker fuel oil prices or are you seeing other factors like corporate turnarounds or are you seeing simple refineries switching to a crude slate today ahead of IMO 2020.","Gary Simmons","Well, I think most of what we're seeing today is driven by several components in the formula we mentioned the high sulfur fuel getting weaker the Brent GI are widening also helps the Maya differential get weaker and then the final thing is Midland WTS is still part of the Maya formula. So as WTS gets weaker it helps as well. I think those are the key drivers and certainly high sulfur fuel oil should continue to get weaker and help the Maya spread wide now.","Lane Riggs","Hi. This is Lane. I will further color to that point. So right now medium sour you are asking about that as well. It's still a little bit out of the market with respect to its value relative to sweet and heavy. Those are the two most economic crudes. So there's still sort of an arbitrage that exists out there in the marketplace between medium and there is about 3% discount and you should see somewhat -- get some parity in all that, it all gets balanced again in the Atlantic basin.","Benny Wong","Great. Thanks. And my follow up questions just a little bit extension on Blake's question. Just wanted to get a temperature check on DC. It seems like from where I'm sitting, the EPA is a little bit more moderated with headlines of them signaling took and can issue less small refinery waivers and potentially walking back the proposal to freeze their CAFE standards. Just wondering how your discussions with them has changed and if they're kind of shifting their focus order approach a little differently going forward? Thanks.","Jason Fraser","This is Jason, again. And we hadn't seen them really ship their approach. They're definitely under pressure probably under constant pressure from the ethanol side. On the smaller farther waivers they have been for years, but they seemed to understand that the responsibility to grant smaller final exemptions is part of the statute, it's been reaffirmed by Congress and the court several times, have been several appellate cases on the issue. And so, we're encouraged by administrator Wheeler's comments at his confirmation hearing that he plan to follow the law. He understood how those programs are supposed to work and we hope the agency continues to act as they have in the past which is to grant the waivers where they seem to be appropriate.","Benny Wong","Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Roger Read","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I guess we could go back a little bit. Gary you mentioned earlier that you were running max diesel obviously diesel cracks for a little below what they have been. I mean not weak by any standard, but it was just one of you can dive in a little bit what you're seeing in terms of diesel or distillate demand both here in the U.S. and then in terms of export demand?","Gary Simmons","Sure. Yes. I think we had a little milder winter in the North Atlantic basin than what we typically had which hurt demand a little bit. That was certainly offset by lower production with the lower refinery utilization. I think moving forward certainly you're entering a time of the year where we typically see a little softer distillate demand as you don't have the heating oil demand. I think where this year is different with the market structure and the strong carry in the market, I think the [indiscernible] market will remain supported because as it weakens the barrels will be bid into storage. And so I think you'll see diesel continue to be supportive in the short-term and then you'll get the demand kick later in the year as we approach the IMO 2020 date.","Roger Read","When speaking on the IMO front, when do you think we really start to see it in the forward curve? You mentioned earlier I think everybody would agree with you, I saw over oil discounts puts pressure on the lights or the sweet sour down, but like when do you think that shows up in the forward curve because one of the questions we've been getting from investors is, remind this from my IMO, when do I believe that IMO ammo is actually real in a sense I need to see it occur before I want to invest wholeheartedly on that front.","Joe Gorder","So what we understand is really the last loads of high sulfur fuel oil that head to the Far East for shipping probably occurred in late September. So you start to see an impact on the high sulfur fuel market sometime in that late September, early October region. And then on the distillate side, I think it's probably in November, December type timeframe before you start to see an impact on the diesel side.","Roger Read","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess that's my two questions and I won't take up the slot formerly used by an analyst who's on a break right now.","Joe Gorder","Thanks Roger.","Roger Read","See you guys. Thanks.","Joe Gorder","See you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Low with Redburn. Your line is now open.","Peter Low","Hi. Thanks for taking my two questions. The first was just on the balance sheet. Giving is getting towards the top-end of your guided range. I just want to know how comfortable you are with it at current levels and how you expect to prioritize de-gearing versus buybacks over the coming quarters. The second was on the projects due to completion this year particularly the Houston alkylation unit. Can you give us any color on the extent to which you expect those to impact capture rates and earnings? Thanks.","Joe Gorder","Okay. So, Donna you want to -- yes, you want to.","Donna Titzman","So, yes, we're very comfortable we are on the balance sheet in the context of leverage we design that target 20% to 30% to give us plenty of flexibility for growing our business and taking advantage of acquisitions as they come along. So, we're very comfortable we're at. We're at 27%, we're paying some debt off today. So that's going to bring the debt back down to 26%. And Joe, what is the other...","Joe Gorder","Yes. The other he was dovetailing it in, Peter, you tell me if this is wrong, it sound like you are dovetailing it into the share repurchases. And we've been pretty clear all along that we weren't going to leverage the balance sheet to do share repurchases. I think that's why you saw the repurchases slightly less in the first quarter, we used the adjusted free cash flow metric as our target and that's how we're going to live with. We're running the business for the long-term and we feel that all of the components that we've identified, all of the goals we've set for ourselves are relevant and we don't want to deviate from that. So as cash flow picks up, I think you should expect that flywheel of share repurchase to increase also. But I wouldn't tie the two directly together the debt to cap and the share repurchase quantity. I hope that answers the second question.","Peter Low","Yes.","Joe Gorder","So, on the final question on the Houston alkylation on schedule to start up here in the second quarter specifically at the end of May, maybe give it for a June 1 startup. So what does that mean in terms of our results that means you're going to have about a third of the benefit in the second quarter and then you'll have the full benefit in the third and fourth quarter and it will absolutely go directly to capture rate. So some of our project like coppers don't go directly to improving our capture rate, we get additional volume, but this will because you're taking NGLs and getting all the way to sort of a premium gasoline component value so that should show up in our capture rates in the Gulf Coast.","Peter Low","That's great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Sam Margolin","Hey, good morning everybody. I had a supply question too. The last quarter's call there was some probing about the Venezuela sanctions and how that might affect you, but it looks like there's a lot of offset supply coming on from Brazil. Brazil production from 2018 was deferred it looks like it's coming on now. Is that a suitable substitute for you, are you looking at that at all, or does the spec not really work? I'm just wondering like what are the developments in your sort of Atlantic basin Latin America crude supply story since the last quarter's call and the Venezuela sanctions?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So, I would tell you since the Venezuelan sanctions about a third of the barrels we are getting from Venezuela then replaced by running incremental domestic lights, we about a third of it is incremental heavy Canadian, and then, a third of it is just opportunistic cargos and some of that production that you're talking about in Brazil fits into that opportunistic cargo. We've definitely seen more volumes of Brazilian crude coming into the Gulf and also our West Coast.","Sam Margolin","Okay. Thanks so much. And then, this is a -- it's been a recurring theme now for a while that you MidCon segments really starting to break out and capture versus historical rates are -- is up a lot. It obviously has a lot to do with Diamond Pipeline. Other operators outside of the Diamond partnership. Talk about Diamond a lot, it's an interesting strategic piece for other infrastructure that wants to loop into it, or connect it to some other ideas. Are you guys still in sort of a strategic dynamic review process with Diamond or are you very satisfied with the role it's playing in Valero today and you don't necessarily want to include it in other operators plans for trying to get crude to the eastern Gulf.","Joe Gorder","There's two pieces to that question, right. There's the -- I mean the conversation around strategic use of the pipeline. But I mean, our initial emphasis for the pipeline was to assure crude supply in a particular crude supply into the Memphis refinery. You guys want to talk about that at all.","Gary Simmons","Yes. That's gone extremely well. And we saw a stronger contribution of Diamond Pipeline in the first quarter '19 than we did in the first quarter of '18 and some of that's the water Brent TIR. The other change in our system was the Sunrise Pipeline which came online in the fourth quarter of '18. That not only improved our ability to get Midland Cushing, Midland barrels to Ardmore and McGee, but we are now able to get Midland barrels to Memphis and we certainly saw an uplift from that in the first quarter. Now, I'll let Rich handle the second part.","Rich Lashway","Sure. So it was in January there was -- open season was on the cap line was announced. And part of that reversal open season was to tie the Diamond into that cap line. So plane has got an open season out there that will conclude next week. I think its Monday, the 29, and so they'll see whether or not there's enough interest to expand the cap -- expand the Diamond Pipeline, which would then tie into a cap line reversal. So that would be the strategic part of expanding the pipeline to get Cushing barrels to the Gulf Coast.","Joe Gorder","So Sam, I mean from our perspective, the key is as Gary stated is just to be sure that we retain our ability to ship the volumes that we need into the Memphis refinery and then as an investor in the pipeline, I think we'll look at the options associated with a possible expansion.","Sam Margolin","Thanks guys. That is exactly my question. Okay. Thanks everybody.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Brad Heffern","Hey, morning everyone. Maybe for Gary. I was just wondering if you can give thoughts on West Coast product supply. Obviously, there's been a lot of outages, we've seen some larger import activity on the gasoline side and obviously, if the West Coast gets behind it can struggle to catch up during driving season. So any thoughts on how that plays out through the year?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So I think like we've always talked, the West Coast is a little long refining capacity but when you have maintenance activities at times at the market and we've seen maintenance activities on the West Coast and inventories are low heading into gasoline season which I think you know bodes well to a fairly strong gasoline season on the West ","Brad Heffern","And then, looking at the Gulf Coast crude runs this quarter, you guys ran the most sweet, you've ever run. He ran the least medium. I'm just curious, if that's sort of the most barbell that the system can get. Or is there still room for more light and less medium if the spreads are telling you that?","Lane Riggs","This is Lane. We were clearly in that mode, I thought I have alluded that earlier max. W have some turnaround activity or control refineries and turnaround. So, when you see us come out into the second or third quarter, our refineries come out of all this, you could see us have additional capacity where we're have that strategy. So we have some more room to do that.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Neil Mehta","Hey thanks a lot. Appreciate that the opportunity. So a couple of questions. I guess the first is, you had a number of organic projects that have come online over the course of last year and so just trying to think about what the earnings power would have been in the first quarter independent of some of those growth projects so we can isolate the growth on a commodity agnostic basis. Can you just talk about if the earnings power is structurally improved relative to a year ago and some of those projects have come online?","Joe Gorder","You guys want to talk about the impact of the project? I think [indiscernible] different than the last few quarters maybe we will summarize. Well, obviously, okay, I think the refinery, we only have the Wilmington and Cajon.","Gary Simmons","Yes. So the Sunrise definitely had a material impact on the first quarter results for us as you were able to capture that Midland to Cushing differential on the pipeline was space we have on Sunrise.","Lane Riggs","Neil, there's been a host of things though right. I mean we've got the Diamond Green Diesel expansion that we're seeing the benefits of also. And you've seen it multiple times but in the deck, we've got the fact that we believe that the projects that were completed produced another $340 million of incremental EBITDA. So, we -- if you compare year-over-year and how we performed in kind of a similar margin environment, I think you would find that the projects have contributed significantly to the earnings capability of the company.","Joe Gorder","Over pipeline projects and then the Diamond Green Diesel expansion.","Lane Riggs","Right.","Neil Mehta","Yes. That's helpful. And then, the follow-up question is, just on the cash balances, you guys have had around $2.8 billion. Is it fair -- is it a long-term target still to move towards $2 billion that's still the right level. I know you were running substantially higher than that before. But how do we think about that optimal cash balance number?","Donna Titzman","Yes. If you look at the $2.8 billion, so we know we issued some debt towards the end of March $1 billion that was slated to refinance the maturity that is in early 2020. Today, we pay -- we redeem that those notes today. So you kind of pro forma the cash, it was really closer to $1.9 billion at the end of March.","Joe Gorder","And Neil, we think that's still a reasonable target. And, we'll test around it both directions and just see if it holds up longer term. And then, the other thing to keep in mind is that we bought back the deal during the quarter and that was $950 million of cash. So there'll be times, when I think you'll see the cash balance increase, if we're looking at something like that. But otherwise the $2 billion is still probably a good point of reference for you guys to use in your modeling.","Neil Mehta","Perfect. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Phil Gresh","Hey, good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hi, Phil.","Phil Gresh","The first question with Diamond Green Diesel is here as a new segment. You gave us some color on throughput and then cost -- your JV partner, I think has given a view on EBITDA guidance of $1.25 to $1.40 per gallon, I believe. Your first quarter obviously was a bit below that maybe seasonality, you could talk to that. But is that a right way for us to be thinking about this business, is that something you'd agree with. Just a little color to help us think about this business longer term.","Martin Parrish","And this is Martin. I think that's a good way to think about the business you're right on the first quarter we were at $0.85 per gallon EBITDA that was negatively impacted by a hedge loss of $0.37 a gallon. So if you adjusted EBITDA would have been 122, I think a better way to look at it as the last six months because we had a big hedge positive in the fourth quarter. So if you look at the last six months the weighted average EBITDA was $1.24 a gallon. So right on top of the $1.25 and these hedge gain loss is not significant over the life of Diamond Green. It's just been these big moves in the ULS flat price in the last six months.","Phil Gresh","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. The second question I guess would be a bit of a follow up to Roger's question where he was asking about how the strip is representing expectations for the diesel crack looking out to early 2020. I guess is it your view that that many times we talk about the strip is never right, but is it your view that this is not an accurate representation of what might happen to the diesel price or there are some prior comments about how maybe there's going to be more BGO feedstocks that will enter the diesel pool. Just curious how you think this actually plays out over the next six to 12 months. Thanks.","Martin Parrish","Yes. So, I would say that I think the diesel forward curve is not a very good representation of what we would expect the foreign markets would look like, you are seeing more contango start to edge its way into the market. I think that will continue as you get closer to the date, but I think we'll have a stronger diesel environment than what's currently reflected in the curve.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Jason Gabelman","Hey, thanks for taking the call. I wanted to ask I know there was a question about the West Coast, but I wanted to follow up on it. I believe your Venetia plant has been down for a little bit. I was wondering what the impact was on the quarter and if you have line of sight when that asset is going to come back online.","Lane Riggs","Well, this is Lane. So yes, we have about eight days of downtime in our Venetia refinery we had a crude leak in the furnace and so we had to bring the entire refinery down to repair. And so consequently we moved a turnaround that we had budgeted in the first quarter '20 into the timeframe. So we're essentially executing a turnaround so we should start the refinery up sort of mid May-ish or somewhere in the later maybe it will be somewhere in the May timeframe term start the refinery up.","The other thing that we had happen in the quarter that didn't get a lot of press was we had our McKee refinery had an air blower -- main air blower Allergan. So -- and that was a big event as well in terms of our impact in the quarter an unusual event and thought it was $90 million. So if you're trying to sort of frame what the earnings potential for the first quarter could have been the bigger event in the first quarter actually was our McKee, again, it was about $90 million for the growth margin impact.","Jason Gabelman","Got it. Thanks. And if I could ask a question on I believe you moved the Memphis turnaround from April of this year into 2020 and I thought that was an interesting data point just because it seems like your peers are doing the opposite trying to conduct their maintenance in the first half of this year. So, I'm wondering if you saw something in the market that made you alter maintenance plans there. And then, just what you're seeing more generally in the industry on maintenance activities in the first half of this year and maybe into the second half as well. Thanks.","Lane Riggs","Yes. So unfortunately I guess some bad information, our methods refinery goes into an SEC turnaround in about a week or so. But, we don't normally try to position take you know we'll maybe nudge turnarounds around certain things, but we aren't taking. We didn't make a huge effort to try to move our turnarounds and to accommodate IMO 2020 is because we have a lot of assets. So, but anyway that's kind of where we are on that in terms of the industry we don't really comment on other players and industry or what we think maintenance activity might be.","Jason Gabelman","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes right up Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.","Matthew Blair","Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question here. So compared to a year ago, you ran substantially higher light sweet crude volumes or at least the share of your total crude slate and at the same time your default yield ticked up a little bit. And so I was wondering, can we draw a direct connection there that a higher distill yield with these lights or was that just noise your year-over-year.","Lane Riggs","Actually what we see is, we maximize light sweet. We tend to make the same amount of gasoline and less a little bit less distill. So a yield shift is probably more tied to hydro cracker utilizations and what units we actually had down for maintenance rather than a change in the crude slate.","Matthew Blair","Got it. Okay. And then just an accounting clarification, so there's this $2.5 billion of CapEx in the next two years. Does that include the 550 of spending for the Diamond Green Diesel expansion?","Joe Gorder","Yes, it will. Yes, it's not all in the year. Okay. And this is spread out over 2021.","Matthew Blair","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Craig Shere","Good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hi, Craig.","Craig Shere","What are the great comments about catalysts for improving cracks into the second half in 2020. I guess my question is more systemic in terms of the new mid cycle levels we might see aided by IMO 2020, or are you getting more confident that we could see some sustained benefit lasting three to five years here.","Joe Gorder","So really, I think that question goes to what's the sustainability of the tailwinds for IMO 2020.","Gary Simmons","Yes. I think it's hard for us to predict, how quickly shifts put in scrubbers. It looks like that's not going to be fast and that the impact of aim of 2020 will be longer lasting than what we initially assumed. But I don't know that we have a lot of great data on that.","Craig Shere","Are ships even able to put in scrubbers the way we were thinking a year ago, it sounded like simpler the waste water disposal becomes an issue now?","Gary Simmons","It certainly that the most economic scrubbers are the open lube scrubbers which put the sulfur back into the ocean. And so, as questions have come up whether there are going to be allowed to do that, it certainly presents another degree of difficulty when people are trying to make those capital investments.","Craig Shere","And last quick question. I noticed that the corporate expenses down sequentially and year-over-year, anything to read into efficiencies or cost controls?","Joe Gorder","We are always focused on efficiencies and cost controls. I just don't know if they would have been material enough that --","Jason Fraser","In the first quarter of '18, we actually had an environmental reserve adjustment, it is one of the special items that's reflected in the press release.","Joe Gorder","Okay.","Craig Shere","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Bhullar for closing remarks.","Homer Bhullar","Great. Thanks Liz. We appreciate everyone joining in and feel free to contact the IR team, if you have any additional questions.

At this time participants are in a listen-only mode. And later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Vanessa. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations & Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under Federal securities laws. These are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Now I'll turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, our team again operated safely and reliably, and did a good job of capturing margin in a low, but improving margin environment. We also executed our projects well, completing major turnarounds and progressing on growth investments, while optimizing our portfolio.","These actions enabled us to produce positive cash flow and to return a healthy amount of cash to stockholders. In the market, we continue to see solid product demand domestically and internationally. The sustained low price of crude oil and petroleum products, along with strong export demand, helped create a pull on domestic product inventories. We're also encouraged by the modest return of domestic shale crude production, which is good for diesel demand and crude differentials.","On the downside, we continue to see negative impacts on Valero's earnings from exorbitant RINs prices. For the year, we expect to incur costs in the range of $750 million to $850 million to purchase RINs. At these levels, the expense is significant to our company and has our full attention.","You've likely seen that we filed a petition with the EPA to address this issue. Our efforts are focused on moving the point of obligation, which we believe will not only level the playing field among refiners and retailers, but it'll also improve the penetration of renewable fuels, reduce RIN fraud, lower RIN speculation, and reduce costs for the consumer. We have had many constructive conversations with regulators and these conversations continue today. As you'd expect, we continue to work this issue aggressively.","As I mentioned a moment ago, our refining operations were very good. We ran reliably during the quarter and experienced very little unplanned downtime. We completed major turnarounds at our Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries, which our teams planned very well and executed safely and successfully, and we will be wrapping up the restart process over the next few days.","Our ethanol business performed very well, recording its highest operating income contribution since the fourth quarter of 2014. Our plants are the most competitive in the industry and are run by dedicated people. So it's great to see them again contributing to Valero's earnings in a meaningful way.","Regarding strategic investments, we're pleased to have both our new crude units up and running. The Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, and the Houston crude unit, which was completed in June, both ran well during the quarter.","Turning to the development of our Houston alkylation unit, the project is in the engineering and procurement phase and on track for completion in the first half of 2019. The economics of this project look good, given the tight outlook for octane and it also positions us well for Tier 3 gasoline compliance. Looking ahead to 2017, we expect spending on capital investments to be similar to the budget for 2016, which was $2.6 billion.","I also want to share an update on our portfolio. Effective October 1, we disposed of our Aruba business. We've been on the island and in the community for a long time and worked hard to produce a win-win for Valero and the Government of Aruba. In addition, the Government of Aruba secured a new operator who plans to invest capital in the site and operate it as a bitumen upgrader, which should have a positive economic impact on the community. We're happy for the people of Aruba and for the assets to have a renewed purpose on the island.","With respect to Valero Energy Partners, the dropdown of the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal in","September helped us achieve our dropdown target for the year. Yesterday, we announced the distribution increase of 5.5% for the third quarter, which puts us on track to deliver 25% distribution growth through 2017. Although we don't plan to provide dropdown guidance for 2017 at this time, we are comfortable setting the target for annual distribution growth for 2018 of at least 20%. You'll hear more from VLP on their call later this week, but VLP has excellent operations, is in great shape.","And finally, despite significant turnarounds during the quarter and the low-margin environment, we generated solid cash flow from operations. So far this year, we returned 148% of net income to stockholders and we're well ahead of our 75% payout ratio target for the year. We're also extending our payout ratio target of at least 75% of net income to 2017.","So with that, John, I'll hand the call back over to you.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Thank you, Joe. For the quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $613 million or $1.33 per share, which compares to $1.4 billion or $2.79 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Excluding an income tax benefit of $42 million, or $0.09 per share related to the Aruba disposition, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income was $571 million, or $1.24 per share. Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts that begin on page three of the earnings release tables.","Operating income for the refining segment in the third quarter of 2016 was $990 million, which was $1.3 billion lower than the third quarter of 2015. Primary drivers of the decline were weaker gasoline and distillate margins due to elevated product inventories, lower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil, and higher RIN prices.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2016, which was in line with the third quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 95% throughput capacity utilization, with major turnarounds that occurred at the Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries. Both refineries are currently in the process of restarting operations.","Refining cash operating expenses of $3.63 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016 were $0.17 per barrel lower compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses and adjustments related to the Aruba disposition.","The ethanol segment generated $106 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2016, which was $71 million higher than in the third quarter of 2015, largely due to higher gross margin per gallon resulting from lower corn prices.","For the third quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $192 million and net interest expense was $115 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $470 million and the effective tax rate was 18% in the third quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower-than-expected and lower than the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to income tax benefit on the Aruba disposition and the favorable settlement of an income tax audit.","With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end, total debt was $9 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $5.9 billion. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 25%. We had approximately $5 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. We generated $863 million of cash from operating activities in the third quarter, which was after the impact of $176 million of unfavorable working capital changes, primarily a decrease in accounts payable.","With regards to investing activities, we made $453 million of capital investments.","Moving to financing activities, we returned $778 million in cash to stockholders in the third quarter, which included $276 million in dividend payments and $502 million for the purchase of 9.2 million shares of Valero common stock. We completed a $1.25 billion public debt offering in September, and in October we repaid $950 million of senior notes due in 2017. On a pro forma basis, after the repayment, our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%.","Our Board of Directors approved an incremental $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization in September. And at quarter end, we had approximately $2.7 billion of repurchase authorization remaining. For 2016, we expect capital investments to total about $2.4 billion, which is slightly below our previous guidance due to lower turnaround costs and the timing of some growth CapEx spend.","For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.58 million to 1.63 million barrels per day. U.S. Mid-Continent at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day. U.S. West Coast at 270,000 to 290,000 barrels per day. In the North Atlantic, at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day.","Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect cost attributed to meeting our biofuel blending obligations, primarily related to RINs in the United States, to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016.","Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.9 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. G&A expenses for the fourth quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be about $200 million and net interest expense should be about $150 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $465 million and our effective tax rate should be around 31%.","That concludes our opening remarks. And before we open the call to questions, we ask that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Maybe if I could just ask \u2013 start out asking on payout and cash return to shareholders. Again \u2013 and this has been the case, I guess, over the course of the year, where you significantly exceeded your official payout target again despite a fairly challenging year. I mean, how do you think about managing this going forward? I know you reset the bar at 75% for 2017. How do you view the balance between returning the cash to shareholders and preserving optionality for growth projects that are \u2013 and (14:25) M&A, if necessary?","Unknown Speaker","Well, all of those options are part of our capital allocation. So we did set the target at, at least 75% for 2017. So going forward we feel like that's an appropriate way to go into the \u2013 appropriate rate to start the year with, and then we'll analyze that as we move through the year and adjust it as accordingly.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Then maybe one question on the product environment as we head into the winter. I mean, last year the industry massively overproduced gasoline through the winter, setting up a challenging position into 2016. Can you share your thoughts, as we head into this winter, on managing inventories of gasoline versus just for (15:16) balance as you shift to winter-grade gasoline and what role \u2013 I know on the last quarter we talked some about potential for economic run cuts into the latter part of the year. Do you still see that as necessary in managing inventories, or we done enough work at this point where you think you're okay?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Ryan, this is Gary. I think that we will need to see some economic run cuts in the industry. If you look at what's happened in the market, Chicago has been selling off fairly sharply over the last week and we're starting to see inventories build in the Mid-Continent. So, typically, especially in that land locked region, the market is short product in the summer and becomes long product in the winter. And I think refineries in that region will need to cut to balance the market as we move into the fourth and first quarters.","Elsewhere, I think a lot of what you saw last year in terms of refiners running high on utilization and producing summer-grade gasoline was really a function of the steep carry in the market. And certainly at least the Brent curve is flatter this year than what we saw last year. And I think as there's not as much carry in the market, it will go ahead and cause refiners to cut down on utilization and avoid some of the products build that we saw last year.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Ryan.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a couple of questions I'd like to kind of hit on here. First as part of the capital allocation and something that's gotten hammered in some prior conference calls, so let's get out the tools again for this one. M&A and plenty of units appear to be on the market, not all, of course, would be interesting to you. But I was wondering how you're looking at the M&A market, and is that still something that seems attractive to Valero?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. Yeah, Roger, this is Mike. It is attractive. We're \u2013 on the capital allocation side it's definitely part of our strategy. We're interested in acquiring logistics assets that provide third party revenue or are strategic to our core business. And on the refining side, we're interested in assets that are high quality, globally competitive and advantaged location. So for us that primarily means the U.S. Gulf Coast.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And any thoughts beyond the Gulf Coast of anything that \u2013 I mean, is there any real interest in moving beyond kind of your existing footprint further into Europe, anything like that?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Roger, this is Joe. I mean, if assets came into the market, we'd look. But I would tell you, no, there's nothing on the radar screen right now outside of what Mike described to you. I think if you look at our system, you see where we could produce the greater synergies and that would be the U.S. Gulf Coast, and so that is our focus.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Appreciate that, and then unrelated follow-up. You mentioned the improvement in U.S. drilling being good for diesel demand and for the differentials. Obviously, diesel demand happens quicker. Do you have kind of a rule of thumb that you use for rigs and diesel demand on either a \u2013 I don't know \u2013 I guess, a daily basis or anything like that?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Roger, this is Gary. I really can't \u2013 I don't have any insight into that at all.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Very interesting question, though.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","We all looked at each other, Roger, when you asked it.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. So I've stumped the masters for a change. Appreciate it, guys. Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","You got it.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, Phil.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question is just on the capital spending for this year. Obviously, you've been running at an exceptionally low rate, even relative to your guidance for the full year. So wondering what the key drivers of the lower capital spending have been, and if there's something specific in the fourth quarter that would suggest such a high rate implicit in the full year guidance.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. The capital for 2016 here is, we've adjusted it for $2.4 billion. It's primarily due to lower turnaround costs than what we had anticipated. And then we have some timing on our growth capital expenditure spend that's being lower. It's really a timing issue, as John discussed in his notes. So some of that's being pushed to the future here.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just maybe a second question on the balance sheet. With your leverage ratio at 22%, which is still pretty conservative relative to the 20% to 30% target range, if fundamentals remain challenging again next year like they were this year, should we think that you'd be willing to be similarly aggressive next year? Is there any reason that this year would be unique?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Aggressive in what -","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In terms of buying back well above your target.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Oh. Yeah. I mean, what we do consider, in a lower earnings environment, the net income obviously is a little bit lower, but we do have quite a bit of depreciation in there. So we look at other factors as well as cash flow. So we'll look at our cash flow generating capabilities and all our sources of cash in paying out and buying back the stock.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I guess my \u2013 the question would be, are you willing to add a little bit more leverage, if necessary, to continue down the path of buybacks?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","No, we would not. We would not lever up to buy back stock.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Neil.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Joe, can we get your comments on this RINs topic. Thanks for your comments earlier. But what do you think the political appetite is to actually change the RVO this year, and then from your dialogue and discussion with Washington to ultimately change the point of obligation?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, okay. So, it's very hard for me to comment on the political situation, so let me focus on the second part first. Okay? And I mentioned that the conversations that we've had have been very constructive. We've had conversations not only with the regulators, but also with the White House. And there is a clear acknowledgment that the structure of the current program isn't delivering the desired results. And so, these are smart people that we're talking to, and they're really trying to understand it and figure out.","So, as an industry, let me just say this, the independent refiners, AFPM and certainly Valero, we're working with them to help them understand the issue, certainly as we see it. And there's a clear acknowledgment that we've got a situation that needs to be resolved.","Now, as far as the political climate, you know what, we're couple of weeks away from the election. And although we would love to see something change this year, I don't know that we'll get that. But it's certainly receiving enough attention and it is being discussed, to the point where we believe that it's getting worked and that we should have some type of resolution and relief in the not too near future.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate that, Joe. And the second is more specific to the quarter. It was a strong quarter, particularly in the Gulf Coast. Can you talk about what you think drove the strength of the captures despite the downtime at Port Arthur? And any of these factors that you would define as more one-time versus repeatable?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Neil, this is Gary. I think, first, we ran very well and that certainly contributed. When I look at the market factors, I would say the biggest thing I see is, we buy a lot of other feedstocks other than crude, a lot of VGO and resids. And if you look at the pricing of the VGOs and resids that we purchased in the U.S. Gulf Coast system relative to Brent, they were much cheaper than what we saw either last quarter or a year ago at this time. And I would say that was the biggest driver to the capture rates.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great, guys. Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Joe, I hear you talking about the U.S. Gulf Coast as the desired M&A target region for you. But of course that Shell is also putting up their San Francisco refining system for sale and realistically not too many people will be interested in buying. So from an M&A standpoint, does it make it intriguing for you to look at that, given that you already have two refineries? Now if you add another one, you may get something that you benefit probably not as much as what you can get from the Gulf Coast, but at the same time the competition for the bid is probably much lower.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. Paul, that's a very good question and let me just share this that when we have looked at our ability to acquire additional assets in California historically, we have been precluded. And it's more of a FTC issue for us than anything else. I think it would be very, very difficult for us to execute another refinery acquisition in California. Perhaps the West Coast would be something that would be viable, but I don't think we could get another deal done in California. So, it really hasn't been something that we've spent a lot of time talking about.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So even after Tesoro get approval to buy Carson, you think that the whole FTC restriction is still being applied?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes, I think for us it certainly would be.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I see. Okay. Second question that you do have a nice UK operation. Just curious that on the ground what have you seen in terms of the European demand? Are they \u2013 I mean, we have seen unseasonal uptick in the European refining margins. So is it driven primarily because people on the refinery downtime or that the underlying strength and the demand is better than people think?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Paul, this is Gary. I don't know if it was really tied to downtime or not, but we did see very good wholesale demand through our UK system. And our wholesale profitability certainly contributed to our results in the North Atlantic Basin.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, Gary, you think it's more demand-driven than supply?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","I really don't know that I see the data well enough to be able to comment on that, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I see. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, Joe. So, some encouraging comments this morning on the RFS and the RFS topic. Can you give us update on your lawsuits? Procedurally, where they stand? What are the key dates moving forward, just so we can at least follow how things have progressed on that more hostile front?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. Hey, listen, Evan, why don't I let Jay Browning, who's neck deep in this thing just give you some color?","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Perfect.","Jay D. Browning - Valero Energy Corp.","The timeline is really going to be driven more by the process that Joe was describing. EPA's expected to finalize a rule, I believe, by the end of November. And the litigation will play out and there's lots and lots of players who are involved with that. So there is \u2013 at this point there's really nothing to put out there in front of you in terms of detail on timing that would be crucial to the process. I think other factors \u2013 the political process is more the driver at this point.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, I mean, litigation is kind of being used in that, I guess, negotiation or information awareness process at this stage?","Jay D. Browning - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I mean, the litigation is out there, but it is more or less used as a framework and as a last resort. Obviously, our preference would be for EPA to volitionally move the point of obligation of its own accord rather than being forced through the litigation process. But we've got the litigation out there just to \u2013 as a placeholder and a stake in the ground, if you will, just to let everybody know this issue is not going to go away.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And November's approaching. My second question is more of a macro question. We look at global turnarounds for the industry, at least planned, as being much lower in 2016 relative to 2015 and that having been a major contributor to weaker sequential cracks (29:10) this year. You can see it and you've mentioned it in the higher utilization data. I know Valero \u2013 I know you guys plan turnarounds several years in advance, but can you give us any color on your expectations for planned maintenance into 2017, at least sequentially higher or lower, and any views on that potential normalization of turnarounds providing a better environment in 2017?","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Evan, this is John. I think you summed it up. We really don't have kind of a forward view on turnarounds that we can share. I know there's resources out there where people can go and get views from contractors and what not, but I think our in-house view is we just don't have forward guidance on turnarounds.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. All right, guys. Thank you.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Evan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert with Simmons.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Appreciate the guidance \u2013 or target on the 75% payout for 2017. I was hoping you could talk about some of the major factors that you expect to influence profitability in 2017. Some of the factors we're watching, Tier 3 implementation, CAFE standards, potential OPEC cuts. What do you see as the major drivers for 2017 margin environment?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","So, Jeff, let me go ahead and \u2013 that's one of those questions that, I mean, we just are going to kind of share musings on I guess. So, why don't I just see if Gary and Lane have any comments for you on it?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","I guess I'll start with the OPEC cuts, Jeff, that you brought up. So far, we'll know a lot more about what's going to happen there when they have their November meeting. But if you look at the proposed volumes of the cuts, it looks like the volumes are about the same as what Saudi Arabia typically burns in the summer for power generation. So I don't know that we'll see any real impact on exports even if they had the cuts.","But overall, the world is still oversupplied with oil and we expect we'll see greater exports from Nigeria, Libya, Kazakhstan, Iraq, and Brazil. So we still feel like on the crude feedstock side, you're going have this competition between medium sour crudes and light sweet, where they're competing for available refining capacity, which will cause the medium sour discounts to be wide. And then with additional exports from Canada and South America on the heavy side, the heavies are going to have to compete with medium sours, and so we expect good discounts there. That's kind of a view of the crude markets.","On the product side, I think we think that the gasoline market, as long as you're in this low price environment, you'll continue to see good demand response on gasoline. And then on distillate, we expect a little bit more normal winter weather in both the United States and Northwest Europe will help the distillate market along with some recovery and economic growth, and we'll see a little bit stronger distillate cracks going into next year. Lane, I don't know what else you -","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","The only thing I'd comment on is Tier 3. January 1 of this coming year is when Tier 3 really comes into effect. There are people like us who generated credits with our existing units under Tier 2, which put us in position not really needing to get all of our capacity up and running until 2020. But different people \u2013 or different companies and refineries are in different position with respect to that. So between 2017 \u2013 beginning of 2017 and somewhere in the 2020 timeframe you'll see these units start up. That will destroy octane, so you should see alkylate and the premium regrade strengthen throughout that period.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Thanks. Secondly, if I could ask about your RINs guidance for the full year. We've lost our ability to track RINs prices on a regular basis, and I was hoping you could comment on where RINs prices are now. It would appear that there's either a price or a volume increase in the fourth quarter that would be required, given the first three quarters of expenses you've had to get into this $750 million to $850 million range.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, yeah \u2013 no, Jeff, I think, look, what's going happen in the RINs prices going forward, we've heard a lot of RINs commentary about things that could affect the prices, so I think we have a forecast. We have a view. We set that out. It's a pretty wide range accordingly, right, $750 million to $850 million. You can see where our actuals have been through the year. But we just have to kind of stay tuned and see. We're not prepared to change it at this time.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I mean, year-to-date we're at about $525 million is the expense. Second quarter was roughly \u2013 or third quarter was roughly $200 million.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","All right. Thanks for your comments.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","And, Jeff, just one thing. We're not trying to be resistant to giving you guidance on this. But if you look historically at where they've been, from 2011 to 2015, I think RIN price averaged like $0.33. Last year they were like $0.55 \u2013 $0.50 to $0.55. This year, obviously, they've been higher than that. And I think a lot of it comes down to where is the EPA going to set the RVO. And if they set a high RVO, where they're pushing us through the blend wall, I think we can all expect that we're going to have high RINs prices. And if they set it at a reasonable level that's achievable by industry, then I think we'll see it come off again. There's so many reasons that it's high right now, but it is clearly those with length are taking advantage of those that are short, and we're seeing that in the speculation in the market. So again, it's an unregulated market with not a lot of transparency. It is really very, very difficult to forecast.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Yeah, certainly opportunity for substantial volatility. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, so sorry, bud.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Brad.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Gary, following-on on the OPEC question from earlier. I was curious specifically about Venezuela. I think it would be consensus that those are among the most at-risk volumes in the world right now. So I'm curious how much Valero takes from Venezuela, and also if you take any sort of net credit risk in your commercial activities with Venezuela?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, so I'll comment on \u2013 really our volumes are not consistent month-to-month. They vary up and down, and I'll let Mike comment on the credit.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. Most of the business that we have is with Citgo, but we really don't discuss our credit analysis and stuff with our various customers.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, got it. And then, Mike, I guess following-on on an earlier question about CapEx, maybe trying to attack it a different way. I think that year-to-date you guys have spent like $1.4 billion in CapEx. You've been doing like $450 million or $500 million a quarter. So that would imply like $1 billion of spending in the fourth quarter. Is there any reason why that would be the case? Why the spending would go up so much? I know in the past sometimes you've included like an acquisition or something in those numbers. Is that what's responsible for it?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","No, we don't include acquisitions in these numbers. I mean, it's the estimate that we have at this time. We've got the turnaround spend being finished here. And so that's the number that we've decided to give at this point. There's probably a little downside \u2013 or it will come in a little below that.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with UBS.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on the payout ratio there and maybe narrow it a little bit and focus more on the dividend. I think the goal earlier this year was to get that dividend higher, closer to peers or at least at the top end of the range. And I guess you're there right now. So, just curious your appetite to increase it from here as you head into next year and how that figures into your 75% ratio.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, we've already increased the dividend once this year. But if you look at how our history demonstrates, we would like to be in the position of increasing our dividend annually. And as you mentioned, our intention is to pay at the top end of the range, and so we'll monitor that and stay at the top end of the range as we move forward.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. That makes sense. And then second question just wanted to follow-up on your comments around, I guess, export demand for refined products and maybe a few different angles here. I guess we're surprised that it's actually held up this strong, because we continue to hear about the bloated stockpiles globally, anecdotally here about Chinese gasoline cargoes hitting the East Coast of the U.S., and so clearly lot of product out there. And I guess I'm just wondering how sustainable that demand is, if you can give us some granularity on where that pull is coming from, and how much is maybe refinery outages in South America that maybe you can't count on to always be there.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, this is Gary. I think we continue to see very good demand for gasoline into Mexico and South America. I think in the short term some of that is certainly driven by refinery outages, but we see good growth in that region and expect that we'll see continued exports into those regions moving forward. Certainly, the opening up of Mexico will also help us with our export business as well. Distillates we see good demand in both South America and the yard to Europe is currently open. So we see very good demand on the distillate side as well.","Spiro M. Dounis - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Appreciate the color. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice results on the quarter. Gary, just following-up on that last comment on the exports, it looks like there was a pretty healthy decline quarter-to-quarter, and I didn't know if that's just kind of seasonal in nature, if the arb window simply closed or anything like that. I didn't know if maybe it was potentially reflective of weakness in demand.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","No, Blake, I'll break it apart. On the gasoline side we did 93,000 barrels a day, which is down some, but gasoline typically follows seasonal patterns. While you're in driving season here in the U.S., we typically don't export as much and it's more a statement of the strength of the U.S. market rather than lack of demand into the export markets. ULSD we did 236,000 barrels a day. If you add the jet and kerosene, we were at 283,000 barrels a day. There it was more a function of the turnaround activity we had in the Gulf. The Meraux hydro cracker was down and then we had the Port Arthur turnaround. And so it just limited the availability of export quality distillate into our system, and that's why the numbers are down on the distillate.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it. Okay. And then the second question. I realize you're not going to want to get into too much detail on guidance on this, but typically when we see a crude spike like we've see in this quarter, there tends to be a negative impact on the secondary product pricing and resid. And I'm just curious if you're kind of witnessing some of that in the marketplace. I guess, what I'm fishing around on is, should capture rates maybe suffer a bit quarter-to-quarter as a result of the rapid increase that we've seen?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Blake, you're correct. Normally you would see that. The one thing that's different for us is we've seen that propylene prices spike fairly considerably. So the strength in propylene in our system thus far has really offset the negative impact of the secondary products that we would normally see when flat price goes up.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Good deal. Okay. Thanks a bunch. Appreciate it, guys.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","I appreciate you taking my questions. Hey, Joe. So, Joe, on the buyback, I guess dividend distribution, the 75% target. Given that you've obviously been running pretty well ahead of that, is there any consideration to either reconsider the absolute level or the balance between dividends and buybacks? And I've got a quick follow-up please.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, obviously \u2013 and I'll let Mike speak to this. But, Doug, obviously, we're always looking at that. And Mike mentioned earlier, okay, you use 75% of net income because it provides absolute transparency into what the number is, and that's one of the things that we use for planning purposes. Mike's also looking at his percentage of cash flow dependent on how things are there. And then again, we continue to look at the balance between the dividend and the buybacks. In our view, though, the dividend is nondiscretionary. The buyback is discretionary. And so we need to be very confident that we're going to continue to have cash flows and that we're going to be able to continue to manage the capital budget the way that the company's done over the last couple of years to be sure that if we increase the dividend, we're good to go. So, Mike, with that what would you...","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","I don't really have anything to add to that. I mean, the dividend is the commitment to the shareholder and that is our priority.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","I guess, is there \u2013 maybe I don't want to belabor this particular point, but in terms of dividend growth, if you were thinking kind of mid-cycle earnings level for the company, is there an aspiration to have a dividend growth target on top of that, or are we just going to stick with the 75%?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, for now we're going to stick with the 75%, Doug. And I think we've answered it. We're not going get pinned down right now on announcing a dividend increase, that's for sure. But I think we're going go ahead and stick with the 75% for the time being and we'll continue to look at it.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. My follow-up hopefully a quick one is, as the earnings mix changes a little bit, as you see more coming from the MLP obviously over time, what's the guidance on the tax rate going forward? Because, obviously, it's consistently been at a pretty better level, I guess, compared to what we would have expected. So, this run rate for the tax rate and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, this quarter we had a couple of items that benefited our tax rate. Our guidance was 30%. We had the Aruba disposition and that provided, I guess, it was about 6% improvement on the tax position. We had the favorable settlement on an income tax audit. That provided about 4%. So those would have given us a 28% when you back those out. Our guidance was 30%. So we had a few minor things. Going forward, 30%, 31% looks like a good number.","Doug Leggate - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, fellows.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Maybe just to follow-on from Doug's question on the dividend in a different way. I mean, you are investing just under $1 billion of growth capital, which should provide some sort of uplift to EBITDA over time. I mean is one way to think about it is, you've got this net income payout and you're willing to sort of keep that flat, and then as this growth capital comes in, you could perhaps use that to drive the dividend higher? And then specifically, on that growth capital, I mean, talk a little bit about the funnel to maintain that $1 billion level and maybe the split between refining and logistics just at the very high level.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","On our capital, I think next year we're looking at similar to our budget for 2016, about $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion. $1.5 billion of that will be for sustaining and maintenance capital, about $1 billion or so for growth capital, and that will be split about 50%-50% between refining and logistics. So right now we're comfortable at the 75% target on the payout, so that's where we're at on that.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Ed, that was \u2013 your question was kind of a mouthful. But it was \u2013 it's hard to say that, okay, all the incremental income produced from growth projects is going go into the dividend. If we knew what margins were going to be in two months, if we were selling something where we could set the price and set the margin and just the only issue is how much are you going to manufacture, it'd be wonderful. But that's not the way this business functions. And because we've made the commitment to the dividend, we're very careful with it. We've also told you guys, we're not going to sit here and accumulate cash. And that's why we've gone ahead and exceeded the payout ratio target of 75%, because we've had stronger cash flows than we had anticipated. And so we've gone ahead and used the funds accordingly. We have a lot of discipline around the capital budgeting process, and you're not going to see that whipsaw significantly.","So, it's not like Lane and Gary and Rich are running out trying to find another $1.5 billion of capital projects so that we can spend the money. So anyway, I think you should expect consistent performance from us on this. And, again, we will continue to look at the dividend and I would expect, as Mike said, that we would continue to try to increase the dividend. But we're not prepared to commit to it right now.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, and then the second one is, unfortunately, another follow-up on RINs. So do you think that the November ruling would actually deal with the point of obligation? And if they do deal with the point of obligation and say move it to the blending racks, what would be the impact on your RVO in total?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well...","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Because presumably you have a big impact, but just trying to get a clarity on that.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I'm just trying to think through how to answer that. And I think I would rather not, because we haven't given any guidance on what our absolute RVO is. So giving you a number for it after the fact, but it would go down materially. So...","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then on the EPA \u2013 sorry...","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Go ahead, buddy.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Sorry. On the whether this ruling at the end of November is actually going to deal with the point of obligation.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what their plan is. I would love to think that they were going to do it, but I think all we've got commitments from them on so far is that they're going to announce the obligations. It would be very nice if they would open up our petition to a rule making on it so that we could have some conversation around it. And as Jay mentioned, if they would do that, then I think we would see some effect on the RIN price. But I'm not been very good at trying to predict exactly what they're going to do.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everyone. Just if I could immediately follow-up while we're on the dreaded subject. Joe, did you petition as Valero because \u2013 why didn't the refining industry lobby petition as opposed to you guys doing it individually? Is that an evidence that's there's a split amongst refiners?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, okay. So first of all, we did it because it's a material issue to us and we're a large refiner, and we're going to do what's best for us. Secondly, the AFPM did also file and their petition is similar to ours to move the point of obligation. So it \u2013 your third question is, is everybody in the industry of a like mind on this? The answer would be no, and I think it depends on where you happen to sit. If you're long RINs with a more integrated system through retail, I think you're going be a lot more comfortable with the status quo. And if you're an independent refiner or a retail marketer that doesn't have the ability to move up the rack, then you're going to want to see this point of obligation moved.","Paul, from my perspective, it's a very simple point of view. It is, you create a situation where the obligation and the point of compliance are two different points, and they shouldn't be. And so it's \u2013 by moving the point of obligation, obviously, we align the natural point of compliance with the natural point of obligation. And a lot of this speculation in the RINs market goes away. People will not be incentivized to build inventories of RINs to hold out for higher prices, to squeeze the shorts as we've seen. So anyway, I think I answered you, which -","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","You did. I think earlier in the call, Joe, you sort of said you thought it would be resolved. I guess, then subsequently you seem to be saying that you're not very good at predicting it and you're not sure what will come out in November.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","I think that it's going be resolved, but I do not know that it's going to happen before this election cycle happens. And then you tell me what the Obama administration's going to want to deal with between November and January. I can't predict that.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Something tells me it's not going to be RINs, Joe.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","(52:09).","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","If I could just ask about the CapEx. Actually you did define how much was growth, how much was maintenance. Are we assuming around $800 million of turnaround? I don't know if you said you didn't want to comment on that. I think that the guidance was originally maybe for $1 billion this year of turnaround and is being dropped. I'm sorry if I got the numbers wrong.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Typically, our turnaround expense is $700 million to $800 million on an annual basis.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, so that's what you'll be assuming for next year then?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think that's fair.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","That's great. And I just guess the final one would be, the net income target that you've talked about, the fact that you're sailing over that, why don't you look at it just purely from a cash point of view? Because you said that, because of the strength of cash, you're paying out more. Wouldn't it be smarter or easier for us all to just use a cash-on-cash dividend target? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, we feel like that the net income is very transparent. There's a lot of things that flow through the cash flow item like working capital items and such that you could have wild swings on your cash flow generation, and so our preference is net income.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. Can I have a final one?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Paul, that's four now. You'll get me in trouble here.","Unknown Speaker","Give him one more.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","While I've got Lane. Could you just talk about the recent draw on inventories that we've seen, Lane, and imports of crude? What's your perspective on that somewhat surprising series of draws that we've seen? And I'll leave it there, I promise. Thanks.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Hey, Paul. I'll have to defer to my friend here, Mr. Gary Simmons, on that.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. Paul, so I think you see these Brent TIR swinging back and forth, and so what we get into is that TI gets priced to where some barrels leave the Gulf and then the arb comes back in and incentivizes imports. So what we've seen is, we saw some barrels leaving the Gulf. It's kind of imbalanced today to where St. James is marginally getting to the point where you would want to import barrels again. So I think that's what you've seen in the crude markets.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Cool.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Chi.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi, Joe. I appreciate your legal and policy change focus on the RINs. But are you specifically implementing any strategies right now to reduce your RIN purchase obligation through increasing terminal exposure, changing commercial arrangements, or any other measure?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes. Yes to all of the above, and trying to continue to build the wholesale business. So we're looking at all those things. Those are the levers that we've got to pull, and then exports is the other one. And I think Gary and his team continue to look at the economics of exports with the RIN in mind, and so we're trying to manage our costs down every way we possibly can.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Does M&A focus on the midstream side? Is this a big priority, I guess, when you look at midstream growth position?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. No, it's a priority. Obviously, we've seen a lot of things transact here and we've looked at a lot of things. But it is a priority for us, Chi. I think we'd like to \u2013 again, as we said earlier in the call, we'd like to find assets in a perfect world that had third party volume and supported Valero's core business, but either\/or is good with us.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And then second question, your refining OpEx performance is pretty stellar. I imagine low gas \u2013 nat gas prices are a part of it, but I suspect there's probably more to that. Can you talk about the company's efforts on the cost front? Gulf Coast, you're trending at $3.50 a barrel, which is pretty amazing for your complexity there. And also North Atlantic, looks like you're way down on OpEx relative to the past few years. So any comments on that end would be helpful.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Chi, I'm just going to be \u2013 I'm going to answer this in general. It's a core value for us to manage our expenses aggressively all the time, but we do that in light of being very reliable. One of the tenets of our operation is we believe we get to a lower cost business by making sure that we implement our liability programs, so we minimize big one-time events that can turn into very expensive expense events. And that's essentially the way we think about running our business.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Is there something specific in the North Atlantic? Because it really looks like it's been measurable on the production.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","No.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Lane. Appreciate it.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Chi.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Sam.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","I wanted to go back to 2017 CapEx, if that's all right. The gated process to the capital program sort of sets up a possible scenario, where your growth CapEx number could be a lot lower than it has been this year or previous years or what you just mentioned for 2017. I guess, given the fact that the refining cycle has been challenging this year and it would have been hard for kind of people outside the fence to really easily identify a really good project in this kind of market. What is that \u2013 what would it take for the growth CapEx number to come down to a level that we haven't seen for a while? And then I guess that would introduce another list of possibilities on the return of cash side, and maybe if you could talk about how those two things are linked, too.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Do you want to talk about capital?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Sam, this is Lane. It's an interesting question. I wouldn't say that we have a complete shortcoming of potential projects. We have a strategic outlook, which we believe is we have \u2013 we believe that octane is going be in short supply going forward and we believe feedstock flexibility is something that we're always continuing to look at. I'm not going to say that there's not the possibility that somehow our growth CapEx will fall. But we have plenty of sort of small, fast hitting projects that compete in that space. You also got to remember, we have a strategic \u2013 we're strategically trying to get the right network (58:51) on our secondary costs through building those assets and dropping them into the MLP. And that's \u2013 as Mike alluded to earlier, that's about 50% of our growth CapEx for next year. So...","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, we \u2013 I mean, Sam, the fact that we're not out there talking about a bunch of capital projects just goes back to the fundamental principle that we're operating by, which was we don't talk about them until we're confident we're going to do the project. Again, we don't want to get out over our skis and over-commit, and then end up needing to back it down. So I don't think you should read anything into a lower capital number based on lack of opportunities that we're looking at.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, I guess, just following-up on a comment you made in the introduction about some positive signals you're seeing in U.S. unconventional upstream. The new crude units position you pretty well for that inflexion. I remember in the first quarter you gave a result for the first one. I think it was $30 million of EBITDA, which sort of put you right on the fairway of guidance. But production wasn't growing \u2013 at the time production was declining in the U.S. So at this point can you catch us up a little bit on the performance and sort of establish whether we have seen sort of, I guess, proof of concept in those projects by this point?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. So, Sam, this is Lane again. Our for funding, or FID (01:00:16) EBITDA for those projects, for Corpus it's $150 million and for Houston it was about $130 million. And so in the third quarter, they both per unit contributed about $45 million a piece. So you can sort of look at the run rate and they're clearly in line with what our funding decisions were with respect to \u2013 on the EBITDA basis.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Fernando Valle with Citi.","Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'll keep it brief. Just quickly on the change in regulations, IRS regulations for partnership liability and disguise sale, does that impact your plans for dropdowns into VLP for next year at all? Did you have any impact on previous drops into VLP? Thank you.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","It does not have any impact on the previous drops into the MLP. It's not retroactive and it really has no material impact on our plans, on the EBITDA, the amount of EBITDA that we have to drop.","Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. But do you expect a major impact as far as the potential tax liability for VLO on dropdowns? Or it doesn't really impact on -","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","No, it's not material to the tax liability that we're already incurring.","Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. It seems we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to John Locke for closing remarks.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Vanessa. Thanks everyone for calling today.

My name is Bakiba and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Ashley Smith. Mr. Ashley Smith, you may begin.","Ashley M. Smith","","Thank you, Bakiba. Good morning, welcome to our call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO, who will step down from the CEO position this Thursday; Joe Gorder, President and COO, who will become the CEO this Thursday; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Gene Edwards; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","Now, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC.","As noted in the release, we reported first quarter 2014 earnings of $828 million, or $1.54 per share. First quarter 2014 operating income improved over first quarter 2013, with gains in the refining and ethanol segments partly offset by a decrease in our former retail segment due to the spinoff of CST Brands in May 2013.","The refining segment throughput margin in the first quarter of 2014 was $10.90 per barrel, which is an increase of $0.31 per barrel versus the first quarter of 2013. Decreases in gasoline and distillate margins in most regions and WTI discounts in the Mid-Continent relative to Brent were more than offset by increases in light sweet and sour crude oil discounts in the U.S. Gulf Coast.","Also contributing to the higher throughput margin was our Quebec City refinery\u2019s increased consumption of cost-advantaged North American crude\u2019s in the first quarter. North American grades comprised 45% of the refinery\u2019s feedstock diet, up from 28% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and zero in the first quarter of 2013. This shows execution of our strategy to process more volumes of cost-advantaged North American crude.","For color on crude pricing, the shifting of U.S. Mid-Continent crude supplies from Cushing to the U.S. Gulf Coast as pipeline flow rates ramped up in the first quarter drove WTI discounts versus Brent to narrow by $9.15 per barrel, while LLS discounts to Brent widened by $5.39 per barrel as crude inventories built in the U.S. Gulf Coast between the first quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014.","Gulf Coast sour crude oil differentials to Brent also widened from the first quarter of 2013 to the first quarter of 2014 in response to the increasing supply of light sweet crude. The discounts for Mars and Maya relative to Brent increased by $4.10 per barrel and $8.76 per barrel, respectively.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.7 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 135,000 barrels per day versus the first quarter of 2013. Refining volumes were higher primarily due to less maintenance activity, which enabled the refineries to run at higher rates and capture margin.","Refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter of 2014 were $4.00 per barrel, which is $0.21 per barrel higher than the first quarter of 2013, due primarily to increased energy costs on higher natural gas prices.","I\u2019d like to highlight another item in our operations during the first quarter of 2014. The new hydrocrackers at Port Arthur and St. Charles ran well and at a combined feed rate of about 120,000 barrels per day, which is their stated capacity. The new hydrocrackers also contributed to an increase in yields of gasoline and distillates and a reduction in the yields of other lower-value products.","The ethanol segment delivered record first quarter earnings, generating $243 million of operating income versus $14 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2013. Increased gross margin was driven by weather-related supply disruptions, low industry ethanol inventories, low ethanol imports, and lower corn costs relative to the first quarter of 2013. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.1 million gallons per day in the first quarter of 2014, which is higher than first quarter 2013 but lower versus the fourth quarter of 2013 due to production slowdowns caused by weather-related rail congestion.","As noted in the earnings release, we acquired an idled 110 million gallon per year ethanol plant in Mount Vernon, Indiana, for $34 million in March. Efforts are underway to restart the facility, and production is expected to resume in the third quarter of this year. Given the favorable ethanol margin environment, we like the returns potential for this new facility.","General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $160 million in the first quarter of 2014. Net interest expense was $100 million, and total depreciation and amortization expense was $421 million. The effective tax rate was 33.9%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter-end, total debt was $6.6 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $3.6 billion of which $384 million was held by Valero Energy Partners LP. Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 14.3% excluding cash held by Valero Energy Partners.","Valero had approximately $5.4 billion and Valero Energy Partners had $300 million of available liquidity in addition to cash. Given our financial strength and favorable outlook for refining margin conditions last week S&P affirmed our BBB investment credit rating and raised our outlook from negative to stable.","Cash flows in the first quarter included $517 million of capital expenditures, which included $129 million for turn arounds and catalyst. In the first quarter, we return $359 million in cash to our stockholders by paying $133 million dividend and by purchasing approximately $4.3 million shares of Valero common stock for $226 million.","For 2014, we maintain our guidance for capital expenditures including turnaround and catalyst at approximately $3 billion. We expect stay-in business capital to account for approximately 50% of total spending and for the reminder to be allocated to strategic growth investments, which are primarily for logistics and light crude oil process and projects.","For modeling, our second quarter operations you should expect refinery group of volumes to fall with in the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.42 million to 1.47 million barrels per day, U.S. mid-continent at 370,000 to 390,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 260,00 to 280,00 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 420,000 to 440,000 barrels per day.","We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be around $4.20 per barrel, for our ethanol operations in the second quarter, we expect total production volumes of $3.5 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.40 per gallon which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization.","We expect G&A expense excluding depreciation for the second quarter to be around $160 million and net interest expense should be around $95 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter should be approximately $410 million and our effective tax rate should be around 35%.","Okay Bakiba, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment we\u2019ll open the call to questions. Just want to remind our callers that during this segment we would like to limit you each turn to questions. You can always jump back into the queue for additional questions. Okay Bakiba, we\u2019re ready.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). And our first question is going to come from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead your line is open.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys, good morning.","William R. Klesse","Good morning Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","When I looking at your buyback into first quarter is $226 million, in January from your last conference call you said $204 million. So when we looking at say in February and March, the decision that to slowdown the buyback, most there, can you help us understand what is the thinking? What is the criteria, when you determine that, how much you want to buyback?","William R. Klesse","","So this is Clark. We were basically out of the market in February, and March because of our pending management change, which our legal advice was we could not be up buying our stock and then in March because of the earnings, the whole period of February, March and then in the April here with the earnings. So we've really just been, in a way, blacked out or locked out of the market. There's no change in our strategy here. Returning cash to the shareholders, and our dividend, which we raised in January, and then buying our shares.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Second question (indiscernible) that I mean how fast do you guys want to grow the LP EBITDA or distribution growth you want to talk about during the initial year. I think that's two school of thought amongst some of your peers, one is that want to grow the LP as quickly as they could so that they would get to a size they can use their own balance sheet to raise that to fund future growth. The other school is that they want to be just in the high teen what is the school of thought that you guys belong.","Joseph W. Gorder","","Hey, Paul, this is Joe. If you look at our peer group in this, and we're really talking about the sponsored MLP's, we consider Phillips and Marathon to be the two, and you know, Phillips has said publicly they're going to grow their distribution to 20% to 25% range. Marathon is at a range slightly below that, we understand, and we tend to focus on the higher end of the range, so we're targeting 20%, 22%, 23%, distribution growth, annually going forward. And our approach will be do it, initially with drop down assets that are same type of assets that we did, when we did the initial assets in, which are those with very gradable, stable cash flows, based on fee based income. So we're going to target the timing for our first drop to be early part of the second half of this year. And then I would think, although we can't give that kind of direction, it should increase cash flows, and distribution increases should follow.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Joe, can we still assume that the MLP assets sitting in the C Corp. today is somewhere in the $300 million to $400 million for you?","Joseph W. Gorder","Paul, the range that we talk about is actually higher than that. I would say we're in the $800 million EBITDA range that we believe we could drop.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. And before I finish that Gene and Bill congratulation on the retirement thank you for all the years of your insight, we appreciate. And best of luck, and have a lot of fun. But don\u2019t spend too much time in the (indiscernible).","William R. Klesse","Thanks Paul.","","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question on the call from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead your line is open.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","William R. Klesse","Good morning, Roger.","","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Could we talk a little bit about Gulf Coast volumes here in the second quarter and then within that broader kind of expectation, generally speaking, volume has been better in the last two quarters, then I think kind of or at the higher end of the range of expectations, can you walk us through what's happening in the Gulf Coast and then maybe what could push that to the higher end of the range again.","","R. Lane Riggs","","This is Lane Riggs, are you asking in terms of our performance or the overall industries of Gulf Coast.","","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Specific to you.","William R. Klesse","Specific to us, when you look at sort of quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year, our turn around activity was lower, in the first quarter we set little bit higher in the second quarter. In terms of our volumes, that you'll see our second quarter volumes will be a little bit lower in terms of Gulf Coast, that we have a bigger turn around period. In terms of North American crude, the light crude processing that we have versus our capacity. We still have about a 165 a day versus our capacity that we could have run, and this was largely due that we have, you know, medium sour and heavy sour looks still quite competitive in the first quarter versus our capacity that we just still run about 165. Other than that, we are signaled to run forward or near sort of full as our availability would allow.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. Could you walk us through what the turnarounds are in the Gulf Coast in Q2 to the extent that you want to the specific units or type of work that\u2019s being done?","William R. Klesse","We choose not to disclose that until after the turnarounds, until the following quarter when the turnarounds are complete. The numbers are in terms of the overall volume metric they were actually the initial comments in terms of the guidance on the volume.","Michael S. Ciskowski","So what happened here is this is all legal advice and some of things that have happened in the markets. We\u2019ve changed our policy on this. I think some of you have noticed, so we no longer announce our turnarounds ahead of time. And so you just have to rely on the guidance that Ashley gives you as the volumes we\u2019re looking at.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","","Okay. Well as long as we know who to blame if it doesn't go other way it was supposed to go.","Michael S. Ciskowski","Well, blame Ashley.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","There you go. Just a last question here that, condensate we\u2019re hearing to lot more about that becoming a bigger and bigger issue and even in some parts of West Texas where it's being rejected. I was wondering, what are you seeing along the Gulf Coast or any other part of your operations, in terms of condensate. Are you having any rejection issues, in terms of what's being delivered to the units and then what your thoughts are on, how Valero may deal with the condensate issue not worrying so much about, you know, the industry with condensate splitters, et cetera.","Gary Simmons","Hey, Roger, this is Gary Simmons. I would say in the Gulf we haven't had too much of an issue with getting light material to our crude units. We have taken a hard look at the condensate. We don't really see that the discounts are wide enough to really warrant a capital investment to be able to run a lot larger volumes of condensates in the Gulf Coast. We are taking a heavy look at this in the Permian basin in some regions and kind of getting with producers and seeing where they're seeing the production to see if there is some opportunity, but right now we don't have anything planned.","Roger D. Read \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And then our next question is going to come from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead your line is open.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning guys. And firstly congratulate to Bill and Eugene and your careers and retirement to Joe and the new role to come May. My first question really for Bill, and it's obviously more general and somewhat reflective question. I mean as you think about your 40 plus year career with Valero, and it\u2019s predecessors and lot has changed and how do you think about the current Valero and how it stacks up, relative to your history, and just your outlook today for the company versus other periods of time?","William R. Klesse","","Okay. Well, the independents are a bigger segment of the business today than it used to be for sure, and I think that will continue. So that's one of the major changes in refining is that the independent segment has far more weight, and I think we react quicker to market influences. But Valero, we\u2019re a company that\u2019s put together bunch of assets and a bunch of people. Some of those assets were under invested in some were operated very poorly. But we come together with one culture and we have one goal, and it\u2019s really to perform with excellence.","We\u2019ve improved our operations tremendously over the last few years, we\u2019re a for more reliable operators are much, much better operator, in that thanks goes to our people being very focused on excellence, respect for each other, hard work, safety, and teamwork.","Valero is one company and you knowing our history, all the acquisitions, but we\u2019re one company. This business, though, far it's going to continue to be volatile, it will be seasonal, but it\u2019s made up a very hard working people and I always like the point this out to people, this industry pays taxes and we give a product to society that makes peoples lives better.","The world needs the oil and gas for regardless of the rhetoric that people talk about. Oil and gas is inexpensive, and it, I mean, frankly, the developing world has have oil and gas. All the alternatives, and we know them all and we know all the cost structures, and except for ethanol, that has been able to work into the fuel mix all the rest of these alternatives are too expensive, inefficient, and will do absolutely nothing to improve the environment. And it's a waste of money.","Well, I think we're very competitive very well, competitively positioned, and we had value to society, and Valero has a very bright future and no question that the crude oil and natural gas that\u2019s happening in North America is the biggest thing in my career, and I'm sure in Gene's as well, and its having a tremendous influence on all manufacturing in the United States that people thought was really last forever because the jobs in our industry really do allow people to on their own educate their kids and retire with benefits.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","That\u2019s great. I have a second question. There is a current debate regarding the impact of current battery, crude inventories are well above five year highs and a continuing heavy turnaround through the second quarter of this year and just how fold the system might be as it relates to Gulf Coast crude differentials.","I know batteries are big place, I was wondering if you comment on what you\u2019re seeing in the physical inventory market. I know you have talked on the conversation side, but how many tank tops are general inventory levels that you\u2019re seeing in various Gulf Coast storage reasons, I'll leave it at that. Thanks.","Gary Simmons","David this is Gary Simmons. If you look at the BOE stats from last week, we\u2019re 209 million when we combined the refinery tankage with third-party terminals we would say that the working capacity in the Gulf is somewhere in the 2.75 range so that puts you about 76% of overall working capacity that\u2019s being utilized today.","We\u2019re not seeing problems in the Gulf and there are some areas that it does appears starting to get pretty full with the SPR release loop seems pretty full, one of the things that we\u2019re seeing is our barrels are showing up faster than they used to. So the third-party terminal operators aren\u2019t sitting on inventory. They\u2019re turning those barrels pretty fast, and they\u2019re showing up it our refineries sites a little bit faster than what we\u2019ve seen in the past, but no real issues that we\u2019ve seen thus far.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Great, I appreciate it guys.","Gary Simmons","Thanks Evan.","Operator","Thank you, and then our next question is going to come from Edward Westlake from Credit-Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Yes and let me also say congratulations, 650 I think is the EPS consensus not quite the $8 you guys did in the boom times, but certainly Valero looks like in good shape, just a follow on question on the MLP. I mean, obviously it\u2019s a great currency as well not just for what you can drop down into it, trading at a 2% yield. Maybe think a little bit more broadly about talking to us about what you envisage the MLP to allow you to do over the next several years, potentially external M&A as well as the drop down. Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder","","Yes. Okay, this is Joe. It\u2019s a good question. I mean, obviously the drop downs are the primary focus for the strategy in the short-term, but we do realize that we\u2019ve got a very competitive currency to use to do other transactions. You know, I think if you look at the logistics investment that Valero is making this year, and it will continue to make next year. In docks, we even have the rails, we\u2019ve got pipe investments that we\u2019re making and looking at. We\u2019re going to continue to build the logistics portfolio at Valero Energy that will allow us to look to drop for an extended period of time, which really just eliminates the need to go into the market to pay a premium for assets.","So we find that to be a great benefit to us, but we would not hesitate to look at what\u2019s available in the marketplace, and to consider those assets and to use the currency to acquire those assets, but we felt that they fit into the system, and they were really assets that Valero Energy felt good about being able to make commitments to provide in that ratable, cash flow stream going forward.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then a specific question on \u2013 and condensate has been team so far this call, but say you look at your sort of more mid-continent refineries Ardmore and Mckee, as you look at the crude that\u2019s coming into those refineries, presume say it\u2019s, WTI mix a lot of refineries are starting to complain that WTI isn\u2019t the same WTI used to be, because obviously condensates are spiked into it. Do you have any color on o how the sort of gravity of that WTI has changed over time or where we are against the sort of 42 API speck","Unidentified Company Representative","","Yes. I would say both Ardmore and Mckee, we definitely see a trend toward the crude getting lighter and it has caused some operating issues for us, some constraints where we have to cut rates, because the gravity of the crude is getting higher. So we try to control at the best we can with working with producers to control the quality of the barrels that we\u2019re getting, but we have seen issues with the barrels getting lighter.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","I mean, I guess I\u2019ll ask the direct I should have asked, which is do you think there will be a point where the really light crude will need its own infrastructure rather than being blended into the TI stream.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes, I do I think ultimately we\u2019ll have to do that because the refineries just can reject the light ends.","Unidentified Company Representative","But how that structure comes out remains to be seen, I\u2019m not necessarily sure you\u2019re going to see a gathering system, but you may see some type of fractionation that occurs that allows it to move from the field economically into these hubs and then get address that hub before it then moves to the refiners. There\u2019s a lot, but just think that there is - you wouldn't necessarily think you're going to have a whole pipeline network to handle this, but you may have fractionation occur at different places in the system, including at the refinery.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes. Which would be an opportunity for you guys in the MLP?","William R. Klesse","That\u2019s right.","Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead. You line is open.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Good morning. It\u2019s Jeff Dietert.","William R. Klesse","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Good morning. My congratulations to Bill and Gene and appreciate all you education and knowledge and being an industry statement for the last many years. I\u2019d like to focus on some of the medium sour crudes on the Gulf Coast. I think there have been a lot of discussion about light crudes coming in and more competition between light and medium. Yet, when you look at the Ed Mars, it's trading 5.5 under LLS, which is wider than average over the last 18 months.","And you look at Thunder Horse, Southern Green Canyon some of that medium sours and trading at nice discounts as well. Obviously, the 700 a day keystone south pipeline is started up and we have got SPR putting medium crude into the market. Could you talk about how significant of these factors are and maybe other considerations you believe are driving the wide discounts from medium crudes in the Gulf Coast, and maybe how sustainable that weakness will be.","William R. Klesse","Yes. So I think we\u2019ve been fairly consistent in our view that\u2019s you know the medium sours and the heavy sours are going to have to trade at a quality adjusted differentials to the light sweet and as the light sweets are pressured down, the medium sours and the heavy sours are going to have to follow. I agree with your comments certainly in the short-term, the medium sours followed with the SBR release pressured the medium sours down in the Gulf a little bit more than what we had seen especially in the first quarter. But overall, I think we'll see that trend continued.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","And your LP's are viewing that you should run near maximum rates, given where discounts are, and crack spreads are and just looking at the high levels of inventory reasonable U.S. demand and increasing product exports?","William R. Klesse","Yes, I think as Lane commented, the LP's are really pushing toward maximum utilization across the system.","Jeff A. Dietert \u2013 Simmons & Co. International","Thanks for your comments.","William R. Klesse","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is on the call from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead Paul. Your line is open.","Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, good morning everyone.","William R. Klesse","Good morning, Paul.","Paul L. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Bill and Joe congratulations indeed to both of you, and again as always I said, thanks for being so much fun to deal with over the years and so interesting to deal with. Could we just talk a bit about Gulf Coast again sorry to go back to this, but the throughput number could you just remind me what that was in terms of what you expected to be in the second quarter could you just repeat for to make it easier what you did in the first quarter and then could you also talk about what your capacity is now on the Gulf Coast, what you think your refining throughput capacity is overall. Thanks.","","William R. Klesse","Yes, Paul. In the first quarter our throughput was 1.585 billion barrels per day. Our guidance was one for the second quarter is 1.42 million to 1.47 million barrels per day. And I'm going to get an updated capacity. Capacities is around a total throughput, just over 1.6 million barrels per day.","Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Okay, so I\u2019ve got that 1.6 and then I think it was officially 1.54 last year and then so it\u2019s to be so detailed here, but then I think you gave a light weep throughput capacity as well for that system.","R. Lane Riggs","","Yes. This is Lane Riggs. Just in the Gulf Coast it\u2019s about 480,000 barrels a day.","Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","For you guys?","R. Lane Riggs","Yes.","","Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Yes, okay that\u2019s interesting. The outlook for that as we move forward. Firstly, I guess that\u2019s a turn around number in Q4 that\u2019s the reason why you are so much lower, but then I suppose that we are going to go back up to much higher level of utilization through the rest of the year Q3, Q4. And then when we move forward beyond that, is your capacity going to increase let\u2019s say into 2015 or do you think you\u2019ve reached a steady state. Firstly for the overall capacity, second for the light sweep? Thanks. Sorry to miss the detail.","R. Lane Riggs","Yes, Paul this is Lane again, we have the two crude unit project. So everything you said is true. But in terms of project we have in terms of our pipeline of project is our crude expansion for both Corpus Christi and Houston both of which will be somewhat finished towards the end of next year. So the capacity of those 90,000 barrels a day at Houston and 70,000 barrels of day in Corpus in terms of our additional capacity in the Gulf Coast were on light sweep.","Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","And that would be at the end of 2015?","William R. Klesse","Yes, we\u2019re calling kind of early 2016. So when those are operating.","Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. And then the other question I have here is just related to the further outlet light sweep crude in terms of exports, can you just, again on a look forward basis talk about how much more oil you guys would be using in Canada and there is some line reversal stories as well as some shipping stories, thanks.","William R. Klesse","Yeah, so what we said is our Canadian refinery should be at a 100% domestic light sweep by the end of the year, we\u2019re still on pace to complete that, we\u2019re a little bit ahead of schedule, I would probably have about a 130,000 barrels a day of capacity that we haven\u2019t utilized yet for the domestic light sweet. So if you take Lane\u2019s number in the gulf of 165 in the gulf plus 138 back here in this 295 range of capacity that we still have to absorb light sweet crude absence the capital program that we have.","Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Well, understood. And is that the limit on what you can do absent the capital program I mean the only crew that you\u2019ll take up that is for your own use and your own refinery?","William R. Klesse","So I guess I don\u2019t understand which you are asking?","R. Lane Riggs","Well you may and we can ship out there and sell it to one of the other refineries in Canada?","Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, exactly whether\u2026","R. Lane Riggs","Our permit allows us to ship it to all four, I think of the company arriving and compensate with somebody else, I think it\u2019s four anyway.","Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. And I guess additional final one and Bill, because it\u2019s presumably your last call, if you want to talk about how things have changed and or you think the outlook is in Washington D.C. Particularly I\u2019m wondering if you think will be able to export, condensate in relatively short order and then longer term, whether you feel that in due course potentially if prices in the U.S. get very low, we maybe exporting crude as well and any other thoughts you have on what\u2019s going on in Washington? Thanks.","R. Lane Riggs","Well I do accept that the ground work is being laid for condensates to be an issue and that\u2019s all definition of what crude oil is and then the question was asked earlier about infrastructure, which is absolutely correct. So condensates may need to get addressed at some point. As far as exporting of crude, though, the industry is running the oil, the discounts we have in the marketplace today are really because of logistics in many of these markets. And we\u2019re doing things and I\u2019m sure everyone of our peer group are doing things to be able to run more oil, and then we support the free markets, but you need to remember that this business isn't very free.","There\u2019s a lots of restrictions from the Jones Act and the cartels, to everything else that goes with it. So I think it remains to be seen, but under the law, there's a lot of flexibility. You can re-export Canadian crude, you can get licenses for that, as Gary just spoke, you have licenses to send U.S. domestic crude to Canada, there is also possibilities of exchanges, if it becomes so much, but the thing I think that people need to remember is this is a windfall for the North America and the United States as far as manufacturing, whether it's natural gas liquids, natural gas or crude oil, and we can have a manufacturing boom, the petrochemical industry can boom, where do you build petrochemical plants.","Resource advantage, consumer advantage the U.S. is now resource advantaged. So this is a huge opportunity for jobs. We have a lot of rhetoric about jobs. Here is a real area for jobs. Job training, huge opportunities for welders, pipe fitters, instrument techs, operators, that was not here just five years ago. So this question of exports, and how our country should conduct themselves especially when you see the turmoil in the world, that we have going on, I think should take a lot of stuff. And I think it will.","Paul I. Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research LLC","Great, thanks for your thoughts. Thank you guys.","William R. Klesse","","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","","Thank you, and then our next question is going to come from Faisel Kahn from Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Thanks. Hi, good morning guys. I\u2019m Faisel from Citi. If I could ask a question on the heavy oil sort of consumption in the Gulf Coast, just with all the things going on in Venezuela, what are the risks to you guys the volumes into your facilities, from heavy crude, you're taking from Venezuela and then to sort of counter that can you give us an update on how much heavy crude you're bringing down from Canada specifically through the pipeline into Port Arthur as well.","Michael S. Ciskowski","Yes, our heavy sour volumes were fairly consistent from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. You brought up Venezuela, we did choose to allow our heavy sours inventories to creep up a little bit in the first quarter. In case we had a supply disruption from Venezuela. But we haven't seen any changes that would indicate that we would have a risk of supply loss from Venezuela. The Canadian values \u2013 Canadian volumes were down in the first quarter and that was mainly just a matter of pricing.","The Canadian production \u2013 the heavy Canadian production was down somewhat due to weather and then demand was also a little higher with BP Whiting\u2019s coker coming online. So we didn\u2019t see the economic incentive to run the Canadians in the first quarter that we have seen in the fourth quarter and early. That incentive is starting to come back and so we are ramping the Canadians back into Port Arthur here in April.","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Its okay, understood. And can you also give us an update on what your strategic thinking is with the California assets, has that changed at all, and here what\u2019s the \u2013 process going on or, how are you guys thinking about those particular assets?","William R. Klesse","","Well. In California obviously our financial performance is not that great. It is our weakest group of assets now financially, operationally though it\u2019s excellent. We have a very solid asset, they are operated very well. We continue to make improvements on those assets. And so when you look at the basic issue of supply demand where demand has not really recovered out there at all from pretty great recession, although we're starting to some improving economy and some optic in demand.","To focus that we have is to work on our crude costs and to continue to work on the operating costs and of course, adjusting our yields to fit the market. So we view it as some of our competitors publicly stated that in a way, it's an option value out there. It's a huge market. The LA basin is still absolutely a huge gasoline market, and so the markets there, we just needed to show a little bit of growth back to levels it was before.","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Okay, understood. And then last question for me. Can you give us an update on the methanol plan to alkylation unit projects and sort of when you might think of sort of sanctioning those projects?","R. Lane Riggs","Hi, this is Lane Riggs, where we are \u2013 we're in the Phase II and Phase III process in terms of working on ethanol, which means were doing a more detailed engineering to get a better cost of fine tuner economics, we will bring the project forward for a Phase III review, around November this year, and we'll probably have sort no go on the project at that time, but so far the project looks very, very favorable until there is no show stopper at this point time with respect to that project","Faisel H. Khan \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Okay, great. I appreciate the time guys.","William R. Klesse","","Hey thanks Faisel.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is from the Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody, Bill, Joe and everybody congratulations. It\u2019s you have been agree educator build for the industry and will miss you at the grantee for sure. But good luck to all of you. My two questions if I may, first of all on the Gulf Coast, I think Lane made a comment earlier, but well refinery utilization, but I don\u2019t would like to go to the industry utilization.","We have seen the big build in inventories, but we have also seen our step changing utilization rates and as I look at it, if you want to characterize it, our supply days of crude on the Gulf Coast, are actually near the lowest level seasonally, that we have seen in quite some times. And this one if you guys could comment on that. And what it means for working capital for the industry and for Valero specifically as you move through utilization rates higher on the Gulf Coast. I got have follow-up. Please?","R. Lane Riggs","Well. This is Lane. And I will take a little bit of short at as days of supply I will differ to my friend list, but in terms of we absolutely had a, if you look at our crude margins, from the LP guide. We have had a huge incentive, to run through all the first quarter and fully with the margin refineries exist today so if you want turnaround or if you are having issues, you're trying to run crude, and you are not only trying to crude and crude still for example we are running crude in some of our SPC's, two or three of our SPC's where we have the ability to run resin, we are running crude in all of that so the industry is doing quite a bit in terms of trying to run more crude, because that\u2019s where the economic people\u2019s are telling us the range and I don\u2019t know if you want to talk on employees.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes, so the days is hard working capital in general \u2013 we generally see our domestic refineries that are taking ratable pipeline deliveries require less working capital than some of our Gulf Coast assets and our view was as we switch to more domestic barrels that would drive down working capital, I\u2019m not sure I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell that, and some of its just we're not sure what our pipeline line fill capacities are going to be on some of these new lines to be able to really give you guidance on that at this time.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","I guess sort on what I\u2019m really trying to figure out is I mean \u2013 but all looking at the differential on the Gulf Coast there has been obviously a consensus expectation that was going to blow out again probably for all of us and it hasn\u2019t at least in the magnitude in prior quarters we\u2019ve had down time. And I guess what I\u2019m really trying to understand is are you guys seeing the same sort of indications that we are, which is that days of supply for the system as a whole, is actually still quite tight given the higher utilization rates or are you not seeing that at all?","Unidentified Company Representative","It appears to me that the market in the Gulf is well supplied today. So I don\u2019t know that I have actually looked at it in terms of days of supply, but the market seems well supplied.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. My follow-up really hopefully quick, one more Valero specific. The comment you made earlier about you are seeing a lightening of the crude slate or for WTI specifically and that's becoming more problematic I guess in terms of filling up some of your secondary units. Can you talk about what that's doing to you\u2019re capture rates relative to the legacy capture rate of the system. I guess what I\u2019m really trying to get to is, we\u2019ve seen capture rates drift a little bit lower versus indicators and I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s got something to do with it in terms of incremental challenges you are having on running those crudes and I\u2019ll leave it there.","Unidentified Company Representative","","It\u2019s difficult for me to comment exactly with that does in terms of running lighter in terms of where the capture rates go we could look at that in more detail.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","I\u2019ll take it off-line thanks guys.","Unidentified Company Representative","","Thanks Doug.","Operator","","Thank you, and then our next question is going to come from Sam Margolin from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thanks, good morning everybody. I\u2019ll just echo the congrats to Bill, Gene and Joe not a whole lot I could add, but I would be remised if I didn\u2019t say thanks and I think its going to continue to be\u2026","Unidentified Company Representative","Hey, Sam. You may have to rejoin because we are hearing some weird feedback coming through.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen and Company","Is it better now?","Unidentified Company Representative","Every time you do it, it sounds like you are playing a videogame.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen and Company","Really?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah, yeah. You might have to rejoin we\u2019ll wait for you.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen and Company","Okay, thanks.","Operator","","And our next question is going to come from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead your line is open.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Guys, good morning hopefully you can hear me a little bit better.","Unidentified Company Representative","It sounds good Blake.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay good. Congrats also to Bill, Gene and Joe, its great working with all you guys. Two quick ones for you. One, you mentioned the Quebec refinery and potential reversals of line nine, of course I know you are barging Eagle Ford crude up there as well. I\u2019m just curious if you could talk abut how you see the economics unfolding, I guess I always viewed pipeline as more efficient than barging crude, although I believe you kind of outlined about $2 cost of barging on a non-Jones Act vessel. So I\u2019m just curious once the. line comes on, do you think we'll start or maybe reduce the amount of the Eagle Ford barge crude up there?","Gary K. Simmons","","Yes. This is Gary Simmons. I guess the way we would see it is that the pipeline delivery would be the most advantaged and then second to that would be the barrels that we get over the water, and then finally would be the tranche that were currently taking by rail. So if barrels starts to drop off it would probably be the rail volume that you would see fall off before the volume that we are taking over the water.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay, great. The second one for you quickly there is some press reports out there that the Milford Haven refinery will be closed next month, obviously you\u2019ll get a direct benefit of Pembroke with those volumes being offline, but I\u2019m just curious if there is any opportunity to maybe buy some units or specific assets from that facility that would enhance Pembroke\u2019s performance?","William R. Klesse","Well, this is Klesse, we\u2019re fully aware of what\u2019s going on there and we are not sure how this is all going to work out and if there is an opportunity for us to improve our situation at Pembroke will take a look at it, but as of today we don\u2019t have anything moving on direct.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Michael S. Ciskowski","Thanks, Blake.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chi Chow for Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you. I want to go back to the Canadian strategy, and it\u2019s been reported you\u2019ve got this application for re-export license of Canadian crude. And first have you receive that permit yet and then secondly can you just discuss the strategy with the permit and what\u2019s the strategy on moving volumes out to either backup by if I guess to Qu\u00e9bec or out of Pembroke from what I understand that\u2019s part of permit as well.","Gary K. Simmons","Yes, this is Gary Simmons, we do have the permit in place, some of that why we went out and got that, actually when we are having the weather problems moving the Canadian barrels by rail to Qu\u00e9bec, we wanted to be able to shift that volume and move the rail volume to the gulf and then be able to bring it up over the water to Qu\u00e9bec, and weren\u2019t allow to do that. So this permit will allow us to do that, certainly at some point in time that we could also look at taking volume to Pembroke, but today we don\u2019t have any plans to do that least in the short term.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","Does the permit allow you specifically to move to Pembroke only or that open to destinations within Europe or the U.K.?","Gary K. Simmons","I\u2019m not sure on the specific for that.","Michael S. Ciskowski","I think in the permit, you actually identified and I believe or you have nine different places were allowed to take it in the permit and you actually have to specify and so you asked the philosophy or strategy question, the strategy is that flexibility. We have the assets going in place with rail and at the U.S. gulf coast that allows us to keep the crude oil and that allow us to plan to go ahead and keep it segregated and then if the economics so there we have flexibility in our system.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","Okay, Bill that the nine different places are they all with in your own facilities at Valero?","Michael S. Ciskowski","No, there are not.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","I\u2019m just wondering is in our your best interest to keep as much crude in the gulf as possible and what point would you look to I guess execute on this part and moving the crude down?","Michael S. Ciskowski","It\u2019s all flexibility and this is about economics and we would do exactly what years have leading to is always in our self interest for our shareholder.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then I guess second question, can you give us the product export volumes in the first quarter and what the capacity is for both gas and diesel at this point.","Gary K. Simmons","","Sure, this is Gary Simmons again in the first quarter we exported 208,000 barrels of distillate. We would say that our capacity the day is close to 325 and we have some capital projects in the work that will bring that up to 425 on the gasoline side we exported a 124,000 barrels a day of gasoline in the first quarter and that capacity is probably in the 225 range it will also go up to about 250 with some of the dock work we have going on.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks Gary, any timing on the increase in the capacity on both products.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes, so the dock work is probably a year to two years away from being complete.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","Okay and then one final question on the exports have you noticed any impact from some of the new refineries that have coming to the market and most notably I guess that you\u2019ve well planned in Saudi Arabia.","Gary K. Simmons","We\u2019ll still see a margin today a good margin to export when you take the RIN into account and so we were finding plenty of homes to take the barrel. So I don\u2019t say that, I can\u2019t say that we\u2019ve seen a big impact from that.","Chi Chow \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","","Okay, great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is going to come from Sam Margolin Cowen & Company. Please go ahead your line is open.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, coming through okay.","William R. Klesse","Sounds good.","Joseph W. Gorder","Great.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for let me back I\u2019ll keep it tight I wanted to, I think that was brought up earlier the connection between sort of utilization and capture rate I think one of the moving parts there might be intermediate feedstock costs, seems to be like one of the last remaining sort of structural challenges I bring it up because you guys are addressing it with crude units and I was just curious of if any of those economics are changing if there is an opportunity at this stage to make them bigger or add another one or even drop them down and put a toll on it because kind of the commodity structure is looking more favorable?","R. Lane Riggs","","Hi, Sam this is Lane Riggs so our both crude units, that we did we are big as \u2013 as large that could be in enter the green house gas. So we don\u2019t really have the opportunity to make them larger at this point time about reporting without going through the process to getting the green house gas.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, and then I guess I will just bring up Maya, Brent spreads have been pretty favorable I think some of that has to do with WTS and Midlands kind of I guess leakage of the price dislocations there and West pipelines the infrastructure start to come online at a West Texas and maybe Midland normalizers closer to, closer to other benchmarks and then WTS comes with it if you guys are expecting any kind of weird price action in Maya maybe in the third quarter and if there is something we should prepare or try to bake in ahead a time to our estimates.","Michael S. Ciskowski","","Well, I think with the Maya formula there is always that risk that if Midland comes into Cushing that it can affect that Maya formula in the short-term but we believe they\u2019re trying to price their crude so it can be competitive with Mars and so that even if Midland comes in they would eventually adjust the K to keep their crude competitive with a medium seller alternative.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you so much. Have a good one.","Michael S. Ciskowski","Thanks Sam.","Operator","","Thank you. Then our next question is going to come from Cory Garcia from Raymond James. Please go ahead Cory your line is open.","Cory J. Garcia \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Thanks good morning Bill, definitely want to echo everyone start and that\u2019s what it is going forward for Bill and Gene. Most of my questions have already been answered. But I guess as follow up to Faisel earlier Lane do you have any sort of no go, no go timeline on the Al key unit that you guys as talked about, obviously, a little bit lower stop in the scale of project, but just wondering if you have a similar sort of training for us to at least keep an eye out for.","R. Lane Riggs","It's on a similar time line. We'll have the same sort of base to review in the fourth quarter with management and then make to sort of the similar decision.","Cory J. Garcia \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time.","","William R. Klesse","","So listen, for those of you have a still on the call, and it was mentioned several times, this is Gene and my last call with you all. And I just wanted to Gene and I both wanted to tell you guys. Thank you very much for the interest you\u2019ve shown in Valero and we wish all of you all the best going forward.

My name is Yolanda, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Locke. You may begin.","John Locke","Good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Now I will turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks.","Joe Gorder","Well, thanks John, and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter and full year 2015 were really great for Valero. We operated safely and reliably achieving our lowest ever employee injury rate in refining and reaching an annual average refinery utilization rates of 95%. The markets were favorable during the quarter. Domestic product demand grew supported by lower pump prices and sour crude discounts relative to Brent were attractive to our highly complex refining system.","While distillate margins were pressured during unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillate demand in Latin America remained robust. In fact we exported record volumes of distillate and gasoline in the fourth quarter. We continue to execute well in our projects. In the quarter, we successfully commissioned the new Corpus Christi crude unit, the Port Arthur gas oil hydrocracker expansion and the McKee crude unit expansion.","Our Quebec City refinery also began receiving crude via Enbridge\u2019s Line 9B. We exercised our option with Plains All American to acquire a 50% interest in the Diamond crude oil pipeline project. Once completed this project will connect Cushing with Memphis and provide us with crude optionality and long-term cost savings versus sourcing crude oil from St. James.","Additionally, Valero Energy Partners continue to execute its growth strategy and Valero GP\u2019s interest in VLP reached the high splits with the distribution increase we announced earlier this week. We also continued to advance our refining growth strategy. Construction of the Houston crude unit remains on schedule with start-up planned in the second quarter of 2016. And earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved the Houston Appalachian project. This project is estimated to cost $300 million and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019.","And finally regarding cash returns to stockholders, we paid out 80% of our 2015 adjusted net income exceeding the 75% annual payout target. Further demonstrating our belief of Valero\u2019s earnings potential, last week our Board of Directors approved a 20% increase in the regular quarterly dividend $.60 per share or $2.40 annually.","With that John, I\u2019ll hand it back over to you.","John Locke","Okay, thank you Joe. Moving on to the results, we reported fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net income from continuing operations of $862 million or $1.79 per share versus $952 million or $1.83 per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. Actual net income from continuing operations was $298 million or $0.62 per share, which compares to $1.2 billion or $2.22 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts as shown in the financial tables that accompany our release. For 2015, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion or $9.24 per share compared to $3.5 billion or $6.68 per share for 2014. Actual net income from continuing operations was $4 billion or $7.99 per share in 2015 versus $3.7 billion or $6.97 per share in 2014.","Fourth quarter 2015 refining segments adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion was in line with the fourth quarter of 2014. Stronger gasoline and other product margins combined with higher refining throughput volumes were offset by lower distillate and petrochemical margins and lower discount for sweet crude oils relative to Brent crude oil.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day which was 34,000 barrels per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Our refineries operated at 97% throughput capacity utilization in the fourth quarter of 2015. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.47 per barrel were $0.29 per barrel lower than the fourth quarter of 2014, largely driven by favorable property tax settlements and reserve adjustments and lower energy cost.","The Ethanol segment generated $37 million of adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $154 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 due primarily to lower gross margin per gallon driven by a decline in ethanol prices versus relatively stable corn prices.","For the fourth quarter of 2015, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation were $206 million and net interest expense was $107 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $494 million and the effective tax rate was 28% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate was lower than expected due primarily to a reduction in the statutory tax rate in the United Kingdom and the settlement of income tax audits in the United States.","With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $7.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.1 billion, of which $81 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 20%. We have a $5.6 billion of available liquidity excluding cash. The cash flows in the fourth quarter included $732 million of capital investments, of which $164 million was for turnarounds and catalysts, and $136 million was for our investment in the Diamond pipeline.","For 2015 capital investment included $1.4 billion for stay-in business and $1 billion for growth. We returned $1 billion in cash for our stockholders in the fourth quarter which included $240 million in dividend payment and $767 million for the purchase of $11.1 million shares of Valero common stock. For 2015 we purchased 44.9 million shares for $2.8 billion. For 2016, we maintain our guidance of $2.6 billion for capital investments including turnarounds catalyst, joint venture and strategic investments. This consists of approximately $1.6 billion for stay-in business and $1 billion for growth.","For modeling our first quarter operations we expect throughout volumes to fall within the following ranges. US Gulf Coast at 1.61 million to 1.66 million barrels per day, US Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day, US West Coast at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day, and North Atlantic at 465,000 to 485,000 barrels per day.","We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $3.85 per barrel. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash cost, such as depreciation and amortization.","We expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation for the first quarter to be around a $175 million and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $470 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 32%.","That concludes our opening remarks. Now before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request the callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their questions which are also important. If you have more than two questions please rejoin the queue as time permits.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Your line is open.","Blake Fernandez","Guys, good morning. Just a quick question on the alkylation unit. First, can you provide any kind of return expectations that you have for the project? And then secondly on the spending profile, it looks like your CapEx guidance in the 2016 is about the same as it was before. So, I\u2019m just kind of confirming that most of the spending probably is weighted towards 2017 and 2018?","Lane Riggs","Well, hey, Blake, this is Lane. Yes, the Board approved the alkylation unit [normally] [ph] about $300 million, the [indiscernible] EBITDA is about $105 million, if you use 2015 prices it would be about $140 million EBITDA. With respect to the budget we, when you look at our original - when we gave out the 2016 guidance on our budget for this year two years ago, it\u2019s up about a $100 million and it\u2019s normally the Port Arthur turnaround. We have little more turnaround than we had in our outlook was two years ago, but certainly and then all the rest of it, the alky is clearly fitting inside our $100 billion a year strategic capital, it\u2019s normally about $100 million a year and it is back-weighted like you said towards 2017 and 2018.","Blake Fernandez","Okay, Lane. Secondly, just maybe if you don\u2019t mind sharing some thoughts around light heavy spreads into 2016 and I guess what I am thinking especially in light of Iranian barrels coming to market that could potentially displace some other barrels globally, seems like maybe that would have an indirect benefit to Valero given your - given your leverage to Gulf Coast in heavy processing?","Gary Simmons","Yes. Blake, this is Gary Simmons, you know overall, yes, we\u2019ve seen very good spreads between the medium sours and light and heavy sours as well. And certainly the Iranian production coming online will put further pressure on those differentials. I think we see several things in the market, you know the increase in OPEC productions, putting medium sour barrels into the Gulf. You see Gulf of Mexico deep-water medium sour production rising at the same time we\u2019re seeing some of the light sweet production falling off here in the United States so it\u2019s leading to very good differentials.","I think the other thing that you know, a fundamental shift is where fuel oil had been trading around 80% of Brent, it\u2019s now trading around 60% of Brent, which should mean that, we would expect to see good medium sour and heavy sour differential throughout the year. I think the other thing for us, the Iranian production, of course we won\u2019t be running any of those barrels, but we do think the market rebalances and make some additional heavy and medium grades available to us from Latin America.","Blake Fernandez","Great, thanks for the color, Gary. I appreciate it guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Neil Mehta","Hey, good morning.","Joe Gorder","Good morning, Neil.","Neil Mehta","So Joe and Gary, you guys have a unique window into what\u2019s happening from a product demand perspective, it\u2019s one of the big debates in the oil markets right now. Can you talk about what the export markets look like from your perspective for diesel and gasoline, and then to piggy back off of that, you\u2019ve seen four weeks now of these gasoline builds in the [BOEs] [ph], is that consistent with what you\u2019re seeing on the ground?","Gary Simmons","Yes, Neil, this is Gary. I think we continue to see very good export demand for our products, as Joe mentioned we had record volumes in the fourth quarter, we continue to see good demand for both distillate and gasoline abroad. Our rack volumes remain very strong; we\u2019re moving a lot of products over the racks, have seen good domestic demand for our product as well. Certainly, I think when you get this early in the year it\u2019s kind of hard to dissect the [BOE] [ph] data, we\u2019ve seen large builds as well, some of the data does look a little suspect.","I think we\u2019ve seen a lot of weather issues in the Gulf, that our belief may have been that it hindered some of the waterborne barrels from being able to leave due to fog and weather that we have had in the Gulf. The Mississippi River flooding also has hindered some of the refiners along the river, their ability to clear those barrels as well. I think we\u2019re just too early to really get a good view of what demand\u2019s going to look like, but everything from us, our perspective looks good.","Joe Gorder","Yes. The fundamentals I think for strong demand are still there. There is no question about that, I mean we continue to have prices that are very attractive at the street and then there is a lot of data that\u2019s coming out recently on vehicle miles traveled being up and also on, auto sales being skewed towards larger SUVs and light heavy trucks. So, again as Gary said, it seems like every January Neil we find ourselves in a situation where we\u2019re looking at the year and everybody is trying to figure out, oh gee, is this over and is demand going to be totally eroded, and as he said I think it\u2019s just a little early to tell, but fundamentally it looks like things should go well for us going forward.","Neil Mehta","I appreciate that. The second question Joe, this to you is, just the outlook for M&A and I think in the past you\u2019ve said that you want to see that relative multiple between Valero and the Group move a little bit higher before you be more aggressive around M&A. So just your latest thoughts there and then also at the parent level and the also at the midstream level.","Joe Gorder","Okay, and Neil, we gave, we gave Ciskow the responsibility for this M&A activity, which he greatly appreciated, the added a responsibility. So if I give him a crack at this to start?","Mike Ciskowski","Yes, thanks Joe. I appreciate it. For Valero our appetite for midstream M&A and M&A in general hasn\u2019t changed. We continue to look at opportunities particularly those that support the earnings growth that we can achieve in our core business. The good news is we have a great portfolio and significant earnings capability as we demonstrated in 2015. More specific to the VLP, VLP hasn\u2019t reached the size where it can execute most of the M&A transactions on its own. But we do continue to evaluate opportunities there as well.","But as we said before we remain committed to VLP\u2019s dropdown growth strategy and we\u2019re not interested in a step up transaction that would change VLP\u2019s risk profile or its growth story.","Neil Mehta","I appreciate that Joe and Ciskow, thank you.","Operator","Thanks Neil. Our next question comes from ED Westlake from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ed Westlake","Good morning. Congrats. I think this time last year I\u2019d said I was going to drive down an F350 to Disney World and would that be enough gasoline yield from Valero and other refiners in the summer to make it possible for me to do so? So, I\u2019m going to ask the same question after a year of looking at gasoline markets and some very strong cracks and strong demands. What are you guys doing to be able to make more summer grade gasoline?","Gary Simmons","In the short run, I don\u2019t think we really have anything that we have on the horizon that\u2019s going to be able to increase our gasoline yield, but the big thing is the alky project that Lane mentioned that will give us additional ability in terms of making additional gasoline when that project comes online.","Joe Gorder","We are in maximum gasoline mode now though it\u2019s [indiscernible].","Gary Simmons","That\u2019s right, we are.","Ed Westlake","Okay. And then switching to the self help, obviously the toppers coming on stream, so we start to see them maybe in 4Q and into this year. You used to have sort of $500 million number, I think that\u2019s gone down to 430 million, just a reminder what you think key drivers will be in terms of the spreads driving that 430.","Lane Riggs","Hi, this is Lane. So the funny decision on both those units we had Brent and LLS, [indiscernible] pretty much in that environment if you want to - and we like to reference the historical price set. So if you look at those projects in 2015 the Corpus unit would give us about $200 million of EBITDA and the Houston crude unit would be about 230, so those are - and those are slightly [indiscernible] obviously are funding decision that in the current market we\u2019re pretty much at our funding decision. Maybe and as Joe allude to the Houston crude unit will start up in the second quarter and we fired up the crude unit in Corpus Christi without any incident and started fine.","Ed Westlake","Okay. And it\u2019s mainly crude against [VGO] [ph] spreads we should look at?","Lane Riggs","That\u2019s right, the driver here is crude versus really resid, so low sulphur resids.","Ed Westlake","Okay, helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we have a question from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Evan Calio","Good morning guys. Maybe a follow on to the product demand question, given the macro uncertainty pacing your cash returns to the net income makes sense on a quarterly basis. Ye how do you think about using the balance sheet to fund the cash returns buyback and has that changed at all given that macro uncertainty or share price volatility?","Mike Ciskowski","Well, our balance sheet is, Evan this is Mike, balance sheet is very, very strong and we intend to keep it that way. Our guidance is to pay out 75% of net income for 2016. So, as far as levering up [indiscernible] to meet that target, I'm not sure it will be required to do that. It's early in the year. So we'll just have to see how the year plays out.","Evan Calio ","Got it. And then, maybe a different follow-up on you shared the EBITDA on all these new projects, it will be contributing in 2016 and Corpus, Port Arthur, McKee and Houston in 1Q. I mean any color in aggregate how they affect your crude slate flexibility or just related, given, the right economic indicators, where do you need to max out your heavy sour and medium sour runs?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So the topper really just gave us more capability to run domestic light sweet barrels or foreign light sweet barrels. It really added to that. We haven't done anything that really materially changes our ability to process medium or heavy sour grades in our system. It was mainly of those two units are adding 160,000 barrels a day of light sweet capacity.","Evan Calio ","Right, and then but the up-tick quarter-to-quarter on overall heavy and medium sour runs, where could that be? And I'm sure that's an average number. So I'm just trying to get a sense of -- if you are kind of max flexed to this point or where you could take that? ","Lane Riggs","I\u2019d like to give you a little color on that, Evan. I will take the topper out so you can kind of have an apples-to-apples comparison. If you take the toppers out between last quarter and where we are today, we backed out about 400,000 barrels a day of lower 48 domestic light sweet crude and we've replaced that with medium sour grades and foreign light sweet imports. That's the big change in our system; heavy sours are about the same.","Evan Calio ","Got it. Appreciate it.","Operator","Paul Cheng from Barclays, your line is now open.","Paul Cheng","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hi, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Mike, actually this is for you. I'm going to ask from the other angle on the balance sheet. The last several years that you guys have done phenomenally well both operationally and financially and also the return to shareholder. I was just curious that as the cash flow remain strong at this point, does it make sense even though you already have a very, very strong balance sheet to maybe utilize a part of the free cash flow, maybe 20% or so, to further strengthen the balance sheet. I think that we all live through the up and down while I'm always on the market, I could be wrong. And that we have seen what happened, everyone was bullish in 2007 and then the bottom fell off because of the economy. So should we actually pick maybe a slightly different view at this point just as a safeguard to ensure that we build up some additional cushion even though your balance sheet is already remarkably strong but if the cash flow cut by half then maybe that will allow you to even have better opportunity to strike and pick the opportunity everyone is weak?","Mike Ciskowski","Okay. That's a quite a question Paul. And I remember those days very well. Our balance sheet is very strong and we intend to keep it that way. If you're suggesting that we build cash here, our current focus is to continue to look for opportunities to grow our business and increase our earnings per share. But if you are suggesting that we prepay some debt, the majority of our remaining debt contains make whole provision that made those prepayments less than compelling.","Paul Cheng","I see. So that you won't -- you won't able to prepay and you won't say add-on some additional cushion into your balance sheet by adding cash?","Mike Ciskowski","No. I don't think at this time that\u2019s what we will be doing. I think we can execute on our payout strategy and all that as I said earlier without levering up the balance sheet.","Paul Cheng","And that, Joe, just curious that with that, I think that some of the other company in distress and look like some retail asset maybe become cheaper. If you're looking at your portfolio, does it make sense that the entry point is right for you to reenter into retail by doing so that can -- maybe that cushion your gains, over the [indiscernible] gains, any win -- win cost increase or that to provide even a more direct outlet to your own refi product? Or that this is you\u2019re really not interested in going back into that business?","Joe Gorder","No, Paul, that's a good question. We look at it periodically. The retail business is materially different from the refining business, and you know that, I mean we\u2019re refining is capital intensive and [indiscernible] people and the retail business is people intensive. And we \u2013 when we look at it, I think our view would generally be that we don\u2019t need to control the retail outlet to be able to be a very good supplier into that market. And so frankly what we\u2019re focused on is, it\u2019s further extending our wholesale business, where we can have contractual relationships and support the Valero brand hit the street from the wholesale side rather than from a direct retail operation. If you reflect back on our retail volumes when we owned CST in the 1000 or so sites in Canada, the volume we moved through them was about a 125,000 barrels a day. And when you look at that as its order of magnitude relative to the total motor fuels that Valero is producing it\u2019s a very small percentage.","It would take a real huge step for us to have any kind of material presence to really allow us to hedge the benefits associated with owning retail directly. So, I don\u2019t know that unless there was really something that was just incredibly good are allowed us to sustain our contractual relationships with customers I don\u2019t see us reentering that market in the retail business.","Paul Cheng","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons and Company. Your line is open.","Jeff Dietert","Hey, it's Jeff Dietert with Simmons, good morning.","John Locke","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert","I appreciate the update on all the projects, I think the St. Charles hydrocracker, I didn\u2019t see an update on that, I apologize if I missed it. But could you talk about St. Charles?","Lane Riggs","Hi, this is Lane. So, we\u2019re currently changing the catalyst out and the capital - it\u2019s a small capital project, $40 million and it\u2019s just really a catalyst change out which is based on the cycle that we, when we change out the catalyst and the capital implementation or doing it right now. So it will be ready to go here in the second quarter.","Jeff Dietert","Okay. And could you talk about your EBITDA expectations on Port Arthur and St. Charles hydrocrackers what those are expected to contribute?","Lane Riggs","Well, we spent normally about $80 million on the two and our funding decision EBITDA somewhere between a total of $60 million to $80 million so these are an example of the sort quick hitting, self-help, these were also the low hanging fruit to sort of arbitrage out that there may be some [indiscernible], enough to figure out where we can put a little capital and get a pretty good hit on it, so I don\u2019t know if that will show up in the revenue stream or something like that to you guys, it will certainly show up in our margin capture going forward.","Jeff Dietert","And could you talk a little bit about Line 9 now that it\u2019s started up and what your flexibility is to take Canadian heavy versus Syn crude versus Bakken, what\u2019s the flexibility there in an environment where you are encouraged to take those grades.","Gary Simmons","Yes, this is Gary. So Line 9 we began taking crude in December, it\u2019s fully up and operational and at capacity; in terms of flexibility of grades, all of our crudes to Line 9 through Montreal and we really don\u2019t have logistics to be taking heavier or medium sours, it\u2019s pretty much just for light sweet crude for the Quebec refinery.","Jeff Dietert","Great. Thanks for your comments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Roger Read","Yes, thank you. Good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hi, Roger.","Roger Read","I guess maybe coming back to the gasoline question for this summer, octane ability as you look around what do you think the biggest roadblock will be again, is it going to the Octane alkylate side, is it going to be blending stocks and what is your assumption for gasoline demand growth this year, as you set up your expectations and budget?","Gary Simmons","Hey, Roger. This is Gary. I think we see that as long as we have a strong gasoline market and we have [indiscernible] sub-octane blend component like naphtha the gasoline pool is going to try to draw naphtha in and it\u2019s going to mean octane is fairly expensive. And so we expect to see alkylate values fairly strong again this summer. I don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that really leads me to believe that it\u2019s going to change anytime soon.","Roger Read","Then where, where will the industry look, I mean if you thought about it as a long hanging fruit thing, where would you be looking to pick up octane? I mean one of the thoughts is if US light sweet is declining and we are importing a light barrel, maybe we create a little bit more that way since the US barrel\u2019s tended to be on the low end for octane, but where else should we consider?","Gary Simmons","Well, I think for us we\u2019ve tried to look everywhere we can and this alky project was the best thing that we really felt was out there; we\u2019ve studied reforming, expanding reforming [indiscernible] new reformers and the alky project has the best return in our system.","Roger Read","But I mean more near-term, is there, are we just going to struggle 16 and 17, I mean I understand where we are in 19 but\u2026?","Gary Simmons","Yes, I think we will. I don\u2019t see anything in the near term that that\u2019s going to have a significant impact on the octane balance.","Roger Read","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company","Sam Margolin","Hey, good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hi, Sam.","Sam Margolin","I wanted to ask one more about the alky project here. There is a couple of others out there in the system, a lot of times these units as newly built units are paired with like a midstream acquisition or some other project to produce the feed by the operator. But is it fair to say that there is no real necessity to commit capital to source incremental NGLs here there is plenty available and so this alky unit can be built as a standalone or actually is it, does it, is it paired with maybe something coming off the toppers or another attribute of your yield right now?","Lane Riggs","Hi, Sam. This is Lane. Ours is a little bit different I\u2019d say than other people in the industry and what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re taking existing alkylation unit at Houston and we\u2019re converting it to alkylate C5 olefins; normally alkylation units alkylate C4 olefins and sometime C3 olefins. So we\u2019re taking the existing blend and retrofit it such that alkylate C5 olefins and we are building a new C4 olefins. What we are really doing if you draw, drew a boundary around the Houston refinery is we are shifting C5 olefins that are going out [indiscernible] gasoline, bringing in IC4 from Mont Belvieu which is readily available and inexpensive that\u2019s really what\u2019s happening in making an alkylate and also blending some additional butane for the low RVP, that\u2019s really what this project is. So it is different than I would say other people that are looking at this, and we are clearly ahead of everybody else in the industry with this projects.","Sam Margolin","Okay. Yes, that makes sense. I think it\u2019s been evaluated for quite a while, so it\u2019s clear that there is a lot of, I guess, gone into the process. This next one is sort of a moon shot, as you know, it\u2019s been reported Aramco is maybe looking to monetize some assets, you might also know that Shell has a fairly aggressive divestment target too. I don\u2019t know, is it fair to say that Motiva today is at least as attractive or as sensible of a consolidation candidate as maybe CITGO was two years ago in terms of sort of what\u2019s out there to bring into the fold, to the extent that I think Mike kind of alluded to the appetite hasn\u2019t changed but I don\u2019t know maybe availability of assets has?","Joe Gorder","Well, Sam that is a moon shot. I mean Motiva has a good business and they\u2019ve got good assets and if they we\u2019re for sale I\u2019d suspect that we\u2019d take a really good hard look at it, but we are not hearing anything, I hadn\u2019t heard anything that they are in the market.","Sam Margolin","All right, appreciate it. Have a good one.","Joe Gorder","You bet. Take care.","Operator","Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Phil Gresh","Hey, good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hi Phil.","Phil Gresh","First question just on VLP, how are you thinking about the drop down potential of VLP this year? Last year I think you had committed to a billion in drops, but you didn\u2019t give any specific commentary on the release. So I\u2019m just curios how you are thinking about the MLP market more broadly, evaluation, impacts etcetera?","Mike Ciskowski","Okay. Yes I feel right now a billion is our current plan toward the dropdown. But, the capital markets are pretty challenging right now. So we\u2019ll just have to continue to monitor this as we move through the year.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Second question is just there has been some talk about the uplift we could see from greater utilization rates from these Chinese refineries and the impact that could have on product export by China. I\u2019m just wondering how your speaking about this risk and do you think China\u2019s product quality can complete on the global market especially on the gasoline side?","Gary Simmons","I can, Phil. This is Gary, I don\u2019t know that I can really comment on the quality of their products, overall to me that capacity is capacity that\u2019s going to be very challenged globally because of the weak fuel market. It\u2019s going to be very difficult to run load complexity, capacity with the very low fuel environment.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Ryan Todd","Hey, thanks, good morning gentlemen, maybe said I wanted to say, maybe a quick follow up on the prior question on potential drop to VLP, I mean any thoughts as to what the next might look like between cash proceeds and equity, the Valero or any thoughts on evolution of multiples of those drops or too much uncertainty in the market at this point.","Joe Gorder","While there is a quite a bit of uncertainty in the market. So, at this point in time I really can\u2019t comment on how the cash proceeds would be and how the financing of those drops would be structured.","Ryan Todd","Okay. And then, maybe one follow up, I appreciate the comment you made earlier in terms of, some of your thoughts on medium sour and heavy sour differential in the sustainability going forward. Maybe can you give me any thoughts in terms of how you see light sweet desk whether its Brent WTI or LLS WTI evolved over the next three to six months, so we are going to need to see a widening of those spreads in order to clear Cushing and to incentivize imports and in particular I was kind of curious given the fact that you backed off 400,000 barrels a day of lower 40 light crude to your system, just generally how you\u2019ve seen, what your outlook is for the light sweet differential going forward over the next, over the course of this year?","Gary Simmons","This is Gary. I think over time LLS and Brent traded pretty close to parity, but I think we are going to have a lot of volatility between the grades as the year goes on. So, you know you can see LLS got, has to pay a premium for LLS and Brent, so we started importing foreign light sweets, we have the inventory gains here in the US, which I think tells you LLS was too expensive, so that LLS we discounted. I think we\u2019ll go through that volatility for the next six months, where we swing in and out of domestic light sweet production into our refining system.","Ryan Todd","Thanks. I appreciate that.","Operator","Doug Leggate from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate","Hi. Thanks. Good morning everybody. Thanks Joe. So Joe, I wanted to go back to your comments on gasoline, I think you said you were in max gasoline mode right now, what I am trying to understand is what happens to gasoline yields as the US swings back to imports on light sweet crude declines, I know everyone is focused on octane but, I\u2019m just wondering if you start to see a tightening of the balance [indiscernible] gasoline at this point I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s because --, I\u2019m just trying to understand the interplay as you see, things going in for the summer. So, I guess I\u2019m really looking to your prognosis on how those things bounce at?","Joe Gorder","Gary do you want to go ahead?","Gary Simmons","Yes. Overall, if you look at foreign light sweet barrel versus an Eagle Ford or Bakken type barrel and nasty yield from West African Saharan barrel is about the same as Bakken or Eagle Ford. So in terms of refining yield it\u2019s not significantly different whether we are running at West African barrel or we\u2019re running at domestic light sweet barrel.","Doug Leggate","Well as you swing back towards medium-heavy, does the yield makes change to them?","Gary Simmons","Yes, for medium to heavy barrel, it would accept for most of the refineries were running those barrels are very high complex refining assets. And again we don\u2019t see much of a yield difference with the complexity of our refineries when we\u2019re running a heavier diet. The only thing that we can get into is as we go heavy in some of our plants it can lower our utilization. So we get a lever effect by running light sweet at some of our refineries. So we have a big incentive to run much heavier crude diet it can mean that we are running slightly lower crude rate at some of those plants.","Doug Leggate","It tells me about the old school I guess. Thanks for that. My follow-up, it\u2019s probably more a Ciskowski question. Mike, , the tax rate looks like it\u2019s been consistently low now or becoming kind of a regular thing, so should we be looking at tax rate guidance moving lower as kind of permanent shift?","Joe Gorder","Well, we had a couple of unique items this past \u2013 this past quarter, because of the tax law finally was, they got final approval in the UK and then we had, we have some audits that are underway in the US and we happened to get those settled this quarter, and so that was reflective which pushed the rate down to 28%. So, we tried to do, the best that we can and given that guidance to you. But, 31%, 32% is what I would say for the first quarter.","Doug Leggate","Is that a good run rate going forward?","Joe Gorder","Yes, right now that would.","Doug Leggate","Okay, helpful. Thanks everybody.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Your line is open.","Chi Chow","Great, thank you.","Joe Gorder","Hey Chi.","Chi Chow","Hey, how are you doing Joe. Back on the products markets, can you comment on how you\u2019re assessing the supply demand balance of the global distillate market heading into this year? We saw material weakening of the diesel cracks as the year progress last year and just wondering on your thoughts on cause of this?","Gary Simmons","Yes, Chi, this is Gary Simmons. Overall, I think if you look at what drive distillate demand, its weather and then its economic activity and thus far, both in the US and in North West Europe we\u2019ve had warmer winters than what we\u2019ve historically had and so it led to lower distillate demand. So in terms of how do we correct from here, I think a lot of that correction gets back to some of this low complexity refining capacity with discounted fuel oil pricing, I think you know we\u2019ll see some economic run cuts and some of that low complexity, capacity that will bring the distillate market back into balance .","Chi Chow","What about the economic activity side of things, I mean you are seeing, you mentioned your exports are still pretty good, but are you concerned about global slowdown on the economic front?","Joe Gorder","I don\u2019t know that I can really comment on the global economic activity, but I can say we continue to see very robust demand for our products throughout the globe.","Chi Chow","What your exports of gasoline and diesel in the quarter?","Joe Gorder","Yes. In gasoline we did 157,000 barrels a day of gasoline, we did 264,000 barrels a day of diesel, if you add kerosene in with that it would be 307,000 barrels a day of total distillate.","Chi Chow","Okay, thank you. One other question, this is just kind of specific to your Gulf Coast system, we just noticed that your realized margin capture rate versus your index is always better in the fourth quarter in the Gulf Coast than the other three quarters of the year and that been pretty consistent last four years running. Why is that the case, is there any specific reason for that?","Joe Gorder","Well, I would say, certainly the butane blending would come into play there and so as butane has been discounted and we\u2019re able to blend it into the pool, it helps our capture rates, I don\u2019t know if you have anything else.","Lane Riggs","Hi, Chi. [This is Lane]. I want to add, normally seasonally what you see is medium to heavy sour discount widen out. So when you\u2019re using for the standard capture rate versus light sweet we always outperform on that as well.","Chi Chow","Okay. Hey, thanks Lane, I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Faisel Khan","Good morning guys.","Joe Gorder","Good morning.","Faisel Khan","Just quick question on the timing of the projects that came online in the fourth quarter, the Corpus Christi crude unit, the hydrocracker and the expansion of the key and it is also Line 9B sort of highlighted that was December startup, how did those start up in the quarter I\u2019m just trying to understand so what the contribution was from the commissioning of these assets in the quarter, just sort of we get sort of the uplift right going into 2016?","Lane Riggs","Hey, it\u2019s Lane. The key we finished that project which really took us about two years fully implement the entire scope that which was two things one was energy efficiency project and distillate recovering the second was sort plus crude rate. We finished it in October. I assume that what you\u2019re after. You\u2019re sort of after the timing --. And further again hydrocracker was down in October and they replaced the catalyst and did the expansion and then Corpus Christi really started up during sort of early to mid December so wouldn\u2019t see anything with respect to it, fourth quarter improvement that\u2019s really going to be entirely 2016 thing.","Faisel Khan","Okay, got it. And the key we would have seen full contribution in the quarter, but sounds like Port Arthur was down in October and then of course nothing from the Corpus?","Lane Riggs","That\u2019s right. Nothing from Corpus and obviously St. Charles are doing right now.","Faisel Khan","Okay. And then, right now given were crude prices are in Canada versus the Atlantic Basin is it make sense to max out Line 9B or where are we with the market in terms of how we benefit from that?","Lane Riggs","Yes. So, I would tell you on Line 9B we are seeing some value in the Bakken that we are running most of the Western Canadian light sweets we are not seeing material difference in being uplift in running those barrels compared to foreign light sweets that we get acquired into Quebec.","Faisel Khan","Got it. Okay. Great, thanks for the time guys, I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vikas Dwivedi from Macquarie Group. Your line is open.","Vikas Dwivedi","Hey, guys, quick question on gasoline and ethanol now, they\u2019ve been inverted for a while. Does that change how you guys blend or any of the approach to the overall gasoline operation given, sort of upside down from formal?","Martin Parrish","It's Martin Parrish, it\u2019s really the impact on the blending margin not only refineries margins, ethanol is selling at about its blend value everything kind of the blend value that\u2019s high octane. You have to remember that the blender still gets the RINs if they choose to blend ethanol. So, I know it works out, I don\u2019t, I would say there\u2019s really no impact \u2013 get it blended.","Vikas Dwivedi","Got it. And coming back to the LP plant is the C5 technology is that also a call on, kind of an oversupplied ethane or ethylene market down the road?","Joe Gorder","I don\u2019t know want to, it\u2019s not my call, it just really, you look at whole NGL market it\u2019s been pretty, if this is been long, and it really a view that we can take and move NGL into the gasoline pool and we can do it by [alkylating amylene] in the refinery which is a little bit different and it makes a good high octane low RVP component which then in turn allows us to blend additional butane in the summer in particular.","Vikas Dwivedi","Got it. And we were just thinking if it was a call that would be a great call. I think when we are drowning in the lighter end of the NGL barrel for a long time that?","Joe Gorder","I wouldn\u2019t call it ethane, it\u2019s a whole NGL space right which we believe is virtually long going forward to.","Vikas Dwivedi","Yes. All right. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We have a question from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Brad Heffern","Good morning everyone.","Joe Gorder","Good morning.","Brad Heffern","Circling back to the VLP, I\u2019m just curious we all know the uncertainty the turmoil in the capital markets, but it seems like the strategy is basically unchanged and you have 55% of the growth in 2016 in terms of budget going into VLP. At point do you think about that and maybe re-examine the pace of growth given that the market doesn\u2019t necessarily seem to be rewarding growth as much as it once was?","Joe Gorder","Yes. We will continue to \u2013 right now our plan is to do the billion dollars, but we\u2019ll continue to examine and monitor the markets as we move through the year. It is very challenging right now, we do have our revolver that we could use that as a financing source for some of the drops. So, the bank market seems to be a little bit more attractive than the capital market at this point in time.","Mike Ciskowski","Brad, let me just add to what Mike said. The capital that we\u2019re investing in logistics assets at Valero Energy are assets that can be dropped to VLP, so we\u2019ll continue to build the droppable EBITDA base. But the motivation behind it and we\u2019ve shared this before, the motivation behind Valero investing in logistics assets are projects that better fit Valero\u2019s core business, its core refining business that project that helps us optimize our operations. And we are not taken flyers on projects that we wouldn\u2019t be willing to commit what contractually long-term to. And so, again the things we are investing in today for example the diamond pipeline, I mean that is going to be a direct benefit to the Memphis refinery and provide crude optionality there that they don\u2019t currently have today. So, this is a long game and even though markets are challenged right now, I don\u2019t think we should sit here and throw the baby out with the bath water and totally redirect strategies to try to accommodate it. The other thing that Mike hasn\u2019t mentioned is that, VLP is in a great position like at very high coverage ratios to maintain distribution growth, that the targets we\u2019ve talked about is not going to be an issue. And here again we are running the business to continue to improve the business and drive the EPS growth at VLO and VLP is going to go along for the ride. Anyway, that\u2019s just a little more color.","Brad Heffern","Thanks for that Joe, I think that's clear. And then thinking about logistic opportunities as well, I\u2019m curious obviously lifting in the crude expo we are seeing negative for refiners in general, but I think there might be some opportunities that present themselves to Valero given the amount of dark space in general footprint in the Gulf Coast set. Have you thought along those line Joe?","Rich Lashway","Hi. This is Rich Lashway. Yes, we thought about that, that opportunity. We are in conversations with lot of different parties on projects that they have that they willing to share now that they might not have been in the past. And so we could see quite a bit of opportunity out there given not just the declining crude price, but also the export opportunity.","Brad Heffern","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our last question is a follow up question from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your line is open.","Paul Cheng","Hey, guys, real quick, may be this for Gary. Gary just curious that crude inventory over the last several weeks quite substantial, do you have any rough idea there was a split between the financial buyer, buying it to take advantage on the contango curve, or what percentage is the operator actually the refiner who are building inventory here ?","Gary Simmons","I don\u2019t suspect this a lot of refiners building inventory, most of our tankage and most refiners tankage is more operational in nature. So it\u2019s hard to really utilize that tankage for a contango play. Most of that you see some inventory builds in Cushing, but I don\u2019t know that I really could comment in terms of the build. I think you know what we had happened is LLS got at a premium to a foreign light sweet alternative and Valero along with many other refineries started buying light sweet and it caused the inventory to build and certainly the markets structures incentivized people to store as well.","Paul Cheng","Okay, thank you.","John Locke","Okay, Elanda I think that\u2019s last for the question. So we want to thank you everyone for calling in today and please feel free to call me and Karen if you guys have further follow up questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Our team again delivered solid operating results and distinctive financial performance during a quarter where we saw heavy maintenance activity and soft margins. Our continued focus on safety and reliability in our plants has been key to our ability to capture the available margin.","In the first quarter, we saw healthy domestic and export demand for refined products driven by low prices, seasonal weather conditions in North America and Europe, and a resurgence of domestic oil patch activity. Latin America also continued to be a strong source of demand for gasoline and diesel.","On the crude supply side, we continued to see rig count increases in the U.S., particularly in the Permian Basin. As production ramps up and more domestic sweet crude makes its way to the Gulf Coast our refineries in the Mid-Continent and the Gulf Coast are prepared to capture the feedstock opportunities. While RIN prices have declined relative to 2016 there's still a significant headwind for the quarter. At this level, RIN's expense remains an issue for us, so we continue to work with regulators.","Turning to our refining segment, in the first quarter we completed a heavy turnaround schedule at our Benicia, Texas City, St. Charles, and Meraux refineries. Our employees and contractors safely executed these projects. With the majority of our planned maintenance for the year behind us, we should be ready to capture available market opportunities.","In our ethanol business, we had record production volumes for the quarter as higher ethanol prices and strong demand for ethanol exports supported production rates. Also in the first quarter, we invested $641 million of sustaining and growth capital, construction is progressing on the Diamond Pipeline with completion expected at the end of this year. Work on the Diamond Green Diesel plant expansion, the Houston alkylation unit and the Wilmington cogeneration plant is continuing as planned.","Turning to our MLP, as we disclosed in our 10-K for 2016, we created a new VLP segment to align how we manage and allocate resources. Growth in our VLP segment is critical to Valero's strategy to optimize the supply chain.","The third party acquisition of the Red River pipeline in January is a good example of VLP executing this strategy, which is focused on assets that are key to Valero's operations or that will supply third party volumes without taking on commodity risk.","Lastly, regarding cash returns to stockholders, we paid $629 million in cash through dividends and stock buybacks. So, we believe we're in good shape to exceed our payout target for the year. This payout demonstrates the company's free cash flow generating capability even in a soft margin environment.","So, with that, John, I'll hand it back over to you.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Thank you, Joe. For the first quarter, net income attributable to Valero's stockholders was $305 million, or $0.68 per share, compared to $495 million or $1.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016. First quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $283 million, or $0.60 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to page three of the financial tables that accompany our release.","Operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2017 was $647 million, compared to $915 million for the first quarter of 2016, which has been revised retrospectively to reflect the new VLP segment. First quarter 2017 operating income was in line with first quarter of 2016 adjusted operating income of $652 million.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day, which was in line with the first quarter of 2016. Our refineries operated at 91% throughput capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2017, which reflects turnarounds that occurred at the Benicia, Texas City, St. Charles, and Meraux refineries.","Refining cash operating expense of $3.85 per barrel were $0.39 per barrel higher than the first quarter of 2016, mainly due to a higher level of maintenance activity and higher energy costs in the first quarter of 2017.","The ethanol segment generated $22 million of operating income in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $39 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter of 2016 was $9 million. The increase from the 2016 adjusted amount was primarily due to the higher ethanol prices and record production volumes. Operating income for the VLP segment in the first quarter of 2017 was $70 million compared to $43 million in the first quarter of 2016. The primary drivers for the increase in operating income are contributions from the McKee, Meraux, and Three Rivers Terminal and the Red River Pipeline which were acquired subsequent to the first quarter of last year. The Red River Pipeline operations, acquired in January, have been integrated into VLP and are performing as expected.","For the first quarter of 2017, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate depreciation, were $190 million and net interest expense was $121 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $500 million and the effective tax rate was 26% in the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate was lower than expected, mainly due to a reduction in the statutory rate in Quebec and favorable settlements from several state income tax audits.","With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $8.5 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.5 billion, of which $66 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 24.1%. We have $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $720 million was available for only VLP.","We generated $988 million of cash from operating activities in the first quarter, excluding a working capital benefit of $151 million, net cash generated was $837 million. With regard to investing activities, we made $641 million of growth and sustaining capital investments, of which $245 million was for turnarounds and catalyst.","Moving to financing activities, we returned $629 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $315 million in dividend payments and $314 million for the purchase of 4.7 million shares of Valero common stock. As of March 31st, we had approximately $2.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining.","Our guidance for 2017 capital expenditures of $2.7 billion remains unchanged. This amount which includes turnarounds, catalyst, and joint venture investments consists of approximately $1.6 billion for sustaining and $1.1 billion for growth.","For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.69 million to 1.74 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 285,000 to 305,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 455,000 to 475,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter to be approximately $3.70 per barrel.","Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the second quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash cost, such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation for the second quarter, to be around $170 million, and net interest expense should be about $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $500 million, and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 30%.","That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their questions too. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And we have our first question from Benny Wong with Morgan Stanley.","Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. You had some positive market commentary in your press release this morning. I'm just curious to hear your thoughts around product balances for refining runs (12:13) expected to pick up strongly, and where you expect the demand to come to meet that?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. Benny, I think what we've seen is early \u2013 and I'll talk about gasoline first. Earlier in the year, we saw that gasoline demand looked to be down a little bit and when we looked at the data more specifically, you could see it was a lot weather related, especially on the West Coast, you had a rainy season which caused demand to be down. As we progressed through the quarter, our March volumes looked to be fairly consistent with what we saw last year. So I think we think domestic demand will be fairly consistent with what we saw last year, but we're seeing a stronger pull on exports than what we saw last year, particularly Latin America, there appears to be a good pull of gasoline into Mexico and South America.","On the distillate side, really for the whole first quarter we saw slightly better distillate demand, some of that was due to a little bit colder weather. We've seen good agricultural demand and then as we start to see the upstream recover, we're starting to see a pull there as well, on the distillates. And then distillates exports are also strong, again same \u2013 we're seeing some exports to Europe, but mainly strong export demand into Latin America.","Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Really appreciate that color. And just in regards to splitting of the VLP results, can we read into this as a signal to expect a lot more growth in dropdown activity in this area?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","You know, we don't provide guidance on our dropdowns as it relates to the VLP. We're in good shape. We do provide the distribution growth plans for the next two years, but we have high coverage rate at the LP, and so we're not going to provide any of the dropdown guidance.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","And Benny, I think, and John can talk a little bit too, he and Mike, we went through this process of trying to decide, did we want to go ahead and create the segment. We felt we needed to create the segment so that there was more line of sight to what it is, and then the question becomes, what do you put in the segment? We decided to keep it as clean as possible and just be sure that everybody had a line of sight to the fact that this is the way we manage the business, and we wanted it to be very clear and clean. So the portfolio of assets that we have at Valero that are still droppable, all of that EBITDA that's droppable into VLP is there, but we didn't want to cloud it by including that. So anyway, it's a pretty straight up segment.","Benny Wong - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for the color. Appreciate it guys.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, Phil.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question, just wanted to come back to Joe, your commentary on RINs. Do you view that the quarterly run rate here as a fair number for the full year? I think you're expecting a higher number when we were coming out of last quarter. And then just generally, your thoughts on what's happening right now, thoughts on the preliminary RVO standard point of obligation potential. I know there was a hearing going on yesterday where the U.S. Appeals Court was questioning the EPA's authorities, and suggesting Congress should be responsible for fixing the renewable fuel standards. So it seems like there's a lot of information out there.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. Phil, that's a good question, and I'll let Gary talk a little bit about the RIN market, and then Jason can just give you an update on the regulatory front, if that's okay.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","So, I think, we certainly saw, especially D6 RINs call off early in the year. We're not really ready to revise our guidance at this time. We're going to keep our guidance where it is, and we'll just see how successful we are on some of these things about moving the point of obligation and what happens to RINs.","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","And regarding the 2018 \u2013 regarding the timeline for releasing the 2018 RVO targets, we think they're going to try to hit the November 30th deadline. They're going to try to stay on target. To meet that, they need to push the proposed rule out by late May or early June. And on those oral arguments you mentioned that occurred yesterday on the lawsuit relating to the 2014 to 2016 RFS targets, we understand there were a lot of questions, and the judges were pushing the EPA on the grounds that they'd used to grant the waiver in their questions.","I think they were kind of signaling that maybe the EPA could have used another ground which had been even more defensible than the one that they did. They based it on the inadequate domestic supply of biofuels versus causing severe economic harm. But we wouldn't read too much into the questions at oral argument. We do think the EPA properly issued the waiver when they did it and one thing that we would note is in the arguments and the questions from the judges, it was clear to us that our arguments at the point of obligation should be evaluated in setting the RVO numbers which was what we claimed in the case had some traction. The judges seem to buy into that, so we were encouraged by that.","Now, on what we think is going to happen with the point of obligation overall. Kind of to give you an update on the process we're going through, the comment deadline on our petition to change the point of obligation was February 22nd. The EPA has now received all of the comments and they're receiving them. We think the majority of the comments that were filed are in favor of our position and with the new team at the EPA we're really hopeful. We think when they look at the facts we expect them to resolve this question in our favor. And on timing which is what a lot of people are asking, there's no specific deadline on the EPA. We think they're diligently looking at this and there's a lot of concern and urgency because of the harm the high RIN prices are doing to the refining sector, so we think it could be done in the next six months if they push it.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great, that's very helpful. I appreciate the color. Second question would just be on light-medium, and light-heavy differentials. We started to see some timing here in the second quarter which I presume is mostly due to the effects of the OPEC cuts starting to flow through. Is that consistent what you guys have been seeing out there? And generally how are you thinking about light-medium, light-heavy differentials?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. I think that is consistent. We saw that when OPEC announced their cuts that there wasn't a big market reaction and I think a lot of that was we feel like there was a demand offset to the supply offset, so we had lower refinery demand with turnaround season and then they weren't burning as much oil, so there wasn't that much of an impact. And then we also think that a disproportionate amount of cuts went to the Far East and not to the U.S. market. As the U.S. has come out of turnaround season you're seeing a bigger impact of those cuts on the medium to light differential and I think where we are is we just kind of are waiting to see if really the OPEC countries are committed to our market or not. So far they've kind of sent the volume they want to send, but we got in last week where the differentials were to the point where economic signals were starting to point us to switch to a more domestic light sweet diet and back out the medium sour from the Middle East. What we've seen this week it's starting to widen back out, so I think they recognized that and I think they're committed to maintaining market share here and we've kind of seen a floor on that medium to light spread because you started to see refinery switch to the lighter diet and so this week it's improved about $0.50 from where we were last week.","Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I think this maybe for Gary, the first question. Gary, I believe you guys had mentioned you're spending about $350 million a month in the secondary costs outside of feedstock which means that (20:27) to bring either the feedstock or the crude or the product from pond to pond (20:31) and that is a major area where that you think optimization and improvement could be. Could you give us an example what could be done and how big is the magnitude. Are we talking a about potential 10% is the reasonable medium term objective of benefit or higher or lower and any kind of a number that you can share?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Paul, so it's really impossible for us to give guidance in theory because so much of what's rolled into this is outside of our control, so just to give you an example, freight rates play a big role in that overall $350 million of spend. Things that we're doing is renegotiating terminal deals that we have, making sure that our barge utilization is efficient as it can and so what we'll try to do is work with John. We have some dashboarding tools that we're using to measure our progress and we'll try to work with him to see if there's something we can share with you guys going forward, but I can't really give you a dollar target.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. A second one, Joe, in terms of the organic investment opportunity in the company, where do you see the biggest opportunity for the next, say, two or three years?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Paul, I think it's in the refining side of the business, in the midstream side of the business. I'll let Lane talk a little bit about the projects that we've got going on in refining and then maybe Rich wants to share a little bit about anything we got going on on the logistics side, but Rich don't tell them anything secret.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","We will keep it a secret here.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","I know you would, Paul. All right.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Paul, this is Lane. We still have a strategic outlook of what we think, we are always looking at our assets with respect to feedstock flexibility. And really there's two lines that we invest there. One is to look at the natural capital arbitrage as it sits in refining to make sure we can fill it out the way we'd like and make sure we have access to the right feedstock. The other way we invest in that is, here's Rich's area and that's getting connectivity to terminals or get docks with respect to getting the products out or the feedstocks in, so really when we think about feedstock flexibility, it's really the opportunity to invest both in refining and logistics.","We also have sort of a long-term outlook that we think octane is going to be valuable and we're in the process of building our Houston alky, we're looking at other octane capability throughout our system and so that's really the other one. And the final one is we're building the cogens at both Wilmington and we're looking at one at Pembroke and this is in response to what we think that natural gas price where there's an arbitrage between how the utilities are going to provide power costs versus our ability to make it ourselves using natural gas.","Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.","Paul, this is Rich. Part of the organic stuff that we've got going on is we've been vocal about the Diamond Pipeline. That's gone through the DRB process and has full funding approval. We're about 40% complete on that. Going forward, the organic stuff that we look at kind of is supportive of Gary's $350 million of secondary costs which are pipelines and terminal expenses and we look at opportunities to organically grow into some of these markets and get around third-party costs. So Gary's secondary costs provide us an opportunity to look at organic projects. And again, we can't talk about those because they're still going through the gating process, but for this year the billion dollars of strategic capital, about 50% of that is for logistics projects to address some of Gary's secondary costs and we expect that that kind of thinking or that kind of strategic capital going forward would continue.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Paul, just more broadly on this. We've talked about the fact that we're interested from a strategic perspective in integrating more assets that go into the refinery and moving product out of the refinery. And that's not a short-term strategy that's a long-term strategy. Along with the other things that we're doing. Safety, reliability and environmental focus and then shareholder returns is the third component. So I think, the strategy that we've got in place today, certainly we have line of sight to the next couple of years, but it's a strategy that I believe works long-term. It allows us to continue to increase the value of the business. So we're very comfortable with it. And again, Rich and Lane are both developing projects, we scrub them hard and then we'll just see which ones we want to proceed with going forward. But the focus is clearly around the core business of refining and marketing and around ethanol.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys, good morning. This is (25:45) on for Doug.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","Earlier you mentioned \u2013 good morning. Earlier you mentioned still strong export into Latin America and I'm guessing that's probably due to still load utilization in the region. I'm just wondering if that's a sustainable trend or if you see that improving at any point this year?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. So I think some of it is certainly related to refinery utilization in the region. And as mechanical availability has fallen off, it's opened the door for us to supply the market. But going forward in addition to that, we also see that there's some good demand growth trends that we're starting to see, particularly in Brazil, which had had negative demand growth. It looks like it's turned positive. So I think even as refinery utilization improves, you'll see demand growth in the region, which should allow us to continue to see that as a good export market.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Second question just on the cash returns to shareholders. They came in above guidance in this quarter, when guidance is, obviously, 75% of net income. Just wondering what the fee considerations were in this quarter in regards to the buyback level. Was it cash flow, balance sheet cash, operating outlook? Any color would be appreciated and I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, yeah. You're exactly right. When we look at what our payout is going to be for the quarter, we do look at our expected discretionary cash flow that's going to be generated that particular quarter. We also look at our excess cash balance that we may have in determining what we want to pay out for that particular quarter. So for this quarter we paid out a little over 200% of net income, but when you look at our cash flow, excluding the working capital benefit, it's about 75% of our cash flow. And that's how we'll look at it going forward.","Unknown Speaker","Got you. Thanks so much for the color, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Yeah, just wanted to return to two conversations. One is the $1.1 billion of growth capital. I appreciate you don't want to talk about specifics, but do you think the top of the funnel of the opportunity set for that $1.1 billion is getting larger as the U.S. producers get back to work? Trying to think about how many years you have of projects identified to drive that self-help component of total shareholder return?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","So, Ed, this is Lane. So, when you think about our capital budget, our talking numbers is we normally spend about $2.5 billion on CapEx a year. $1.5 billion of which is turnarounds and sustaining capital. It's really about $1 billion. So you can think about, I would say, a long-term run rate of $1 billion. And that's kind what we think that we naturally with our assets can manage well. And do sort of with our strategic outlook. We absolutely believe and already \u2013 I would say most particularly Rich's stuff is largely in the area of expanding logistics connectivity or refining operation and trying to run the sort of oil shale play. To the extent it would get bigger, we would certainly have a conversation and talk about whether we see a larger opportunity in that. But really our message is about $1 billion a year we're going to try to manage the business around.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then I don't want to waste too many on policy, but I guess I should ask if we're going to have corporate tax plan coming out tomorrow. Not so much on corporate taxation, but on BAT, whether you've heard whether the oil industry would be exempt or what the latest is. What you're hearing on the BAT, border adjustment tax.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, hang on a second, Ed.","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","Sorry. Ed, this is Jason again. Yeah, we think the likelihood of the BAT being included in tax reforms declined substantially. It's definitely one of the more controversial aspects of tax reform. And with the difficulties the Republicans had with healthcare, we don't see them wanting to take on another fight or create another fight within the party, and the BAT clearly splits the business community. You have people for it and against it. So, for that reason, we think that's probably one of the first things they'll move away from as they try to move forward and get a win on tax reform.","Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning, Brad.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Joe. Gary, I was wondering if we could follow up a little bit on the earlier OPEC conversation. I was wondering specifically about some of the Latin American heavy grades, if you've seen any sort of decline in availability? I know in the first quarter there were concerns about Maya availability. Has that continued, and maybe have you seen Venezuela volumes declining?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, so what we've seen, I guess, overall is, it does look like Venezuela's production has fallen off some. But their internal consumption for their refineries has kind of fallen off almost at a commensurate amount, so exports from Venezuela have been fairly constant actually. And then, we're seeing actually a growth in Brazilian production. So we're seeing more Brazilian barrels on the market. And then on the Maya question, we've continued to receive our contract volumes from Mexico fairly consistently.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Got it. And then maybe sticking with you, Gary, or maybe Lashway, on the Diamond Pipeline, obviously, we know the cost of the project. But I was wondering if you could give any color as to how it's expected to affect the laid-in crude cost at Memphis or any sort of EBITDA contribution for VLO that you can provide?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, so the way we view it, I mean, without giving too much specifics, today we're at a U.S. Gulf Coast plus Capline tariff to get a laid-in cost for Memphis' crude. And we believe that, with the Diamond Pipeline, we'll be at a U.S. Gulf Coast minus. And so it will be a significant change for the Memphis refinery. It's kind of hard to give EBITDA estimates, because you're kind of doing a market read in order to be able get that. But we believe it will have a significant impact on Memphis.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, understood. Thanks.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sorry, good morning. Had the mute on there.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. I guess, maybe going back to some of the questions earlier on the light heavy diff and where the narrowness of the differential incentivized going back to a light barrel. Thinking a little more forward, and using maybe a consensus expectation for light production in the U.S., Gary, where do you see your ability to run light barrels, if the differentials are favorable? Is that a 100,000, a 300,000, or potentially much higher than that, if the differentials are favorable kind of number?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, so we believe our capacity to process the light sweet crude is about 1.4 million barrels a day. So, if you look at our Investor Relations presentation, there's a pretty good slide there showing our ability to swing between grades. But overall, our total processing capacity is about 1.4 million barrels a day of light sweet capacity in the system.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And over the past year, you've run closer to which level?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, I'm not sure on the volume. Do you know, Lane?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I think we've been more like 1.1 million or 1 million barrels per day. If you look at our history \u2013 historically, where we were, that was probably about the case. Since the last time we had really compelling economics to run light crude, we finished both of these topper projects at Houston and Corpus. So we are in a position to run more even than we did last time, so.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And would we need to see substantially wider light differentials? And I'm kind of thinking LLS against Brent right now. Is that the right marker, or should we think more of a \u2013 it's an Eagle Ford or a Midland barrel at the Gulf Coast?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, so, you know the rule of thumb we always use is that the medium sours need to be discounted by 5% to your light sweet alternative. So, that's not 5% discounted to Brent. That would be a 5% discounted to whatever you're paying for Eagle Ford, and that's why last week, with where the medium sours were priced in the Gulf, our light sweet alternative favored going ahead and running light sweet.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great, thanks. And then my last question, just an accounting question. With the breakout of VLP, we saw a change in year-over-year refining margins. I think it's fairly straightforward, but we also saw a decline in reported OpEx of about $0.10. And I was wondering, is that tied to VLP, or is that something else that's going on?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","No, that is tied to VLP.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, great. Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Roger.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning, all.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Can I first ask just a relatively short-term question, which is just about your crude imports and how those are shifting, with seemingly not much impact from OPEC cuts. I just wondered if you could confirm that. Anything that you could add on Venezuela and Mexico would be interesting, would be part one.","And then, to help you \u2013 give you some time to think, Joe, there was a mention there of a long-term bullish view on octane. I was just wondering how else you're thinking long-term about strategy? There's kind of a peak oil demand argument that's very widespread right now. Could you address really what you think the long-term challenges and opportunities are for Valero, in terms of how the market's shifting? Thanks.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","I guess I'll start with the crude question. Really, the imports we're getting from Venezuela and from Mexico have been fairly flat. We're not seeing much of a change there. The big change really, on the medium sours we've shifted a little bit. We've seen more of an impact from both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on the medium sour barrels we import from there, and we backfill those with some additional South American grades and Canadian grades. And then recently, over the last few weeks, we have actually started at one of our refineries to maximize some light sweet and replace some of the medium sour we're importing there.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","So, Paul, on the strategy and I mentioned it earlier. I think the things that we're doing today and they're very much focused on making us the best refining and marketing operation out there, and I believe that, based on the independent surveys that we really are the best, but we continue to raise the bar for ourselves and try to drive it forward. Again, that's not a short-term activity. That is a long-term activity that we'll continue to do going forward. Now, if you think long-term about the markets, okay, and the demand for our products more specifically, you say, well is U.S. demand going to continue to grow going forward? I think our forecast would be that in the next five to ten years you might see a slight decline in gasoline demand in the U.S. Diesel will be determined by economic activity, and so we'll just see how that goes. But as Gary mentioned earlier, we are seeing decent diesel demand, and a lot of that is being driven by the increase in activity that we've got in the E&P side of the business.","If you think longer term and you think about where demand is going to grow, everything we read is that, globally, you're going to have increased demand for all of our products. And so our focus will go beyond the U.S. borders and we'll take a look at opportunities to increase our market presence in different international markets, and one of the things that Rich and his team are focused on are establishing a footprint in some of those markets so that we have better access to them on a rateable basis.","So, I don't think you should expect us to shift the strategy materially going forward. Clearly, midstream growth is something we're focused on. Continuing to improve our refining and our renewables operation is something we're focused on. And then we've talked in the past about the possibility to take some of the streams that we're producing today and high grade them by legging into the petrochemical business. That's something that's probably a little bit longer term, but it is something that we're actively looking at these days and trying to figure out what is a way for us to enter that type of business, boiling the frog rather than diving in head first and see if we can create another earnings stream for the company.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood, Joe. I mean, one of the obvious responses to potential threats is ongoing operational improvements that you've talked about. How much more do you think you can do in terms of the utilization which we've seen steadily rising for you guys? And the operational costs, how much further do you think you can drive those down? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Paul, I'll let Lane talk about that a little bit.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","As Joe alluded to, I mean, using common metrics, we're sort of in our own space with respect to availability, but we continue to try to get better because when we look at our entire portfolio, not all of our assets are first quartile mechanical availability, whereas many of them are. So we can always work on the ones that aren't. And we have great programs to get us in that area.","In terms of costs, the real cost focus is what was talked about earlier, that's in our effort to reduce secondary costs. And Gary talked about it. It's through commercial efforts to negotiate and use our size to negotiate better and then let Rich figure out places where we can build assets that will directly allow us to essentially charge ourselves the cost of that and ultimately move those into droppable assets into the MLP.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you very much, everyone.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Guys, good morning. Long time no see.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","How are you doing, Blake?","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Good. Question for you, I think probably for Mike on the tax rate. It just seems like the past few quarters have continuously come in below expectations. I know you gave a guidance for 1Q, but I'm just trying to get a sense of maybe, I guess, the Quebec piece of it probably feels more sustainable. So any thoughts around that continuing to trend lower than what we've seen historically?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I guess I would \u2013 how I would characterize that is we do have a few audits that are underway and that we don't know the exact timing on when those will be settled. So, here, this past quarter we did settle a couple of our state audits favorably which resulted in a reversal of some reserves, which then lowered the tax rate. So I think our 30% number is a good number. Unless we have some of these other events occur that allows us to lower the rate.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Okay. Fair enough. The second question is on the CapEx budget. I know you kind of tackled the growth piece of it, but mine is on the sustaining capital part. $1.6 billion. I know that includes some tier compliance and I guess I'm just wondering, as you kind of get through that this year, is there an opportunity for that to move lower into the future? Or should we just be thinking of always kind of some type of compliance that's going to land in there, so it's really the $1.6 billion is probably a good number go-forward?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Blake, this is Lane. I'll answer this in a couple of ways. One is I would say we believe and the guidance we've given is more of about $1.5 billion, of which I would say $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion is like truly sustaining capital. Somewhere around $200 million to $300 million is what we think normally is sort of regulatory spend that is not \u2013 we sort of put into the sustaining capital but it's not like we're \u2013 we're not rebuilding our assets or maintaining them, it's something that we're having to do due to regulatory things. We're a little bit higher this time due largely to Tier 3. Our Tier 3 spend is about $500 million, of which much of it will \u2013 we'll continue to spend up until the time that we have to be in compliance which is January 1st of 2020. And the bulk of it \u2013 really the bulk of that spend will be in 20018 and 2019.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Maybe you've touched on this a couple of times, maybe one follow up on midstream growth opportunities. Can you characterize a little bit the environment for, I guess, for growth opportunities and returns that you're seeing on that side of the business? I mean, I think we've seen \u2013 we continue to see midstream operators take skinnier economics in order to compete in some regions. And those are certainly in areas that have (43:55) kind of crude transport in some of the more popular growth basins, which I think you guys have generally avoided up to this point. But, as you think about your opportunities to deploy incremental capital, are you seeing downward pressure on returns in those types of businesses? Any thoughts on dynamics in that part of the business would be great.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Ryan, let me just try to be sure we're clear. So, there's two things we're looking at, right? One, are the organic growth projects that we're doing. I would say that we're not reducing our return thresholds on our organic growth projects in the midstream part of the business, and we kind of target, whether it be a drop or whether it be an organic growth project, we want to be like a 12% pre-tax IRR regardless, okay? Now if you're thinking in terms of M&A and the valuations that we're seeing on midstream assets, I'd say that they're pretty doggone aggressive, okay? Rich, you want to -","Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, no, the bid asking is very wide and it depends on how aggressive people want to be on this. I mean, we're always interested in looking at these opportunities, given that they be strategic for Valero. But today we would say, it's like Joe said, it's very aggressive right now out there.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I mean, you saw -- Ryan, you saw the recent deal that was done around Navigator. And I don't know what the rate of return might be on that, but it was a very aggressive bid, it seemed.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, I guess we should expect you guys to be more focused on organic opportunities than inorganic, is that safe to say, at least in the near term?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","No, I wouldn't say that. We're going to continue to do what we've done and Mike runs the M&A group here. I mean, we're going to look at everything that's out there and try to make a determination. In a perfect world, we'd find a bunch of assets where we can earn the types of returns who want to do the deal in VLP and it would provide some kind of strategic synergy for Valero Energy also. And we evaluate it looking at it both ways. We have probably liberalized our strategy around VLP a little bit. Historically, I've said that we look at the projects from Valero Energy's perspective first and then decide if we can or can't do it at VLP. And I would tell you that still is the primary motivation, but we are looking at transactions now that would be somewhat more third-party that the user of the asset would be a third-party, but it would bring value to Valero in some way. So, we're adjusting our perspective as we go.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great, thanks. That's very helpful. And then maybe one more on payout, and I realize that you've already touched on this a few times, and it seems to come out every quarter, but how do you think about your willingness to expand the balance sheet to returning cash to shareholders not just on a quarterly basis because I realize there's volatility around that, and fourth and first quarters tend to be particularly weak, but your willingness to expand the balance sheet, outspend cash flow to buy back stock on an annual basis over the course of the year? Is that something you're willing to do on a more sustainable basis and at what point is leverage a limiting factor?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, I don't think we would be \u2013 we wouldn't lever up a material amount to increase our share \u2013 or we wouldn't lever up at all to increase our share buybacks. What we do look at, like I said, as we look at our discretionary cash flow that we expect to earn for the next quarter and the next couple of quarters, we balance that with our capital requirements that we have, and the other things that we have in place that we have to cover, debt service, whatever it is. So we are forward looking in that. Our plan is not to hoard cash, however. And our plan is to remain competitive with our peers and payout, but we would not lever up our balance sheet to return cash to shareholders.","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Fernando Valle with Citi.","Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi guys, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Good morning.","Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","My question is back on the organic expansion, and if you would consider growing in wholesale in Mexico following the liberalization in the market? And there's been a strong pull of gasoline of late. Is that an area where you'd consider growing the wholesale business?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes.","Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Is it a place \u2013 given the succinct answer, is it a place where you're currently exploring opportunities for growth? Have you made any advancements already, or still very early?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, okay. I told Rich I didn't want him revealing secrets, right? But, no, obviously we're looking at it. I mean, we sell \u2013 Gary, you sell a lot of barrels into Mexico today, okay? And I think everybody out there is going to be looking at Mexico as a growth opportunity. And it's certainly one that is very logical for us to pursue. And so, I think you should assume that it's something that we plan to be involved in. And not only Mexico, but other Latin American countries also.","Fernando Valle - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Fair enough. Great, thanks, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Margolin with Cowen and Company.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. How's it's going?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Sam.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, my first question is about crude exports from the U.S. They've been rising really rapidly, and it's a little bit surprising that you would think, as exports grow, the exporter would have to give up price, but you don't really see it reflected in the markers that we have access to, at least, in the Gulf. And so maybe these exporters have other commercial things underneath the marker? But just generally, how do you see this playing out? Most people believe that exports need to keep rising. Is it eventually going to be reflected in the prices that are offered broadly to domestic refiners, or is it going to be something where the point of these exports is to keep those markers stable, and basically domestic refiners wouldn't get the same advantage?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Sam, this is Gary. I think you're going to continue to see volatility in the markets. And so we see that the domestic markers get a little strong and then weaken again, and you see imports come and then you see exports rise again. We've been very active exporting to our refiners in our system. We've been exporting to Quebec for quite a while now, and in the first quarter, we exported volume to Pembroke, and ran our first Permian Basin barrels in the Pembroke refinery, and saw good economic advantage to do that.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, this is sort of a follow up on Ryan's question about the capital structure. Valero is making a lot of investments to address third party costs and increase reliability and flexibility. The effect is kind of to bring the range of earnings through the cycle higher, on sort of a continuous basis. So, just to piggyback on kind of what Ryan was asking in a different way, does that allow the company to sort of support a little bit higher leverage? The industry exited a period of deleveraging recently, and I wonder if some of these investments that bring long-term advantages could lead to debt maturing, or reversing even?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Sam, I'll let Mike speak to the levels of leverage, okay? But I mean very clearly what we're trying to do is create higher lows and higher highs in our EPS. And we really like to distinguish ourselves as a company that is able to produce earnings in challenging margin environments. And I think we've demonstrated that over the last several quarters. So, the kind of the self-help focus is something that we're just going to maintain as part of what we do going forward. Whether it allows us to achieve higher levels of leverage. I mean, Mike?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Valero Energy Corp.","Well, I guess theoretically, you could say that would be the case. However, we have provided a debt to cap range of 20% to 30% that we're comfortable with. Maintaining our investment grade credit rating is very important to the company, and a debt level within that range, we think, we do that.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","You bet.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. Back on your feedstocks. Can you talk about, how does running more light crude in your system impact yields, capture rates, or anything else from a process standpoint? And specifically, are you seeing any issues with the reported high API gravities of the incremental barrels coming out of the Delaware Basin?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Hey, Chi, it's Lane. So it just really depends...","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi Lane.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","...certainly, in our Mid-Continent refineries, there's times that we can be \u2013 the lighter part of our refineries get constrained by these higher APIs. And then there's times where the gravity comes back in line, and we're off (53:37). And we have a longer term view that these crudes are getting lighter. We look at the same data, I'm sure, that you are, so we hit those constraints. (53:46) Now, with that said, we don't hit those constraints quite as much in our Gulf Coast refineries, because we have a little more flexibility in finding other feedstocks and crudes to blend with these things to make sure that we're always up against that constraint. So it's a little easier to optimize around these lighter crudes than it is in the Mid-Continent.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I guess, in looking at the Gulf Coast results, your index, the Valero index for the region was up, I think, $2.35 a barrel year-over-year versus 1Q last year. But the realized margin in the quarter was up only $0.35. Was that short fall in capture mainly due to the planned maintenance, or is there something else going on there?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Chi, this is Gary. I would tell you the biggest impact we had was really on the heavy feedstocks we bring into the system compared to the Maya marker that moved quite a bit, so our heavy feedstocks were more expensive relative to Maya marker. And some of that was just Maya was much more competitive in the first quarter than what we either saw in the first quarter, what we had year-over-year.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Gary, but I think you said that you're not having problems on Maya delivery, but that the pricing has tightened up. Is that fair...","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Well \u2013 yeah, the Maya pricing and deliveries were fine, but the other heavy sours that we're buying versus the Maya pricing was not as competitive in the first quarter as what we've seen previously.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Is that trend \u2013 do you think that will continue? We saw that Pemex has tighten up the K factor on Maya for May, so...?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, we see that come and go. There's times where Mexican crude is very competitive and times where they kind of fall where they're not. So, that's why we kind of have a diversified strategy on pulling the South American grades and Canadian grades. And it looks like it has come in some already. And I would expect that to come in and continue to come in.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great, thanks for your comments.","Operator","And thank you. We now have a follow up question from Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey guys. Any kind of a rough estimate in terms of the opportunity cost loss in the first quarter due to the planned and unplanned outages?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Hey, Paul, this is Lane. So, our planned outages in the first quarter was \u2013 the opportunity cost was $231 million. So as you've heard us talk, we've had \u2013 it was a fairly heavy turnaround quarter. In terms, of unplanned outages it was about $40 million.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And this is not just an expense, but also you're including the loss profit that the way how you guys calculate, right?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Loss profit and expense?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes, it includes expense.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Very good.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference maybe recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Homer Bhullar","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team.","If you\u2019ve not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments.

There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.","Joe Gorder","Thanks, Homer, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re pleased to report that we delivered solid financial results despite challenging market conditions again this quarter. Although gasoline cracks held steady and diesel cracks improved from the previous quarter. Heavy and medium sour crude all discounts the Brent crude oil remain narrow. Its supply was constrained by geopolitical events.","Also the start up of new pipelines from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast tighten the WTI Midland to Cushing crude oil differential. Despite these headwinds, we generated $1.4 billion in operating cash flow. Once again, demonstrating the flexibility and strength of our assets to deliver steady earnings and free cash flow.","During the quarter, we began to enjoy the benefits of our investments in the new Houston alkylation unit that was commissioned in June and from the recently completed Central Texas pipelines and terminals project. The alkylation unit upgrades lower value natural gas liquids and refinery olefins to a premium high octane outlet product. And the Central Texas pipelines and terminals reduce secondary costs and extends our supply chain from the Gulf Coast to a growing inland market.","Other strategic growth projects and execution remain on target. The Pasadena terminal, St. Charles alkylation unit, and Pembroke cogeneration unit are expected to be completed next year, with the Diamond Green Diesel expansion expected to be completed in 2021 and the Port Arthur Coker in 2022.","In September, our Diamond Green Diesel joint venture initiated an advanced engineering and development cost review for a new renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur Texas facility. If the projects approved, construction could begin in 2021 with operations expected to commence in 2024. This would result in Diamond Green Diesel production capacity increasing to over 1.1 billion gallons annually.","The guiding framework underpinning our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We continue to expect our annual CapEx for both 2019 and 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion with $1 billion allocated for projects with high returns that are focused on market expansion and margin improvement.","During the third quarter, we returned $679 million to stockholders, which represents a payout ratio of 61% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. We continue to target an annual payout ratio of 40% to 50%. Looking forward, we\u2019re encouraged. Fourth quarter market conditions are favorable. Distillate and gasoline margins are significantly higher than last quarter and this time last year supported by strong fundamentals, good demand and wider medium and heavy sour crude all discounts.","In closing, our team\u2019s simple strategy of striving for operational excellence, investing to drive earnings growth with lower volatility and maintaining capital discipline with an uncompromising focus on shareholder returns has proven to be successful and positions us well for any market environment.","So with that Homer, I\u2019ll hand the call back to you.","Homer Bhullar","Thanks, Joe. For the third quarter of 2019, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $609 million or $1.48 per share, compared to $856 million or $2.1 per share in the third quarter of 2018.","Operating income for the Refining segment in the third quarter of 2019 was $1.1 billion compared to $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2018. The decrease from the third quarter of 2018 is mainly attributed to narrower crude oil discounts to Brent crude oil. Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.95 million barrels per day, which was 146,000 barrels per day lower than the third quarter of 2018. Throughput capacity utilization was 94% in the third quarter of 2019. Refining cash operating expenses of $4.05 per barrel, where $0.33 per barrel higher than the third quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher maintenance activity and lower throughput in the third quarter of 2019.","The Ethanol segment generated a $43 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2019 compared to $21 million in operating income in the third quarter of 2018. The decrease from the third quarter of 2018 was primarily due to lower margins resulting from higher corn prices. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2019. Operating income for the Renewable Diesel segment was $65 million compared to $5 million operating loss in the third quarter of 2018.","Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 638,000 gallons per day in the third quarter of 2019, an increase of 387,000 gallons per day versus the third quarter of 2018. The third quarter 2018 operating results and sales volumes were impacted by the plan downtime of the Diamond Green Diesel plant as part of completing an expansion project. For the third quarter of 2019, general and administrative expenses were $217 million and net interest expense was $111 million.","Depreciation and amortization expense was $567 million and income tax expense was $165 million in the third quarter of 2019. The effective tax rate was 21%. With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $9.6 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion. Valero\u2019s debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 26%. At the end of September, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash.","With regard to investing activities, we made $525 million of capital investments in the third quarter of 2019, of which approximately $305 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts, and regulatory compliance. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Excluding the impact from the change in working capital during the quarter, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion.","Moving to financing activities, we returned $679 million to our stockholders in the third quarter. $372 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 3.9 million shares of Valero common stock. The total payout ratio was 61% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities. This brings our year-to-date return to stockholders to $1.7 billion and the total payout ratio to 54% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities.","As of September 30, we had approximately $1.7 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to expect annual capital investments for both 2019 and 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion with approximately 60% allocated to sustaining the business and approximately 40% to growth. The $2.5 billion includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalyst and joint venture investments.","For modeling our fourth quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.71 million to 1.76 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 475,000 to 495,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be approximately $3.95 per barrel.","Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4.3 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.06 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, we still expect sales volumes to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2019. Operating expenses in 2019 should be $0.45 per gallon, which includes $0.16 per gallon for non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization.","For 2019, we expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $840 million. The annual effective tax rate is estimated at 22%. For the fourth quarter, net interest expense should be about $113 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $565 million. Lastly, we still expect the RINs expense for the year to remain between $300 million and $400 million.","That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.

Do you think it\u2019s a function of just turnaround activity versus something that\u2019s the beginning of a more sustainable IMO impact and maybe it\u2019s a 30,000 foot question here is, how do you think IMO plays out versus sustainability and the depth of impact, as we think about your model over the next couple of years?","Joe Gorder","Good morning, Neil. Okay. Gary, you want to...","Gary Simmons","Yes, Neil, I think, the products cracks, it\u2019s pretty difficult to be able to determine how much of the strength in the crack is IMO-related and how much is just fundamentals and supply. But we\u2019re certainly seeing a lot of indications in the market of IMO starting to impact it. I mean the things I would point to, the diesel curve is just continued to shift higher, the closer we get to the January 2020 date.","On the gasoline market, we\u2019re seeing indications as well. Our view was that you would see some of these low-sulfur feedstock, the cat crackers being pulled out of the cats and put into the low-sulfur bunker market. If you look today, low-sulfur VGO is $5 over gasoline in the Gulf, which is to the point where you\u2019ll start to see people pull that out of cat crackers and put it into low-sulfur bunkers, which should impact gasoline yield moving forward.","And then the big thing that I think is very visible is on the feedstock side of the business. High sulfur fuel, it traded as high as 95% of Brent earlier this year. This morning trading at 61% of Brent. The forward curve on high sulfur fuel oil was backward indicating it\u2019s going to get weaker as we go forward.","And as you would expect, as high sulfur fuel oil has traded weaker we\u2019re starting to see that in the crude quality discounts. So through most of the year, we\u2019ve had heavy sour trading inside of a 10% discount to Brent. It\u2019s almost 20% discount to Brent today, Maya and WCS. I think Maya trading at 11.50% discount to Brent today. And we\u2019re seeing medium sours that get weaker as well. So I think on the feedstock side of the business, it\u2019s pretty clear, we\u2019re getting an impact not as clear, but I think we are also seeing it on the product side.","Neil Mehta","Thank you. And then the follow-up question is around renewable diesel and maybe Joe, can you just talk about how you see this part of the business fitting into your long-term strategy? And then how you think about the gating factors for adding that capacity that you talked about in the call and then anything around blender\u2019s tax credit. So a lot of pieces to that, but just if you can fill in the gaps as it relates to renewable diesel, because we think it\u2019s \u2013 it can be an important part of the story going forward.","Joe Gorder","Yes, I mean you took a book out of Paul Cheng\u2019s \u2013 page out of Paul Cheng\u2019s book here. You got first three questions there. I\u2019ll speak about part of it, I\u2019ll let Martin speak about part of it and Jason might want to cover kind of the probabilities for the blender\u2019s tax credit. But I mean strategically, we are a company that really makes motor fuels, and we\u2019re a company that takes their environmental responsibility and sustainability very seriously.","And so when we look at the opportunities to produce products where there is going to be growth in the market and they\u2019re going to have sustainably high margins, we look to renewable diesel. We just think it\u2019s a really good business. We\u2019ve got a really good partner in Darling. And it\u2019s something that we know how to do. We know how to run these processes very well. And so it fits right down the middle of our fairway and so we feel very good about not only the returns, but overall EBITDA contributions that we\u2019re going to get from this product for a very long time to come. So Martin, you want to cover a piece of it.","Martin Parrish","Sure, Joe, thanks. Yes, we\u2019re bullish on renewable diesel. We expect demand growth to be strong. You\u2019ve got the Renewable Energy Directive II in Europe now that\u2019s been extended to 2030. The California LCFS has been extended out the 2030 and calling for 20% greenhouse gas reduction in 2030. And then the recent elections in Canada would tell us, we\u2019re probably going to see a national standard in Canada, too. And then you\u2019ve got New York State. So we think the future demand for renewable diesel just looks very strong.","Joe Gorder","You want to talk about blender\u2019s tax credit?","Jason Fraser","Yes, this is Jason. I\u2019ll give you an update on the blenders\u2019 tax credit. As you all know, it expired at the end of 2017. Both Chambers of Congress have proposed legislation that would extend it. I think the Senate has got it going out for two years and this is back retroactive to 2018, and out for three negotiations on the BTC and other tax extenders are now taking place within the context of the appropriations process.","We\u2019re optimistic it will get done, because the BTC remains one of Senate Finance Chairman, Grassley\u2019s top priorities, and there\u2019s really not a lot of opposition to it. However, this impeachment process is certainly interfering with the bipartisan cooperation that you need to get the package agreed to. So that\u2019s what\u2019s created a little, a little more uncertainty than there was before.","Joe Gorder","Hey Neil, one other point I think that we\u2019d like to make on this, Martin can speak to, why isn\u2019t \u2013 why aren\u2019t we doing like 200,000 barrels a day of this, so.","Martin Parrish","I think the constraints to look at is in the late feedstock market and we\u2019re confident we can source it and we\u2019re not worried about that any time soon. But that\u2019s the ultimate constraint on this as the feedstock. The feedstock supply is tied to global GDP per person, these ways feedstocks that\u2019s increasing. So we feel good about being able to source the feedstock. And our partnership with Darling, they are a global leader in this. They process 10% of the world\u2019s meat byproducts, so we feel we\u2019re in a good place on securing the feedstock.","Neil Mehta","Appreciate all the perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Roger Read","Yes, thank you. Good morning.","Joe Gorder","Good morning, Roger.","Roger Read","Yes, couple of things to dig into a little, maybe more on the macro front. Just in terms of product demand, I recognize you can\u2019t give us absolutely clarity on what\u2019s driving what, but we\u2019ve got good cracks on even the light crude. So in spite of IMO things look better, I was just curious maybe going back to Neil\u2019s question there on how much of this might be turnarounds versus, what we\u2019re actually seeing in terms of the solid backdrop on the demand front?","Gary Simmons","Yes, Roger. So I think to me, if you look at product inventories and you roll back to early August, total light products inventory was 16 million barrels above where we were in 2018 at the same time period. Now over the last two months, we\u2019ve had significant product growth such that \u2013 the last set of stats, we were 19 million barrels below where we were in 2018. So in the period of just a couple of months, you\u2019ve had a year-over-year change in total light product inventories, at 35 million barrels, which is a pretty staggering figure.","And so if you look at that break it down, we see good demand, vehicle miles traveled look good, the tonnage index looks good. But then there is certainly some things that are supply driven as well. Shut down of PES, some planned and unplanned refinery outages have driven that as well and helps poor product fundamentals. But moving forward you look and gasoline sitting just a little above the five-year average range, diesels at the lower end of the five-year average range on apparent days of supply, both gasoline and diesel below the five-year average range. So the fundamentals look very good for both gasoline and distillate moving forward.","Roger Read","Okay, great. And then just couple of follow-up on that. We\u2019ve obviously seen this issue in the tanker market, part of that is clearly related to IMO with ships going into the dry docks for retrofitting on the scrubbers. But I was curious as we look at the risk of some of these product tankers on the clean side moving into the crude markets chasing rates, do you think would any legit risk of tightness in product tanking markets that could impact your export story as we go forward?","Gary Simmons","Yes, Roger, I think for us, most of our exports are short haul market. So we\u2019re primarily going to Mexico and South America and freight rates by get actually gives us a competitive advantage for other people trying to get to those markets. So I don\u2019t really know that it\u2019s much of a risk to us.","Roger Read","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Manav Gupta","Hi guys. I had a quick macro question first. Can you talk about \u2013 a little bit about the limitations of very low-sulfur fuel oil at this stage? I\u2019m trying to understand, would shippers be more comfortable sticking to the tried and tested marine gas oil or would they actually be looking at the very low-sulfur fuel oil as a cheaper substitute in the initial stages of IMO?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So we have a compliant blend that we are offering in the Corpus Christi market. We are also proceeding with the project, where we\u2019ll be able to have a low-sulfur blend in Pembroke. But we also have seen that there is a lot of challenges on being able to blend this 0.5 material especially with a lot of the low-sulfur Paraffinic crudes. So I think there is a good chance that initially ships will run marine gas oil and then gradually transition to the lower sulfur bunker material.","Manav Gupta","And as I understand, that would be good for the U.S. diesel demand, right, if they continue to use marine gas oil in the initial stages?","Gary Simmons","Yes, it will. And I think even with the blends we\u2019re seeing on the low-sulfur bunker material those when still contain a fairly significant percentage of distillate in the blend. And so even if they\u2019re burning the low-sulfur bunker, we still see a step change in diesel demand.","Manav Gupta","A quick follow-up is, you are running a lot of light sweet crude on the Gulf Coast, almost 770,000 barrels a day, up about 25% versus last year. I\u2019m trying to understand now that we are finally seeing sour discounts widen out. Should we think that in 4Q and going ahead, there is a little bit of a switch back-to-medium and heavies, which would also solve some of the naphtha issues you had in 2Q?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So that\u2019s exactly what we see. We set another record for light sweet crude processing in the third quarter. The economic signals were strongly in favor of light sweet crude. We\u2019ve been saying that we are at 1.6 million barrels a day of overall capacity and we pretty much fully utilized that in the third quarter. But certainly with the widening of the quality discount, especially the heavy sour crude are favored and we\u2019re starting to see medium sour crudes become economic as well.","Manav Gupta","Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on another good quarter. Thank you.","Joe Gorder","Thanks, Manav. Take care.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Phil Gresh","Hey, good morning. A bit of a follow-up to Manav\u2019s question here, just in terms of your slate on the Gulf Coast, how do you think about, your ability to run high sulfur fuel oil as a feedstock? I think residuals have been about 200,000 barrels a day or so, each of the past few quarters. How much of that is high sulfur fuel oil and what kind of flexibility do you have to run more as a feedstock?","Gary Simmons","So we have a lot of flexibility to do that and we have been doing some of it backing out high sulfur or heavy sour crude. And we haven\u2019t really been running high sulfur fuel, but we\u2019ve been running blend components that are going into the high sulfur fuel oil market. We\u2019ve run some of those and we expect to do more as we move forward.","Phil Gresh","Okay. And then second question, obviously there is a change to the Maya formula, but obviously Maya has to be competitive regardless of what the formula is. I\u2019m just curious how you think about \u2013 how these heavy barrels on the Gulf Coast need the price, especially WCS, which seems to be discounting more, as more barrels are coming via rail, but also then you have the Middle Eastern barrels, you have the medium sours. So how do you think about how these should all price relative to each other?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So we believe heavy Canadian in Maya should trade at approximately the same value. Obviously in September, PMI expected high sulfur fuel oil to trade much weaker and the formula had Maya really priced out of the market. But they made a correction in October and if you look at where both WCS and Maya are trading today, they are almost on top of each other, which is where we expect those to trade moving forward.","Phil Gresh","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joe Gorder","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Our next question comes from Prashant Rao with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Prashant Rao","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Joe Gorder","Good morning, Prashant.","Prashant Rao","Good morning, Joe. After following up on Phil\u2019s question there, price on Maya and WCS is one factor and relatively how those are on top of each other. In market access, the barrels are moving down of the Gulf is another, as we look to Canada talking about rail above curtailment, we\u2019re starting to see \u2013 end of the curtailment start to roll off a little bit. It looks like, could we get a more Brent barrels of Canadian into the Gulf Coast market?","I just wanted to get a sense of what you\u2019re seeing out there and maybe give us a sense of what you can get on sort of a firm versus delivered basis for barrels and how does that play any further into kind of that Maya versus U.S. dynamic pricing of the curve?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So we\u2019re in ongoing negotiations with several producers in Western Canada on delivered rail volume. We have our Lucas rail facility that feed support Arthur refinery and a lot of capacity to run-heavy Canadian there. And we anticipate as we move through the fourth quarter, you will see rail volumes ramp up as \u2013 and we anticipate we\u2019ll buy those barrels delivered on something equivalent to the WCS or Maya equivalent in the Gulf.","Prashant Rao","Okay, great. And then other factor, another question is just a follow-up on the ethanol, that\u2019s a smaller segment, but I just wanted to get a sense of how you see the next couple of quarters playing out? And when we could start to see potentially EBIT going back into the black on ethanol? What do we need to see to sort of give us the first time post that that\u2019s swings to the positive, because obviously that could be incremental upside there too in the quarter\u2019s ahead if factors play out right?","Martin Parrish","So this is Martin. I think near-term October is looking a lot better than the third quarter did. What you\u2019ve seen is the recent DoE data. What the issue has been is oversupply in the U.S. right. Inventory is just too low, which is pressuring margins. The production is trending lower, ethanol inventory now on the weekly data is 2.5 million barrels lower than this time last year.","And then long-term, we\u2019re still bullish. Ethanol is going to be in the U.S. gasoline mix for the long run. We expect to see some small incremental demand in the U.S. from higher octane and fuel efficiency standards and some small incremental demand from year round E15 sales. And then we expect, really the big thing we expect is a rebound and the export growth due to favorable blend economics, just the economics to blending ethanol and then these global renewable fuel mandates. So we still feel very constructive in the long-term and think that\u2019s going to be around the corner.","Prashant Rao","All right, thank you very much for the time. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotia Howard Weil. Your line is now open.","Paul Cheng","Hey guys, good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hi, Paul.","Paul Cheng","I think I have two questions. One, maybe is for Gary, I think. So I would try to stick to just two, not multiple. That before we sit, Gary, you mentioned that you haven\u2019t really fit the high sulfur, we sit directly to the Coker. Is that something that you guys believe technically, given the way economic you can do? And does it matter whether it\u2019s a delayed Coker or as a forward Coker.","Lane Riggs","Hey Paul, it\u2019s Lane. We\u2019ve historically ran quite a \u2013 what Gary was talking about was we run a lot of outside blend stocks that go into a 3.5% fuel oil and we\u2019ve always done that. And it\u2019s a part of the market that we feel like we understand technically maybe better than a lot of the people in the industry.","And one of the critical strategy is going into this, towards going in IMO have to make sure you keep connectivity between these feedstocks and the heavy crudes and we work really hard at doing that. There are technical challenges. They are around defaulting and some of the other things, but we are very focused on increasing amount of heavy sours that we run.","Paul Cheng","Lane, so you\u2019re saying that you won the heavy sour, the crude or you won the heavy sour we see, I\u2019m sorry?","Lane Riggs","We do both, but your question was around resid and...","Paul Cheng","Right.","Lane Riggs","So the earlier question was, are you running more fuel oil and we don\u2019t really run fuel oil per se. What we run is we run the blend stocks that go into 3.5%. And so as you see that as people unwind that as a fuel, you\u2019re going to see more of these components around the world become available. And the key is going out there and understanding and technically and fitting into our system, which we\u2019re working very aggressively to do that.","Paul Cheng","How about the second part of my question, whether that make any difference that \u2013 whether it\u2019s a fully Coker or delayed Coker and your ability to won those?","Lane Riggs","Not really.","Paul Cheng","Not really, okay. And that Joe for \u2013 you have strong cash flow and continue to do so. Your balance sheet is in good shape, but given the uncertainty in the economy. Will that makes sense to move part of the free cash to pay down debt to really draw down the debt to a much lower level at some point that we may get hit by recession, we don\u2019t know when, but at some point in may?","Joe Gorder","Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Paul. I will let Donna speak to that.","Donna Titzman","No, I actually think our balance sheet is in good shape. We do have additional debt capacity to go. I don\u2019t think our ratings are in jeopardy. We have good liquidity today. So again, I\u2019m not \u2013 don\u2019t believe that paying down debt right now is necessary.","Joe Gorder","Yes, there is really nothing to tell, Paul\u2026","Donna Titzman","Well, it\u2019s very expensive. You\u2019re right, our next maturity is in 2025 and to try to get that called early with the expensive and uneconomical to us.","Paul Cheng","That\u2019s it. Thank you.","Joe Gorder","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate","Thank you and good morning everyone. Good morning, Joe.","Joe Gorder","How are you doing Doug?","Homer Bhullar","How are you Doug?","Doug Leggate","I should probably thank Paul for making room for the rest of us, so I thank them as well. So, I just go two quick questions, Joe. Obviously, IMO is the focus for the whole market right now. My question really is more about, this year perspective on duration of any perceived benefit. To give it, to explain my question will further, our view is that the industry can react to the product side it, with things like your VGO, reallocation and things of that nature. The stickier side of it seems to be on the sour feedstock.","So I just want to get your perspective as do you think that the product side of it is more sticky as well? In which case, what does it mean for like gasoline balance given what you described in your prepared remarks about VGO? Maybe explain your experience of what you\u2019ve done with VGO and how you expect to operate going forward? And I\u2019ve got a quick follow-up please.","Joe Gorder","Okay. Gary and Lane can speak to this. You know, Paul, I mean, Doug, excuse me, if you recall probably for 18 months or something, we\u2019ve been talking about the first \u2013 the prospects from IMO and it\u2019s kind of shaping up the way that we had anticipated. The one issue and the guys can speak to this in addition to your question is, how do you solve the circumstances that IMO creates in the market, okay. Who comes in and solves the problem around the 3.5% weight fuel oil? So you guys want to speak to it in general and then\u2026","Lane Riggs","Yes, I\u2019ll start and then of course, Gary, can always tune it up a little bit later here, we \u2013 Joe alluded to this, we sort of played out the way that we thought, and I think ultimately early on, you\u2019re going to have this demand for diesel. It will be interesting to see how long that goes. I mean, it could go on for quite some time depending on the technical difficulty of making those fuels. And we have seen some of that like Gary alluded to it. It is not an easy task to create to make all the fuels work from a compatibility perspective. But longer term, the 3.5% weight, I\u2019m making that not having a home for it is a much \u2013 the capital \u2013 a much more capital intensive thing to try to work through.","And somebody alluded \u2013 was asking the question earlier about valuations of crude. What will be interesting is, right now, I would say these crudes are \u2013 to the extent that heavy sour and medium sour are running not \u2013 they\u2019re not being value based on an open culture, but they\u2019re being valued based on 3.5% weight. You could see it \u2013 you\u2019re going to see that disconnect even get greater. I don\u2019t know that we know \u2013 you can think about all the path to try to close that gap, but it all takes quite a bit of capital.","Gary Simmons","Yes, I think a lot of uncertainty. We certainly anticipated, you\u2019d see scrubbers come online, but it appears there\u2019s a lot of technical issues around the scrubbers that maybe they don\u2019t come on as fast as what we thought. And then the other area here that would uncertainty is when does some of this production that\u2019s offline, some of these medium and heavy sour crudes, when do they come back on the market. So very difficult to give you a timeline.","Joe Gorder","But it\u2019s...","Doug Leggate","I think you were trying to answer it, go on Joe, sorry.","Joe Gorder","It\u2019s not a problem that\u2019s going to get resolved very quickly. I think, again we\u2019ve always kind of played down the whole product side of this, but I think we\u2019ve expected more on the feedstock side. We\u2019re seeing it in both right now, but this is going to take a while to solve.","Doug Leggate","Thanks for attempting to answer guys. I know it\u2019s a really tough one, but obviously constructive for you guys in particular. My follow-up and either Joe or Donna, whoever wants to take this, but the balance between buybacks and dividends, specific to Valero, you\u2019re operating better than any other refinery in the industry, frankly, in terms of your execution, you reliability, in terms of markets. You know consistency of delivering to the market, but your buyback and dividend is still pretty skewed I guess. What is the right level for that, especially as your share price goes up? I know you\u2019ve always been pretty sensitive to buying back stock. When you get some kind of periodic strengthening in margins and obviously the industry. So do we see a step-up in the dividend or maybe a rebalancing of how you return cash? And I\u2019ll leave it there, thanks.","Joe Gorder","Yes, I\u2019ll let Donna talk to this. Because \u2013 I mean, Doug, obviously there is not a formulaic approach to how you do this, right. I mean, you\u2019ve going to have your outlook for the market going forward. Obviously, we felt it has been pretty good, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had a significant dividend increases. We have had \u2013 and you want to be competitive from a yield perspective, not only with your peers but with the broader market. So all those things taken into consideration, but not as far as the mix\u2026","Donna Titzman","Yes, so I mean we do view that dividend as it is very important part of the total shareholder return, but it\u2019s also important to us that it is sustainable. So we want it to be very competitive in the market generally and specifically against our peers. But we also want to be able to sustain that dividend through the earnings cycle. So we always continue to look at that mix. We always continue to review it.","Joe Gorder","Yes. And you noticed that we did more on the buyback side this quarter than we did the previous quarter. And we haven\u2019t altered our approach and when we say, we look at ratability plus, we look at buying on dips and frankly we had a situation where we\u2019re looking into a strong fourth quarter with the prospects for IMO. We said it\u2019s a good time to buy back more shares. So that\u2019s what we did in the third quarter. So we took advantage of an opportunity, and we\u2019ll do that going forward.","Doug Leggate","Would we expect the buyback to slow if you did \u2013 let\u2019s say, you were 20% higher, would you still be buying back your shares?","Joe Gorder","If we were 20% higher, it all goes to...","Doug Leggate","As you know, it\u2019s a cyclical business obviously. So you buy back. You know at some point is going to drop again probably, so I guess, how do you respond to continue strengthening?","Joe Gorder","So, well, we are going to adhere to our 40% to 50% payout ratio. And Doug, it doesn\u2019t make sense in this business to jostle things around on an ongoing basis. You set your target and you work to achieve and it gives you consistency, not only with what the financial markets are going to expect from you, but operationally what you can afford to invest in and how you can grow the business. And so that\u2019s why we said this, capital allocation framework in place several years ago and we have adhered to it totally since then and it seems to work out. So don\u2019t make any forecast dividend increases and at all, we just rely on the fact that we had told you what we\u2019re going to do and we\u2019re going to do it.","Doug Leggate","Great answer. Thanks Joe. Appreciate it.","Joe Gorder","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Sam Margolin","Good morning everybody, hi.","Joe Gorder","Hi, Sam.","Sam Margolin","I have a follow-up on renewable diesel actually. It\u2019s \u2013 the location of the project you\u2019re evaluating a Port Arthur, in the context of the comment around feedstock constraints, can you just talk a little bit about why that location is a good one? It seems like you operate in places that might have more local biomass. Are you importing or is it the marketing thing or you\u2019re exporting? I\u2019m asking because as this business scales be good to know just sort of the factors that you look at for performance?","Martin Parrish","Yes, this is Martin. I mean the thing that helps renewable diesel is being co-located with the refinery. So that\u2019s probably the primary thing we\u2019re looking at and in place where we can hit all the markets. So that really drives you to the Gulf Coast and were driven in the United States just because of the \u2013 the feedstock supply in the U.S. per installed base of renewable diesel is better than anywhere else in the world. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re heading to reviewing Port Arthur and doing the engineering analysis on it.","Sam Margolin","Okay, thanks. So it\u2019s a combination of placement and feedstock, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then, we\u2019re like six weeks since the uptake stabilizer went down in Saudi, people who count the ships coming out of the Gulf see stable exports. But can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing as far as high sulfur to sour crude supply, if there\u2019s been any change in mix from the Middle East as far as feedstock quality or crude quality that you\u2019re seeing in the interim here as that facility gets repaired?","Gary Simmons","Yes, Sam, this is Gary. We haven\u2019t really purchased any Saudi volume in quite some time. And so I can\u2019t really give you a comment. We\u2019re running some Iraqi and Kuwait. It\u2019s primarily due to the West Coast, which has been unaffected, but we don\u2019t see any Saudi volume coming into our system at all.","Sam Margolin","All right. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC. Your line is now open.","Brad Heffern","Hi, everyone. Question on exports. So when I was looking at the numbers for last year for the third quarter, I think you guys exported over 400,000 barrels a day. This year was just a little over 300,000, is that demand pull into the U.S. Is that export weakness or is there some other factor that I\u2019m not thinking of?","Joe Gorder","Yes, Brad. I think you kind of hit on it. The only thing I would tell you is, Port Arthur is one of our large export locations and we were doing some dredging work on the dock there, which did limit us a little bit, but the big driver was what you pointed to, that\u2019s an optimization for us and it is demand pull and with the large life product inventory draws we saw in the U.S., we had a better net back going into the domestic markets and that\u2019s what drove it rather than lack of demand into the export markets.","Brad Heffern","Okay, got it. And then a question on refining OpEx. So this quarter just phenomenal number was $1.1 billion. When I think back a couple of years ago it used to be in the 900s or even the high 800 sometimes. Is there any underlying factor that\u2019s driven at higher OpEx number?","Joe Gorder","It\u2019s easier for me to sort of compare it to year-over-year by the way rigs. Our volumes were down in the third quarter, largely we had three external power failure, then we had the storm deal with they went through and affected our Port Arthur operations. Our volumes weren\u2019t as high as they were with these, part of that is just on per barrel basis, it\u2019s a little bit higher and then some other thing. We\u2019ve changed what is in and out of our operations and we did have the MLP out, now it\u2019s back in. We have Diamond Green Diesel, which used to be in, it\u2019s out. So there are some changes like that has occurred over time as well.","Brad Heffern","Okay, nothing structural?","Joe Gorder","No, nothing structural.","Brad Heffern","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Jason Gabelman","Yes, hi, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow-up on something Roger Read asked around, the higher shipping rates. Obviously, there are some near-term volatility in those rates, but I think the market is expecting shipping rates both on the crude and product side to be structurally higher than they were in kind of the first half of this year. Can you just talk from a totality perspective for Valero, how those higher rates impact the Company\u2019s earnings? I guess both on the product side and maybe lifting global refining margins and then also on the feedstock side in higher blended feedstock costs? Thanks.","Gary Simmons","Sure. I\u2019ll start on the feedstock side. Obviously with the \u2013 we\u2019ve been running, we\u2019re running a lot of pipeline delivered crude and then a lot of the barrels were getting over the water, short haul barrel. So we don\u2019t see a big impact on our feedstock costs and similarly on the products, the barrels are going in the domestic markets, or we export to fairly short haul locations in Mexico and South America. So not a material impact. Some of the long-haul barrels that we do run, we do have some freight protection on those as well, which helps.","Obviously, the big thing that we\u2019ve seen is been positive to the business, as freight rates is spiked, Joe mentioned in his opening comments that the Brent TI spread had come in with the pipeline capacity coming online, but with the freight rates spiking we\u2019ve seen Brent TI blow back out some and back over $5, which obviously gives U.S. refining a significant advantage on running light sweet crude. And as I mentioned previously into our export location, when you\u2019re going to Mexico, the higher freight rates actually give us a competitive advantage over some of our global refining competitors trying to import to those markets.","Jason Gabelman","All right, thanks for that. I appreciate that color. And then if I could ask just on the Syncrude marketing kind of the northern crude market, because I know you guys run a decent amount Syncrude to Quebec. It seems like there\u2019s going to be some changes in the balances in terms of and operator maybe using less Syncrude for diluent and then the Northwest refinery up there switching from running Syncrude to WCS. Do you see a shift in kind of the pricing paradigm for Syncrude and maybe that bleeding into Bakken, emerging over the next few months into 2020?","Gary Simmons","Well, it\u2019s interesting. Syncrude obviously in an IMO environment could be a premium price crude. So we have a lot of optimization opportunities on what we spent through line nine and I think our view would probably see \u2013 we see a little bit more Bakken than we see syn going to Quebec as we move forward in an IMO environment.","Jason Gabelman","All right, thanks a lot.","Joe Gorder","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Flam with Simmons Energy. Your line is now open.","Patrick Flam","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. My first question is basically, I was hoping you guys could frame up your thoughts around the recent proposed changes to the RFS program. Obviously, you guys are partially hedged to any changes by way of your ethanol and bio-diesel operations, but it seems like any reallocation of volumes lost to small refinery exemptions, would kind of come back on you as a larger operators? I was hoping you could give some context to those changes politically?","Joe Gorder","All right. Jason is on.","Jason Fraser","Yes, hi, this is Jason. You\u2019re right. On October 15th, the EPA released their supplemental RVO asking for public comment on, included in the formula the prior three years average of SREs, but the DOE recommended be granted. I know that a lot of words there. That\u2019d be about 580 million gallons or 770 million gallons. To put it on which prior three years to use and they ask for comments on both. And then these obligations will be reobligated on the other non-exempt refiners in addition to your normal share. You should get what you already get and then you get this on top.","So our industry and many members of Congress have been clear that reallocating SREs on the other obligated parties like this is unworkable and we view it as a violation of fundamental fairness to those of us who already bearing our burden onto the program. It then may also be illegal. It\u2019s especially frustrating because it has been shown time and again by the EIA on data that granting this SREs in the past, as they\u2019ve done it with no reallocation has no negative effect on ethanol blending on actual liquid volume they got moved, but this is simply no real ethanol demand destruction.","Joe Gorder","So the reallocation, he was asking about the impact of the reallocation on us, so the SREs, I mean it obviously is going to cost more for us to comply with a larger volume obligation. It\u2019s not, I wouldn\u2019t call it material, but if it was $0.01, we wouldn\u2019t like it. So anyway, we\u2019re going to do what we can to help deal with this.","Patrick Flam","Okay, great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. My second question is kind of a more detailed question back on the Diamond Green Diesel segment. It appears that in the third quarter sales volume came in pretty low and in order to meet that 750,000 gallons a day, full-year target, it seems like the fourth quarter will have to step up pretty materially. Is there any context, you can give around why that might be the case?","Jason Fraser","We had guidance for the full year of 750,000 and we still expect to make that. We expect a strong fourth quarter. We had a scheduled catalyst change in the third quarter and that\u2019s why we guided the 750,000 gallons per day for the year to begin with. So we feel pretty good about the numbers.","Patrick Flam","Okay, great. Thank you.","Joe Gorder","Thanks, Patrick.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now open.","Matthew Blair","Hey, good morning everyone. I was hoping you could give a sense of how your 2020 turnaround schedule compares to 2019?","Lane Riggs","Hi, Matthew. This is Lane Riggs. We don\u2019t give any real forward guidance to our turnaround schedule of the policy.","Matthew Blair","Okay. And then West Coast cracks got off to a great start in Q4, it have come down a little bit here. How have your two California refineries run so far this quarter and would you expect to capture all this upside?","Lane Riggs","Yes. This is Lane again. We ran pretty \u2013 we ran well and we continue to run well. We had one small blip on our San Francisco area refinery, but other than that it wasn\u2019t that meaningful to the performance around, they\u2019ve been for run a pretty well through all this.","Matthew Blair","Sounds good. Thanks.","Operator","I\u2019m showing no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr. Bhuller for closing remarks.","Homer Bhullar","Thanks guys. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Obviously, please feel free to reach out to the IR team if you have any further questions. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"21553":["Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call January 31, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives","John Locke - Vice President, Investor Relations","Joe Gorder - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer","Mike Ciskowski - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations and Engineering","Jay Browning - Executive Vice President and General Counsel","Gary Simmons - Senior Vice President, Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Jason Fraser - Vice President, Public Policy & Strategic Planning","Rich Lashway - Vice President, Logistics Operations","Analysts","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets","Phil Gresh - JPMorgan","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs","Doug Leggate - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Johannes Van Der Tuin - Credit Suisse","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Roger Read - Wells Fargo","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt","Spiro Dounis - UBS Securities","Jeff Dietert - Simmons","Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research","Operator","Welcome to the Valero Energy Corporation Reports 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. My name is Vanessa and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Locke","Well, good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call. I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks.","Joe Gorder","Thanks, John and good morning everyone. The fourth quarter and the full year 2016 were good for Valero as we achieved our best performance ever in the areas of personnel and process safety, plant reliability, and environmental stewardship. We are very proud of our team\u2019s exceptional execution, which we believe is imperative in our business and critical during the low margin environment like we saw for most of the year.","In the fourth quarter, we continued to see good domestic demand supported by low prices and solid export volumes due primarily to demand strength in Latin America. While we saw seasonal declines in available margin in some regions, margins in the Gulf Coast region remained healthy and distillate margins in all regions were bolstered by a return to more normal weather patterns in North America and Europe. We also saw attractive heavy sour discounts relative to Brent. A persistent headwind again this quarter was the exorbitant price of RINs. We spent $217 million in the fourth quarter to meet our biofuel blending obligations. At this level, this is a significant issue for us so we continue to work it aggressively with regulators. Our efforts are focused on moving the point of obligation because we believe this will level the playing field among refiners and retailers, but more importantly, it will improve the penetration of renewable fuels, lower RIN speculation, and reduce RIN fraud. However, based on current rules, we expect costs in 2017 to be similar to the $750 million amount we incurred last year. Given significance of this cost to our company, this issue continues to have our full attention.","Turning to our refining segment, we initiated turnarounds at our Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries in the third quarter. Both events carried over into and were completed in the fourth quarter. Our employees and contractors worked hard to safely complete these events. We believe distinctive operating performance is highly correlated to capturing more of the margin available in the market. In our ethanol business, we also ran very well and saw strong margins in the fourth quarter due to high gasoline demand in the U.S., strong pull from export markets, and low corn prices.","Also in the fourth quarter, we invested over $600 million to sustain and grow our business. Construction continued on our $450 million Diamond Pipeline project, which we believe is on track for completion at the end of this year, and we continue to work on our $300 million Houston alkylation unit, which we expect to be mechanically complete in the first half of 2019. We also have additional growth investment opportunities under development around octane enhancement, cogeneration, and feedstock flexibility.","And finally, regarding cash return to stockholders, we delivered a payout ratio of 142% of our 2016 adjusted net income, which was 78% higher than our payout ratio for 2015 and well above our target for 2016. Further demonstrating our belief in Valero\u2019s earnings power, last week our Board of Directors approved a 17% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share or $2.80 annually.","So John, with that, I will hand the call back over to you.","John Locke","Thank you, Joe. For the fourth quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $367 million or $0.81 per share compared to $298 million or $0.62 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $862 million or $1.79 per share. For 2016, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.3 billion or $4.94 per share compared to $4 billion or $7.99 per share in 2015. 2016 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.7 billion or $3.72 per share compared to $4.6 billion or $9.24 per share for 2015.","Please refer to the reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts as shown on Page 3 of the financial tables that our company released. Operating income for the refining segment in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $715 million compared to $876 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $1.5 billion. The decline from the 2015 adjusted amount was primarily due to narrower discounts for most sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent, weaker gasoline margins in some regions, and higher RINs prices.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Our refineries operated at 95% throughput capacity utilization in the fourth quarter of 2016 with major turnarounds at the Port Arthur and Ardmore refineries completed early in the quarter. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.83 per barrel were $0.36 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2015 primarily due to favorable property tax settlements and adjustments in 2015 and higher energy cost in 2016.","The ethanol segment generated $126 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $37 million. The increase from the 2015 adjusted amount was due primarily to lower corn prices and higher ethanol prices.","For the fourth quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $208 million and net interest expense was $112 million. Net interest expense was lower than guidance due to prepayment penalties associated with the early redemption of the 2017 notes being reflected in other income. Depreciation and amortization expense was $468 million and the effective tax rate was 21% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate was lower than expected due primarily to stronger than projected relative earnings contribution from our international operations that have lower statutory rates and other items as referenced in the release.","With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $8 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.8 billion, of which $71 million was held by VLP. Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 23%. We have $5.6 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $720 million was available for only VLP. We generated $998 million of cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter. With regard to investing activities, we made $628 million of capital investments, of which $244 million was for turnarounds and catalysts. For 2016, we invested $2 billion, which was slightly lower than guidance due to lower turnaround costs and the timing of some growth spending. And of this total, $1.4 billion was for sustaining and $600 million was for growth.","Moving to financing activities, we returned $440 million in cash to our stockholders in the fourth quarter, which included $271 million in dividend payments and $169 million for the purchase of 2.7 million shares of Valero common stock. For 2016, we purchased 23.3 million shares for $1.3 billion and had approximately $2.5 billion of authorization remaining. For 2017, we maintain our guidance of $2.7 billion for capital investments, including turnarounds, catalysts, and joint venture investments. This consists of approximately $1.6 billion for sustaining and $1.1 billion for growth.","For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges; U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.63 million to 1.68 million barrels per day, U.S. Mid-Continent at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 195,000 to 215,000 barrels per day, which reflects a major turnaround at the Venetia refinery and North Atlantic at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.15 per barrel, which reflects projected increased natural gas prices. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.39 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. We expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation for the first quarter to be around $175 million and net interest expense should be about $115 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $485 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be around 30%.","That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions each. This will help us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern","Good morning everyone.","Joe Gorder","Good morning Brad.","Brad Heffern","Hey Joe. So I was wondering, obviously a big topic of conversation has been the border adjustment tax in the space, so can you go through your thoughts on how that\u2019s going to affect feedstock costs, your ability to pass it on and maybe the likelihood that you see if that\u2019s actually making it through?","Joe Gorder","Yes, you bet. We will give you a point of view. What I would like to do is let Jason Fraser answer that question. Jason has recently taken the position as the individual responsible for our public policy and strategic planning group, so we brought him back from London to take on this job. And it\u2019s interesting we put the two functions together, strategic planning and public policy, because in our view you really can\u2019t bifurcate the two anymore. They are going to be very intertwined. So Jason, you want to go ahead and share your point of view?","Jason Fraser","Sure. Yes. I will give you a heads-up on where we are with the house tax blueprint. And we have read all of your reports. As you know, there are greatly differing opinions on the blueprints, including the border tax, border adjustment tax aspect, how it affects our industry, and Valero. We are performing our own analysis as well as working through scenarios with AFPM, our trade association. We are also engaged with the legislative process. We are at the very early stages. No legislative tax has been released by the ways and means committee yet, so we are not sure exactly what\u2019s going to be in it. But we are going to continue to work this issue. Regarding the likelihood of passage, you guys know that any kind of major legislative change like this is difficult to pass. If there isn\u2019t bipartisan support, the Republicans may have to use the budget reconciliation process. We also have a new administration which adds another variable. So it\u2019s really hard to handicap at this stage how it\u2019s likely to turn out.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thanks for that. And then Joe or maybe Gary or Lane, the South Coast AQMD in California has talked about potentially banning the use of hydrofluoric acid, I was curious if you know what the impact will potentially be on Wilmington and maybe the chance of that going through as well?","Lane Riggs","So Brad, this is Lane. So yes, we are engaged in the process and there is obviously a conversation around it. And I can\u2019t really share much more than that than it does impact our operations, so we did have an HF unit [ph] there as long as the operator there in Torrance, and there are technologies out there. Obviously, the most straightforward one is the sulfuric acid, but there is also one of the other technology providers in the space has another solution and \u2013 but we are certainly working with them in terms of how long it might take to \u2013 if they choose to go down that path and how long that \u2013what the phase-in or at least the requirement would be, but we are very involved.","Brad Heffern","Okay. I will leave it there. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh","Hey, good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hi Phil.","Phil Gresh","I just wanted to start with the return of capital, obviously the year ended up north of 140%, you are guiding to 75%, which is consistent with the guidance you have always said, but there is obviously a big delta between those two numbers, so I guess, I am wondering how you are thinking about that target relative to what you accomplished in 2016 and just taking note of the fact that 4Q did step down a bit from the rest of the year on the buybacks?","Mike Ciskowski","Okay. Phil, this is Mike. We continue to spend our discretionary cash according to our capital allocation framework. When we look at how much we are going to buyback in a particular quarter, we do look at the net income, but we also consider cash flow, and so for the quarter or for 2016, we did have 142% of net income and that equated to 51% of cash flow.","Phil Gresh","It\u2019s okay. So you are suggesting we should consider cash flow as a metric as well?","Mike Ciskowski","Well, not suggesting that as our overall guidance, but in a lower margin environment where net income is hit with our depreciation, we do take that into consideration when we are returning to our shareholders.","Joe Gorder","Phil and we have talked about this before, we set the 75% target because it\u2019s easy to see and cash flow can move around, obviously. And Mike is right, looking at net income in a low-margin environment, we set an expectation and we consider it to be kind of the floor. It\u2019s our commitment to our shareholders to the extent we can do more and it\u2019s the best use for the cash, we will go ahead and continue to buyback shares. I think the move we made with the dividend this quarter clearly reflects our comfort level and our Board\u2019s comfort level with the earnings capability of the company in a down market. And so obviously, if you look at a $2.80 dividend, it\u2019s going to continue to be a more significant component of the 75% payout ratio. We are very comfortable with that. But we will continue to buyback shares and the guys will do it in the way they have done it in the past, to some extent ratably and to some extent opportunistically.","Phil Gresh","Sure. Okay, that makes sense. And if I could maybe push a little bit more on Brad\u2019s question, more from the angle of if something were to happen, maybe just talk through your system, the amount of crude you import, the amount of product you export, you gave some numbers on product exports, but maybe just what changes you think you would potentially make if this were indeed implemented?","Joe Gorder","Yes. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 and I will let Gary and Jason and Lane can \u2013 we can all speak to this. But obviously, you are going to optimize your crude slate. The big question around this whole border adjustment is how are the markets going to react to it and frankly, we have read everyone of the sell side reports on this and then consulting reports, as Jason mentioned and it\u2019s got a lot of moving parts. Some people look at it on a static basis. Some have looked at it when you take into consideration the markets adjusting and some have taken into consideration the currency adjustment also. So right now, there is a skeleton out there that they are trying to put flesh on and we don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s going to look like. But I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are going to continue to optimize our operation. And if you recall, Gary, I don\u2019t remember how long ago, but we are running over 1 million barrels a day of light sweet crude and there has been times when we have run 600,000 or 700,000 barrels a day of light sweet crude. So, Phil, we have got the flexibility in the system. Gary, you want to talk at all about the markets and...","Gary Simmons","Yes. So if you just look really over the last several years, our strategic objectives have been around developing feedstock flexibility and developing export markets. And so we believe that puts us in a really good position to be able to handle whatever the border tax may throw our way.","Phil Gresh","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","Good morning, guys.","Joe Gorder","Hi, Neil.","Neil Mehta","Joe, I want to start off on the product markets here. We have seen couple of weeks of gasoline inventory builds. I want to just get your sense of what you think is going on there? Is there an issue with underlying gasoline demand? And how do you see it playing out from here?","Joe Gorder","Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Neil. Gary, you want to share your thoughts? ","Gary Simmons","Yes. Neil, I guess to me when you look at the DOE numbers, it\u2019s always difficult this early in the year to tell a lot from the numbers. But certainly, when you look at gasoline demand, we were trending below last year\u2019s level. Last week stat showed gasoline demand really at the lower end of the 5-year range. The part to me, though, when you look at implied demand, which includes the exports, implied demand is actually tracking above last year\u2019s level, which is a little confusing. It\u2019s certainly confusing to us when we look at our operations, because what we have seen in our operations in the Gulf is we have had a number of weather impacts in the Gulf, primarily fog, which has hindered our visibility to really load ships, which hinders our ability to do the exports. So at least, in our minds, the exports in the DOEs are probably overstated, which would in turn tell you that domestic demand is understated. And so I think you will see a revision in the stats to where exports will be lowered and the domestic demand raise, but we will have to see how that plays out. Really, when you look regionally, we don\u2019t see any indication to believe that domestic demand is down. You have a few locations. We had high levels of rain on the West Coast, which hindered our demand there. You had some instances in the Upper Midwest with some ice storms, but none of that is abnormal. So I don\u2019t think we see anything that tells us demand this year is going to be dramatically different than what we saw last year.","Neil Mehta","And then so Gary, what do you make of the inventory builds, is that just a function of fog and having some issues getting the product out or the refining industry running too hard in response to the strong crack to end the year last year?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So I would say PADD III is definitely is a result of fog. And weather clears and you will start to see the PADD III market clear. Obviously, the concern is the PADD I market. And our hope certainly was, with less carry in the market, you would see less of an incentive to put barrels into New York harbor and store them for summer. And really, we have been on a similar trajectory is what we were last year. I think the only thing that we see that\u2019s different in the market we don\u2019t have a lot of line of sight to the barrels people are putting into tanks, but it does look to us like a lot more of the inventory this year is a winter grade gasoline which if that\u2019s true you should see play out is before RVP transition, people will have to liquidate those barrels and the market will get a little soft, but then you should see inventory cleanup before you get to gasoline season. To your comment, I do think part of this is obviously the utilization rates are just too high and we are producing more diesel and gasoline than the market can absorb. When you look at the Northwest Europe crack, it looks like this week we have gone below a level where we generally start to see some run cuts in Northwest Europe. I also believe regionally, the Rocky Mountain region, the Upper Midwest Chicago market, those markets are long and you will see some run cuts there. So, you combine that with turnaround activity and I think you will start to see inventories come back in line.","Neil Mehta","That\u2019s great. And my follow-up here is for Cisco, there are lot of puts and takes in the quarter. Do you mind walking through the tax rate, which was a little bit lower, the interest expense guidance, which was a little bit different and some funkiness in other income?","Mike Ciskowski","Okay. Yes, Neil, I can do that. Okay. First, on our tax rate for the quarter, we were 21% versus our guidance of 31%. We had a couple of things going on there. First, we had higher income than previously projected with most of this being in Canada and the UK, which has the lower statutory tax rate. So that was worth about 3% on the tax rate. Next on a few of our tax audits, the statute of limitations expired, therefore, we reversed reserves associated with these audits and those reversals, along with a few other small adjustments was about 7% on our tax rate. Okay. We had a few items that we did -- we chose not to identify them as special items for this earnings call, but I will walk through those. First and you talked about one already, the debt prepayment penalty. We inadvertently on our last call included that penalty in interest expense. It actually flowed through other income. That was a charge of about $42 million. Offsetting that, however, was kind of a unique item. It\u2019s the Canadian commercial paper recovery. Back in 2009, we wrote off that investment. Part of the deal, we exchanged our commercial paper for some notes. And in the fourth quarter, we received payment on those notes and that was about $50 million. So, those two kind of offset each other in other income. And then lastly, we had in the fourth quarter a LIFO charge. We had a decrement and we had a LIFO charge of about $55 million. So we chose not to identify any of these four items as a special, but I did want to go over that. So in summary, we had two expense items, the debt prepayment and the LIFO charge. We had one income item, commercial paper recovery and then we had the lower tax rates. So when you net those four items together, that was $0.02 per share on our earnings.","Neil Mehta","That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.","Mike Ciskowski","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Joe, one of the other, I guess, policy moving parts that has emerged in the last week or so is Keystone. Of course, OPEC, the newswires should suggest it\u2019s heavy barrels that are getting cut. So, I am just wondering what can you share with us about the dynamics of what you are seeing on the Gulf Coast specifically as it relates to how you expect the heavy differential at this kind to evolve over the next uncertain periods, I guess, that we have?","Gary Simmons","You bet. Hey, Doug, this is Gary. What we have seen is we have certainly seen some impact to the OPEC cuts. Our crude allocations have been cut a little bit primarily from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. But we have seen minimal impact to our system from the cuts. We continue to see good availability of grades from Latin America, Canada and U.S. sources to replace the volumes that have been lost from OPEC. Thus far, the impact from the cuts has really been offset by lower refinery demand due to refinery turnarounds. So it will probably be April, May before the full impact if any cuts are seen. Directionally, we really didn\u2019t see the meetings to how our discounts react at all to the OPEC cuts. When the cuts were announced, you saw an increase in flat price but the discounts really didn\u2019t change. Here over the last week, the medium sour discounts have come in a little bit, but we have actually seen heavy sour discounts move wider. PMI adjusted their K factor to make [indiscernible] a little more \u2013 the discount a little wider, and I think they had to do that to compete with the Canadians. So we have seen heavy discounts actually move wider. We always look at 3% fuel oil as kind of a leading indicator of where the discounts are going. And 3% fuel oil has actually moved from 85% of Brent last week to 82% of Brent. You see fuel inventories at Singapore that are above the 5-year high. The ARB to ship fuel to Singapore is closed, so that would kind of indicate that the discounts will actually move wider.","Doug Leggate","Okay. Just on the Keystone issue, I guess, I don\u2019t want to push the point too much, because I realized how much uncertainty there is, but I seem to recall in the past that you guys had \u2013 maybe I have got this wrong with talking about becoming an anchor shipper with an option to even acquire interest on that. Have I got that wrong or is that back in the table?","Gary Simmons","Well, so we are a shipper. We are still a strong supporter of Keystone. We don\u2019t have the ability to actually be an owner in the line. So, we are working with TransCanada as they try to better understand the executive order and drum up customer support. Our belief is that the direct connection from the Western Canadian production to the U.S. Gulf Coast is a good thing, because we have the most efficient capacity to really process those growing areas of production. Our intent, again, will be to process those barrels in our system, not to export the barrels.","Doug Leggate","Okay, I appreciate that. If I could just squeeze in a last one because that was kind of a follow-up, I guess, but Joe, you have put it down in \u2013 but I realized you addressed there earlier, but I just want to ask you a question about that very quickly, it\u2019s become the MO, I guess of your tenure as CEO, the return to shareholders, what are you thinking now in terms of the dividend yield, because you are not sitting, if not the highest, pretty close to the highest yield in the sector, is that kind of \u2013 do you have a target in mind, do you have an idea of how that dividend growth can evolve relative to buybacks, just what are you thinking in terms of the overall balance of one versus the other, I leave it there? Thanks.","Joe Gorder","Thanks Doug. The yield obviously is a function of the stock price. And we can\u2019t control the stock price. What we can control is how we reward the shareholders of the company and how confident we feel about our ability to produce cash flows, free cash flows within the company, that we try to manage, right and we do it through a capital allocation framework that Mike mentioned earlier. The dividend and our maintenance CapEx is non-discretionary in our minds and it will continue to be. So making commitments to our shareholder returns through the dividend is something that we don\u2019t take lightly and we modeled extensively. The buybacks and the growth projects, organic capital projects and acquisitions are areas that we consider to be competing for the use of free cash flow. And we look at the timing on our project development activities. We look at the return on our projects that Lane and his team are developing and that Rich and Martin have and we compared it to the value of buying back shares. And so we make the decisions accordingly to provide the highest returns for the shareholder. I would tell you, I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I would be lying to you if I told you that we look at the absolute yield and say that is what determines our decision around the dividend policy. It\u2019s more how do we feel about the cash flows that we can produce within the system.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the answer Joe. And I guess we will see you in a couple of weeks. Thanks.","Joe Gorder","Doug thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.","Johannes Van Der Tuin","Hi. Thanks for taking the call. It\u2019s Johannes here. I have to pinch hit today unfortunately for you all, but fortunate for me. Thank you for taking the call.","Joe Gorder","Glad to hear.","Johannes Van Der Tuin","The first question, I guess has to do with the other big policy that\u2019s not border adjustment taxes, but it\u2019s being pushed aside for the moment, but still probably later important to you and that\u2019s RINs, you mentioned it earlier up in the call, and what\u2019s your progress are you seeing in terms of trying to move the point of obligation or engaging with the EPA as there has been a transition, I know that Scott Pruitt is not in his seat yet, but nonetheless, if you have got any sort of color on that. And then would you expect the RIN market to move before any sort of policy change once there is some sort of color clarity on which direction it\u2019s going or are you modeling out for 2017 with the higher RIN expense because you don\u2019t think the market is going to move?","Joe Gorder","Okay, fair enough. Jason, you want to take the crack in our RIN?","Jason Fraser","Sure. Yes. To talk about the point of obligation effort meant maybe somebody else can speak to the RIN price. The comment on our petition to change the point of obligation is February 22, so that period is still open and there is till comments being generated. We firmly believe that once all the evidence is reviewed, the EPA is going to agree to the change the point of obligation. Regarding the introduction of the process, the Attorney General Pruitt as EPA Administrator, which has been there is some discussion about that is whether that will change the dynamic. In his confirmation hearing, he said he would administer the RFS in accordance with Congress\u2019 statutory objectives and he would make a decision based on the evidence and their administrative record. And it all sounds great to us, that\u2019s all we would ever ask for. So we think that after hearing all the arguments and reviewing the facts and what\u2019s in the record and consulting with the staff that they are going to agree that it should be moved. So we don\u2019t really see anything changed due to this changeover of administrators.","Johannes Van Der Tuin","And then on the actual RIN price and the trading price?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So again, our view is certainly you would see a reaction in the market if this gets done. And you would see RINs come off, we have seen some market reaction already. It\u2019s difficult for us to model because of all the uncertainty around it, so.","Joe Gorder","But yes, I guess Gary, we started the year like $0.95 per RIN and now it\u2019s like at $0.50.","Gary Simmons","Right.","Joe Gorder","So we have made the point all along that this is a market that we believe is right for manipulation and the fact that you have had this movement in it, it sure is based on fundamentals.","Johannes Van Der Tuin","It sounds good. So hopefully, there will be some movement. The other question I have I guess just had to do with the California margin weakness, clearly, the margin environment in California has come off quite a bit over the last six months, do you see an underlying reason for that, what the big driver is, is there a difference in the way the market clearing, is it just the Torrance has come back online, is there some sort of dynamic whether it would be weather or something else in terms of EMT that you would like to say, king of just curious as to what\u2019s going on out there for you rise on an operational basis?","Joe Gorder","Well, I certainly think Torrance coming back online has impacted the market here in the prompt market. As I mentioned, we saw some weaker demand with RIN on the West Coast. But overall, LA is moving to summer grade expect today, which you pull butane out of the pool, which directionally tightens it [ph], next month, the bay will go to summer grade gasoline. So all of those things should directionally help demand and bring supply and demand back into balance.","Johannes Van Der Tuin","Okay. So you don\u2019t see any sort of a grinding issue there?","Gary Simmons","No.","Johannes Van Der Tuin","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much for taking the call.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays.","Paul Cheng","Hi guys, good morning.","Joe Gorder","Good Paul.","Paul Cheng","I have to apologize first. I joined late, so my question, you already addressed, just let me know, I will take it offline. Two questions, if I may. First, if I am looking at the Contango curve, their current structure seems to suggest that you want to build inventory because that May and June, the margin was very high for gasoline, on the other hand, the stock is high right now, so just curious that internally for Valero, how you guys contemplate on those diverging forces and when you plan one, how you go with the process?","Gary Simmons","Yes. Paul for us, most of our tankage is more operational in nature, so we don\u2019t do a lot of storage plays to take advantage of the market structure. We do some of it especially on the crude side, but it\u2019s more related to buying opportunistic barrels that we believe have wide discounts and then you can also take advantage of the markets structure. But overall, we don\u2019t do a lot of that.","Paul Cheng","But I mean with inventory, at that high today Gary, is that influencing your decision that you may want to slowdown your run, even if the physical asset availability is there or that you don\u2019t really do that just because you are off the game favorably, that if you slow other people it is going to take up the slack anyway, so you are just going to max out your production even though you may build inventory yourself?","Gary Simmons","Yes. I think to me, the key on the inventory build is that what we are seeing out in the market is a lot of winter grade gasoline. And so our view is that those barrels are going to have to clear before we have our VP transition. And as those barrels clear, it will bring the market down and you will see economic run cuts and lower utilization while those barrels clear before we actually going to summer driving season.","Joe Gorder","Yes. But Gary, you are not suggesting that its Valero, it\u2019s going to make the run cut?","Gary Simmons","No, that\u2019s right.","Joe Gorder","I mean Paul, we are the lowest cash operating cost guys in the business and we don\u2019t have any strong interest in balancing the market ourselves.","Paul Cheng","Very good. If I may the second question is that, maybe this is either for Lane or for Gary also. I am looking at the margin capture RIN, system-wide in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s about 56%, 57%, which is 6% lower than the third quarter and 21% lower from the year ago level and if you are looking at your last 5- year average, it\u2019s about 65%, 66% and this year, it\u2019s about 60%, just curious that is that just a \u2013 because of the rising oil price or what \u2013 is there anything that you can see structurally, what then you will see in your system or that in the market new condition to make you believe that this year, the 60% margin capture weight is what the future may look like or that this is really more of an one-off certain items impacting that?","Gary Simmons","Yes. Paul, this is Gary. I will take it. Mike started the call with some comments that we took a LIFO charge in the fourth quarter of \u201816 and really, that LIFO charge explains the third quarter to fourth quarter variants that you talked about. It also explains a portion of the fourth quarter \u201815 versus fourth quarter \u201816 results. In addition to that, we had a couple other items. There is really nothing operational that I see, but the other big things that affect the year-over-year results. In \u201815, the blenders tax credit was enacted in December of \u201815 and so all of the credit was booked in the fourth quarter of \u201815, whereas in \u201816, that blenders tax credit was kind of spread out through the year so that had an impact on the capture rates. And the other big thing that we are looking at in terms of the capture rates is just the cost of the RINs. So in the fourth quarter of \u201815, RINs were around $0.49, whereas the fourth quarter of \u201816, they were $0.96. And so that delta in the cost of RINs also impacts our capture rates and that really is the bulk of it.","Paul Cheng","Gary, I mean, this certainly explains for the quarter. And for the year, RIN probably is part of the explanation. But for the full year of 60% capture rate also seems quite low comparing to the last several years what you have been able to achieve?","Gary Simmons","Yes, we can dive it into it more with John, I would suggest. But those are really the big items that we see. We don\u2019t really see anything operational, Paul.","Paul Cheng","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","Yes. Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Joe Gorder","Good morning, Roger.","Roger Read","I will leave some of the policy to decide for now, but I guess specific question for you. Exports have been a huge part on the product side, 2016 story looks like a good start to \u201817. Pemex is out saying they intend to run a lot better in \u201817 than \u201816. That\u2019s their forecast. I mean, we will see what turns out to be true, but could you characterize maybe the incremental growth in exports for you as to where that\u2019s gone and if Pemex were to run better in \u201817, is that a risk we need be concerned about or are there enough other growth areas internationally?","Gary Simmons","Yes, Roger. It\u2019s hard to tell. As Lane can tell you, it takes a long time to improve refinery mechanical availability, so we will see what happens there. But I think, one of the things that we are looking at and we export to Mexico and to South America and certainly when you look at a lot of the consultant views where Brazil has had negative demand growth over the last couple of years that are forecasting some decent demand growth in Brazil, so even if we are to lose some volume into Mexico, I think you could be absorbed in other locations in South America.","Roger Read","Okay. And then second question, M&A, I know with some of the policy uncertainty, maybe sellers don\u2019t want to sell and buyers want to be a little questionable. But I was wondering, Joe, as you kind of think about the longer plan here, Lyondell pulled their unit off the market, but maybe some of the other opportunities that exist there right now?","Joe Gorder","Mike, you want to speak to this?","Mike Ciskowski","Well, yes, Lyondell did pull their refinery back for now. Other than a few things on the West Coast, there are no opportunities really for the refining space presently.","Roger Read","Well, that was brief. And I heard that Lane was a miracle worker, so maybe we could get him to work for Pemex that will fix them?","Joe Gorder","No, we don\u2019t want to do that. But Roger, you are right, I mean, what Mike said is exactly right and it was characterized earlier. The Lyondell refinery is a nice opportunity, but they chose not to sell it. And we are just not seeing a lot of refining assets that are for sale that would add any value to Valero\u2019s portfolio. So from an acquisition perspective, what do you focus on? You focus on the opportunities in logistics and other areas where you could improve the earnings capability of the company by improving your logistics, your feeds in, your products out, and then potentially upgrading your stream. So we are not in a position \u2013 we don\u2019t believe we are in a position where we have got to go do a deal to balance on our portfolio. We will look at this a little differently and then we continue to seek ways to try to improve the quality of the portfolio we have got in place.","Roger Read","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Chi Chow with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Chi Chow","Thanks. Good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hi, Chi.","Chi Chow","Hi. Mike, do you have the cash balance held by the company\u2019s international subsidiaries as of year end \u201816? We have noticed that balance has been steadily growing over the last couple of years. I was just wondering if you could also talk about whether, one, that cash is available for use for domestic CapEx and capital returns to shareholders. Two, what are their \u2013 are there any repatriation inefficiencies in the current tax structure? And then third, how do some of the tax policy changes proposed under the new administration impact repatriation of that cash going forward?","Mike Ciskowski","Okay. Roughly at the end of the year, we had about $2 billion of cash that was in the UK and in Canada. So presently \u2013 okay, our current structure that we have today would allow us to move most of the cash back to the U.S. without incurring a significant tax penalty. We haven\u2019t needed to do that presently given where our U.S. cash balance is as well.","Joe Gorder","That was an incredibly clever way to ask three questions.","Chi Chow","That\u2019s all related, right.","Joe Gorder","That was good.","Chi Chow","Well, do you feel the need, any urgency to get that cash back given the potential changes in the repatriation policies going forward here?","Joe Gorder","The need to get it back, I don\u2019t think we have a sense of need to get it back. Would it be nice to have access to it? And Jason and the team are looking at the repatriation implications of the border tax adjustment. You always want to have your cash totally accessible to you. So, it will be great to get it back. But I would tell you that this \u2013 let\u2019s just assume that we are able to bring it back and bring it back in good shape. The question is that what do you do with it? You reinvest it in the business? I don\u2019t see us changing our approach to capital if we had the cash back, okay. I mean, I don\u2019t think Lane is going to say gee whiz, now I can do a whole bunch more, because we are not holding back on things that we are doing today. So it will be wonderful to have access to it without paying any tax on it. That\u2019s not likely. But I don\u2019t think it changes anything we are doing, Chi.","Chi Chow","Great. I will leave it there. Thanks, Joe. Appreciate it.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with UBS Securities.","Spiro Dounis","Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for squeezing us in here. Just wanted to follow up on the RFS. Without getting into what does it look like and then when does it change, just thinking about, I mean, I guess, an environment where the point of obligation has actually moved away from the refiners, just curious in terms of the reaction or just change in behavior on your part, maybe the refining industry in general, what are some of the things you think happens, I guess, on day 1 without the point of obligation? I think one thing we think about maybe is that exports actually go down, because of course, that\u2019s a good way to avoid the RIN. Just curious if you are thinking about anything else in terms of changes in product mix?","Joe Gorder","Gary, you want to?","Gary Simmons","Yes, I don\u2019t know that to some degree, the export market has over time recognized the RIN, so I don\u2019t really know that it really changes the dynamics of the export markets that much if the point of obligation moves.","Joe Gorder","Yes, I mean we have all adjusted to this. Really, the frustrating thing from our perspective is the negative effect it has by shifting the value of doing business from us to the guidance capturing the RIN. And so obviously, it would be beneficial to Valero if the point of obligation moved, which would reduce our burden. And frankly, we believe it would take a lot of the speculation and the manipulation opportunities out of that RIN market and it should lower the price of RINs. Now, the RVOs will have a factor on that and so on. But from a refiner, from an independent refiner\u2019s perspective, it will be positive.","Spiro Dounis","Appreciate the color. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Dietert with Simmons.","Jeff Dietert","Good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert","I am sitting here in Houston looking out my back window and the fog has cleared in the Houston ship channel, so hopefully, that\u2019s good news.","Joe Gorder","It is good news. Yes, do you see our ships loading, Jeff?","Jeff Dietert","They are going out one right after another. I had a question on your pace of the MLP drops and there are a few things going on, one of your peers accelerating, there is also the potential for lower corporate and individual tax rates under the Trump administration, potential for higher interest rates, how do these things impact your thinking on MLP valuations and the attractiveness of dropdowns?","Joe Gorder","Rich, you want to?","Rich Lashway","Yes. I will take a crack at our peers accelerating. So we have been pretty consistent in the execution of our strategy from the IPO that we are going to take a very measured pace. We believe that that\u2019s more of prudent to have a measured pace on our dropdowns. Valero\u2019s exceeded their targeted total payout ratio for the past 2 years. VLP doesn\u2019t really need to do any acquisitions or dropdowns to meet our distribution growth. There is not a need for the cash as we have kind of talked about, the cash balance at Valero. So we are just going to stick to our measured approach of growing, focusing on growing the distributions. We have been clear that we are growing distributions in \u201817 at 25% and at least 20% in \u201818. So it\u2019s really the focus is on the distribution growth at VLP. And we have got the coverage to achieve this and without doing anything drops.","Joe Gorder","And then Jeff, the tail on that was tax rate changes.","Mike Ciskowski","I mean the lower corporate tax rate, if that\u2019s what gets put in place, obviously would make the corporation a little more attractive. However, the MLP will still have the tax advantages structure versus the corporation.","Joe Gorder","In interest rates, I mean it just \u2013 it provides an investor different option, right. But you still have the benefits of everything that you have today with an MLP ownership position.","Jeff Dietert","Thanks for taking the questions.","Joe Gorder","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.","Ryan Todd","Hi. Thank you. You may have touched on parts of this over the course of the call and I apologize if I missed some of that. But can you talk through what you see as some of the similarities and differences as we look at the macro environment versus last year at this time margins are a little bit better, but we have seen some pretty significant inventory builds over the last four weeks again, I mean what are some of the lingering challenges that are maybe similar to last year and what\u2019s different this year that gives you confidence that we won\u2019t just repeat the 2016 environment again?","Gary Simmons","Yes. This is Gary. I think the similarities, we continue to see the industry running at high utilization rates and so the production of gasoline and distillate is exceeding demand in the marketplace, which isn\u2019t good, causing inventories to build. The difference we see is it looks like on the gasoline side a lot of what\u2019s being put into inventory is winter grade. So again, our view is this will have to clear before RVP transitions could bring inventories down before gasoline season starts, which would make this year look different than what we saw last year and should lead to better gasoline cracks. On the distillate side, not too much different I think the things that we are seeing on the distillate side is slightly better demand. So year-over-year, we will have a little colder weather here in the U.S. and also in Northwest Europe, which may distillate demand. And then as we see some resurgence in the upstream, the drilling activity, it also leads to a little better incremental diesel demand. So those are kind of the key factors we are looking at in the market.","Joe Gorder","And you are right, we don\u2019t know enough yet about the infrastructure projects that are being talked about, at the Federal level right now, what the implications of those are. But any time you get projects like this taking place, they tend to drive distillate demand, of course it would drive gasoline demands also. But \u2013 then there is the other things, petrochemical feeds, asphalt, things like that. So we are actually encouraged by the outlook and by the focus on the infrastructure within the U.S. So we will just see how it all plays out.","Ryan Todd","So I guess at a high level, it\u2019s safe to say you have just \u2013 is your view on \u201817, but it\u2019s still a little bit better that \u201816, but we will wait and see, is that...?","Gary Simmons","Yes. I think definitely, we will see the gasoline market being similar to \u201816, but a slightly better diesel market than \u201816.","Ryan Todd","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez","Gents, good morning. I am not sure I\u2019m as good as, but I am going to do my best at least two in for one here. The question is on pipelines, I know you talked about Keystone, but I am curious for one, do you have a sense of what the current transport cost is in the market and where that might go to once the pipe is in the ground. And then secondly on dapple, can you think of any direct maybe indirect positive impacts that you may have, whether it\u2019s just additional crude, light sweet on the Gulf Coast? Thanks.","Gary Simmons","Yes, that\u2019s some of the things that we are working with TransCanada on, so we don\u2019t really have guidance on where the Keystone itself tariff is going to be and that\u2019s certainly something that we are working with them on. In terms of dapple, yes I think you kind of hit on it, it\u2019s definitely will be bringing more light sweet to the Gulf Coast, which should be good for us.","Blake Fernandez","Good deal. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Faisel Khan","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Faisel. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just going back to Excel for a second and back to I think Doug\u2019s question, have you guys talked to them about taking an equity interest in the pipeline, I mean now that you have the sort of the MLP up and running, it might make sense for them to have an equity partner with their anchor shipper?","Joe Gorder","Faisel, you should never ask us that question when you got a guy who is responsible for the MLP in the room. But to answer your question, honestly, no, we haven\u2019t talked about an equity stake in Keystone.","Faisel Khan","Only because it might make sense for them to syndicate out some of that risk, given how large the pipeline is, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s?","Joe Gorder","That maybe true, but that does not mean that we would be the guy.","Faisel Khan","Along with the price.","Joe Gorder","That\u2019s right.","Faisel Khan","Okay. Thanks guys.","Joe Gorder","You bet.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Joe Gorder","Sure Craig.","Craig Shere","Quick follow-up on Phil and Doug\u2019s questions about capital deployment and buyback questions, it seems that the buybacks were kind of turbocharged little bit in \u201816 when shares were more in the mid-$50 area versus in the $60-plus area, as you think about flexing buyback metrics from earnings to cash flow in a low margin environment, how does the share price itself factor into your analysis?","Joe Gorder","Mike, you want to?","Mike Ciskowski","Well, I mean we don\u2019t have specific seasonal targets for our buybacks. It\u2019s on an annual basis, at least 75% of net income. And our program does consist of both somewhat ratable purchases, but also opportunistic purchases, too. So we just evaluate when we want to accelerate that depending on the stock price.","Craig Shere","Is it fair to say that the mid-$50 area is kind of turbocharged area for you?","Joe Gorder","We couldn\u2019t answer that question. But \u2013 and I think Mike answered it properly. It\u2019s \u2013 we sure don\u2019t want to signal our timing on our buying, but we look at what we view to be the earnings capability of this company. And if the returns on the buybacks are better than the returns on the growth CapEx project, then we are going to buyback shares. We said for years that we are not going to hoard cash, to the extent that we produce free cash flow. We will continue to look at the buybacks.","Craig Shere","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research.","Paul Sankey","Hi guys. Good morning. Forgive me if this has been asked\u2026.","Joe Gorder","Paul, where have you been?","Paul Sankey","On the Exxon \u2013 let\u2019s be honest, that it may be way \u2013 further to an earlier comment about the Houston ship and all the good news for you from New York is that it\u2019s snowing very heavily here, so there should be a bit more gas flow demand, I guess. Guys, I am sorry if you asked this \u2013 answered this already, but what\u2019s the latency on the border adjusted tax and what are you doing, I guess you have to some level plan for the potential for that to happen, what would you do if it did occur, so I guess the question is what\u2019s your understanding of the likelihood of that happens and what would be your response to if it did? Thanks.","Joe Gorder","Okay. Jason did talk to that earlier. Just want to give him the likelihood and then we can talk, Gary or we can talk about the other components of that question.","Jason Fraser","Yes. We really at this stage, we haven\u2019t put a handicap on the likelihood yet. It\u2019s so early, we don\u2019t even have any draft on legislative tax floating around the committee, so we don\u2019t feel it\u2019s proper for us to try to guesstimate that now.","Joe Gorder","And then Gary as far as well \u2013 Paul, it comes down to how are the markets going to react to this, right. And we have read all of the reports and we have read the consultants reports. Something is going to be good for refining, something that may not be as good for refining. And we talked earlier about the fact that we can adjust for the crude slate. But Gary, the markets are going to react.","Gary Simmons","Yes. So everything we have been doing is to increase de-stock flexibility and also be able to grow these export markets and both those things aligned well with this and we can optimize the system around border tax.","Paul Sankey","I guess the punch line kind of goes back to 2010 to \u201814 when we were trying to maximize usage of U.S. light sweets, where did you end up on all that, how much more could you use at the end of the process and do you have any numbers to illustrate the flexibility?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So if you look in our IR presentation, I think its Slide 9, it does a pretty good job of going through how we can swing our system between individual grades. We got to where we were processing over 1 million barrels a day of domestic light sweet crude, I guess that was pretty tougher, so we have added some additional capacity since that time as well so.","Joe Gorder","The interesting thing was, I guess at Port Arthur, you were able to increase overall run rates, throughput rates, because we were running the lighter slate. So Paul, we will be able to flex the system to deal with it. I guess the question is how to \u2013 how do the global crude markets respond to the duty, do they price to continue to push their barrels into the market or do they find a different home. And I think Gary has made the comment in several of the meetings that we have had that the natural home for a lot of the heavy sour crudes tends to be in the U.S. Gulf Coast refining system. So I don\u2019t know if that changes in any material way.","Paul Sankey","Absolutely and I guess, the other question is we would assume the gasoline prices at the pump would go up pretty much by the amount of the tax in the short-term?","Joe Gorder","Look that is certainly what we have read also, okay. And I think your friends at Goldman did a report here recently that I have gotten to study, but I thought okay, maybe they moved up and then they move back down, something rise, the market suggest to it. So Paul, the interesting thing is because this is kind of a topic du jour, right. But none of us \u2013 they got the skeleton out there and the House seems very committed to this today. But they don\u2019t have the flesh on the bones. There is lots of conversations that are taking place around do you have carve-outs, don\u2019t you have carve-outs and so on. I think what I have encouraged our investor base to do is just let\u2019s be patient, not over-reactive and let\u2019s just see how it shakes out. We will adjust to maximize the value to the company, but I don\u2019t think anybody knows enough yet to really understand what the full implications are. And then when we have seen changes like this, the markets tend to respond. So here again, we don\u2019t have a great deal of concern and consternation around us right now. We are just trying to understand it better.","Paul Sankey","Yes. I totally understand. Thank you very much.","Joe Gorder","You bet.","Operator","And thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. John Locke for closing remarks.","John Locke","Okay. Well, thanks everybody. And we appreciate you joining us today. Please contact me after the call if you have any additional questions. Thanks.","Operator","And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for participating.

My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Ashley Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Smith, you may begin.","Ashley M. Smith","Thank you, John, and good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer; Joe Gorder, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Kim Bowers, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of our senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.","Before we get started, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael S. Ciskowski","Thanks, Ashley, and thank you for joining us today. As noted in the release, we reported a first quarter 2012 loss from continuing operations of $432 million or $0.78 per share, which includes a non-cash asset impairment loss of $605 million after taxes or $1.09 per share, mainly related to the Aruba Refinery. Additional information about this loss is disclosed in the earnings release financial tables under Note D.","Our first quarter 2012 operating loss was $244 million versus operating income of $244 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the items mentioned in our earnings release, first quarter 2012 operating income was $367 million versus operating income of $786 million in the first quarter of 2011. The decline in operating income was primarily due to lower throughput margins in Refining, lower growth margins in Ethanol and lower fuel margins in Retail. Our first quarter Refining throughput margin was $7.71 per barrel, which is a 22% decrease versus the first quarter of 2011 margin of $9.91 per barrel. The decrease in throughput margin was mainly due to lower discounts on crude oils and feedstocks and lower margins for other products such as petrochemical feedstocks and petroleum coke, despite the higher margins for gasoline and diesel. In the first quarter of 2012, Gulf Coast gasoline margins per barrel versus LLS increased 72% to $6.56 from $3.82 in the first quarter of '11. Gulf Coast ULSD margins per barrel versus LLS remained very good and increased slightly from 13.59 in the first quarter of '11 to 13.68 in the first quarter of \u201812. The Maya heavy sour crude oil discounts versus LLS decreased 37% from $15.68 per barrel in the first quarter of 2011 to $9.89 per barrel in the first quarter of 2012. Our first quarter 2012 refinery throughput volume averaged 2.6 million barrels per day. That was up 449,000 barrels per day from the first quarter of '11. The increase in throughput volumes was mainly due to the addition of capacity from the acquisition of the Pembroke and Meraux refineries. Refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter of 2012 were $4.15 per barrel, which was higher than our fourth quarter 2011 due to lower throughput volumes and higher maintenance expense, but it was lower than our guidance of $4.50 per barrel mainly due to higher throughput volumes and lower energy costs than we expected. ","Our Ethanol segment reported $9 million of operating income, which was down $35 million from the first quarter of 2011, mainly due to lower gross margins as ethanol prices were pressured by excess industry supply. Even with lower margins, the Ethanol segment operated well and achieved 2 quarterly records, the highest average production rate at 3.48 million gallons per day and the lowest cash operating expense per gallon at $0.28.","Our Retail segment reported first quarter 2012 operating income of $40 million, consisting of $11 million in the U.S. and $29 million in Canada, which was down from the first quarter of 2011, mainly due to lower fuel margins. In the first quarter, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $164 million, which was in line with guidance but above fourth quarter 2011, mainly due to legal settlements that favorably impacted the fourth quarter of 2011 results. Depreciation and amortization expense was $384 million; net interest expense, $99 million; and the effective tax rate in the first quarter was a negative 28%, but adjusting for the Aruba impairment, the effective tax rate was 37%. ","Regarding cash flows in the first quarter, capital spending was $884 million, which includes $158 million of turnaround and catalyst expenditures. Our expected capital spending for the full year 2012 is consistent with our previous guidance at around $3.5 billion. ","Also in the first quarter, we returned $189 million in cash to our shareholders as we paid $83 million in dividends and spent $106 million to purchase 4.5 million shares of our common stock.","With respect to our balance sheet at the end of March, total debt was $7.6 billion, cash was $1.6 billion and our debt-to-cap ratio net of cash was 27.4%. At the end of the first quarter, we also had over $4.6 billion of additional liquidity available.","We made several notable improvements to our refining system in the first quarter. We started our hydrogen plants at Memphis and McKee, which benefit from high oil and low natural gas prices and were 2 of our key economic projects. In addition, we completed large turnarounds at our Wilmington and Memphis refineries, and we began a very large turnaround at our St. Charles refinery, which we just completed last week. Included at St. Charles was a project that replaced coke drums to improve reliability.","Regarding key capital projects in progress, our 2 hydrocracker projects at Port Arthur and St. Charles remain on budget and on time for completion in the second half of this year. These projects were designed to capitalize on high crude oil and low natural gas prices, while producing diesel and gasoline to meet the growing global demand. We look forward to completing these projects and enjoying the expected benefits to cash flow.","So now I'll turn it over to Ashley to cover the earnings model assumptions.","Ashley M. Smith","Okay, thanks, Mike. For modeling our second quarter operation, you should expect the refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.44 million to 1.48 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 380,000 to 400,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 275,000 to 285,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day. Refining cash operating expenses in the second quarter are expected to be around $3.85 per barrel, which is lower than the first quarter due to higher plan throughput volumes and expected lower maintenance costs. ","Regarding our ethanol operations in the second quarter, we expect total throughput volumes of 3.5 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average approximately $0.32 per gallon, including $0.03 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization expense.","With respect to some of the other items for the second quarter, we expect G&A expense excluding depreciation to be around $170 million, and net interest expense should be around $70 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter should be around $385 million, with the reduction in Aruba depreciation and amortization expense mostly offset by additional expense from new equipment entering service. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter should be approximately 36%.","Okay, John, that concludes our opening remarks. We'll now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I got a couple of quick ones hopefully. My first one is really on the crude charge. We've obviously seen another, I guess, extended or relatively extended period of very attractive TI and, I guess, inland discounts relative to waterborne crude. I'm just curious about -- I imagine you\u2019re trying to optimize your runs and if you could just give us an idea just to how, if any, changes that you're making or have made in terms of trying to gain greater exposure to those spreads? And I've got a couple of quick follow-ups, please.","Joseph W. Gorder","Okay, Doug, this is Joe. Listen, obviously, we are. We're trying to run as much of the light-sweet domestic crudes that we can. If I look at our crude slate in general, from last quarter, we did run more light-sweet crude, and we also ran more medium-sour crude, and we basically backed out resid. So we continue to look for opportunities to optimize the overall slate. Now when we think in terms of what are we doing in the Gulf Coast here and what do we think the market's going to look like, I mean, the Brent to LLS spread -- or LLS to WTI spread could be anywhere from $5 to $25 over the next year. We just -- none of us really have any idea as to what that's going to be. We do believe, though, however, that longer-term, that's going to come in to $3 to $4. And I think this view would be supported by the fact that Seaway's pipeline tariff is in that range or slightly below that. Now we know that domestic production of light-sweet crude is continuing to grow and is going to continue to do so over the next several years, and a lot of these crudes are making their way to the Gulf Coast via the pipelines, whether it be Seaway or Longhorn reversal, the Seaway expansion, the Keystone southern leg and so on. So these crude prices, the discounts are going to continue to come in. And in this system, what we're doing is looking for every opportunity to run more light-sweet domestic crude. We currently run about 200 a day, and we think that we can take that up by perhaps another 200, based on some projects that we're looking at. So that's our plan, and that's what I got for you.","Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My follow-up is kind of related, actually, because you guys periodically have dabbled with hedging, and I'm just curious if you have that view of that spreads are potentially coming in over time. I'm just curious if you're tempted to try and walk in some of those spreads currently in order to make whatever adjustments you would plan to do near-term?","Joseph W. Gorder","Doug, I guess this isn't directly the answer to your question, but we have -- and I think everybody knows that we've shifted our hedging. The parity point of crude pricing has shifted away from the Mid-Continent to the U.S. Gulf Coast, and so we\u2019ve shifted our feedstock hedging from a WTI-related basis to a Brent-related basis. And the true WTI barrels that we run in McKee and Ardmore, we're hedging with WTI. Everything else has been shifted to a Brent basis. That had a negative impact on us in the first quarter. But as we head into the second quarter, we're getting it back, and with our long-term view that these spreads are going to come in, we believe that we're properly positioned. Plus just philosophically, it makes sense to use the paper, that the crude that you're running is pricing off of is the risk management tool. And so -- and then your question goes broader to our hedging program. I mean, we do -- or our trading program. We do things from time to time, Doug, but nothing material.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mike, can you give me a number of the balance sheet item in terms of working capital, long-term debt, market value of your inventory in excess of LIFO [ph]?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Okay. Paul, the total current assets are $15.8 billion. Total current liabilities, $13.1 billion. Our cash is $1.6 billion as I'd mentioned in my notes, and then our current maturities are $1.1 billion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The cash is already included in the $15.8 billion you gave, right?","Michael S. Ciskowski","That's correct. Okay, market value of our inventory is $14.2 billion, and value in excess of LIFO is $8.7 billion. Total debt, which includes...","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Long-term debt?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Yes. $7.6 billion, and stockholders equity, $16 billion.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","$16 billion, your stockholders equity, perfect. Bill, wondering, did we -- looking in Pembroke, did you make money in the first quarter?","William R. Klesse","What I'm going to do going forward here is because we don't break out these refineries, we deal by system, so we're not going to give you any, going forward, how we're doing on the particular plant. So this would be kind of the last time. So at Meraux, we've had a very tough start; however, we've had a turnaround, several turnarounds. We had high crude costs come through, and so now as we get started here into the second quarter, we think Meraux is going to fit very well. You ask about Pembroke. Pembroke has largely been breakeven at the refinery. Marketing has been a little better, but basically, I'd just say to you, it's been a breakeven. Where we're working there is on cost and structure. Their costs are much higher than the way Valero will run these businesses going forward. And just to give you an idea, in April, Pembroke is very profitable. But -- so basically, we haven't made any money on either of these plants or the acquisitions, but we still think they fit very nicely for us, and we've made a lot of changes in 6 months.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bill, in Pembroke, or that I mean, your overall experience in Europe, does it in any shape or form that have changed your view whether you want to further expand into the European market?","William R. Klesse","Well, it wouldn't be related to our experience at Pembroke. We look at assets that come on the market because we\u2019re very -- I guess I should add, we\u2019re very satisfied with the Chevron acquisition. We just had to make some changes in the way Valero does business. And we had Joe Gorder over there, and he's made a lot of changes, and now, we're sending Eric Fisher over to run the business, and we'll be implementing these changes over the next year. So our experience and how it fits into our system, overall, and for the long term, we\u2019re very satisfied. Now you ask about expansion in Europe, well, we\u2019re very concerned about the financial crisis in the sense that's going on in Europe. We're concerned about, frankly, the very, very large refining overhang in Europe. And so, as we see these plants coming on the market, we're just going to be very, very cautious. It really has to fit into our system going forward.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bill, do you have the number you can share in terms of the same-store sales in the first quarter and also so far in April in your network?","William R. Klesse","Yes. So now we're to the U.S. Retail, we'll give you the Canada as well, and Gary Arthur is here who runs our Retail, so...","Gary Arthur","So, yes. The same-store gasoline was up 2.5% for the first quarter versus a year ago. We continue to benefit from the strength of the Texas market where we have about 600 of our 1,000 company-operated stores. So Texas continues to be very, very strong. We're a little bit weaker in the West, and I think that's a reflection of both the economic climate not being quite as strong and competitive pressures that we see in that market.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","How about in April so far?","Gary Arthur","April so far, we're about where we were in March, about even with March, and on a same-store basis on gasoline, we're down about 7\/10 of 1%. When you adjust for the fact that we have 5 Sundays in the month of April this year versus last year, Sundays being our slowest day of sales, so when we adjust for that, to get a true comparison, we're down slightly.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then when you say in the first quarter up 2.5% in benefit, correct me, from the Texas strong market. If we would strip out Texas, then what does your overall same-store sales look like?","Gary Arthur","If we stripped out Texas, I would tell you, we would be down slightly.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So less than 1%?","Gary Arthur","Yes, I would say less than 1%.","William R. Klesse","But that reflects California, Colorado\u2026","Gary Arthur","Arizona.","William R. Klesse","And Arizona, which\u2026","Gary Arthur","Wyoming. Those 4 markets.","William R. Klesse","But Arizona is down significantly, and so has been Colorado, right?","Gary Arthur","That's right.","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bill, final question. It looked like that in many of the shale oil plays, the liquid production coming out of your NGL and condensate, and black oil may be actually less than 50%?","William R. Klesse","Paul, I missed a couple of words. Oh, shale\u2026","Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'm saying that in many of the new shale oil plays, whether it's in Eagle Ford or even in the Permian Basin and all that, the new liquid production increase looks like it's going to be NGL and condensate, and maybe less than half is black oil. So do you see that as an opportunity for you to bring more of the condensate in your system or that you build some condensate splitters to take advantage of, potentially, an oversupply of condensate?","William R. Klesse","So you have a lot of questions there. In the Eagle Ford, the quality of the oil has actually been better than what was originally expected, that being it's a little heavier. So it's better quality oil. So we are running -- Joe told you, but we're running 100,000 barrels a day, and another month or 2, we\u2019ll be even higher between Three Rivers, Corpus Christi and Houston. We are actually taking some to Houston. So that's been the higher quality. Some of the other basins, we're not really connected to, so it's been kind of an academic question so far. And obviously, the stuff in the Panhandle, Ardmore, has all been good quality oil. So now to condensate, yes, we would agree with all the chemical companies, from NGLs to condensates, that we see this -- and how you divide them sometimes gets a little hazy there. But we see a significant increase in ethanes, propanes, butanes, all these, geez even the C6's. So, yes, we see that coming to market. That's why I think somebody told me the other day, there is 9 ethylene plants announced, and this is the resurgence of the petrochemical industry in the United States. And we at Valero are looking for ways that we can participate where we bring real value to the conversation. So we continue to look at our options. But yes, your general statement is absolutely true. There is a significant increase in NGLs and condensates.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It\u2019s Faisel from Citi. On the Memphis refinery, I know you guys have access to the Capline pipeline system. What's your ability as a major customer on that pipeline to influence its reversal?","William R. Klesse","We would probably have no influence at all. We're not an owner. It's Plains and Marathon and BP. Is that right?","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes.","William R. Klesse","Plains, Marathon, BP. And they're the owners of the pipeline, and they own the pipeline.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Understood. Can you give us an idea how your Eagle Ford crude is pricing into your refinery systems today?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Yes. It\u2019s pricing off of LLS minus the discount.","William R. Klesse","And we have a posting, and it's posted there, which you could look up, but I think it's LLS minus $6.  But it's a posting, so it's readily available to anybody.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the hydrocracker integrations at Port Arthur and St. Charles. And what's required with those plants, how does that impact the operations, the facility as you tie those hydrocrackers in?","William R. Klesse","So Lane Riggs that runs Refining is with us, and Lane is going to answer you.","Lane Riggs","So in terms of -- we anticipate starting up Port Arthur as mentioned earlier, in the second half, and then we'll finish mechanical completion on St. Charles right at year-end. We have start-up teams on the ground already, working to get these things started up over the licensors and our own internal refinery experts, and we have a pretty good strategy in terms of trying to acquire feed -- getting the feedstock for them, and so we're working through all that.","Joseph W. Gorder","And then I guess on the product side, we've got, Jeff, we\u2019ve got this stuff in place to move the barrels out. I mean, we're -- at Port Arthur, we\u2019re looking forward to having the high-quality, high-cetane diesels that we've put out in the market and export. And then at St. Charles, we\u2019ve got the export capabilities, plus we're doing Parkway Pipeline project, which will allow us to move barrels out of that market up to Collins and then into Plantation or Colonial.","William R. Klesse","So Jeff let me go back and add a little more to Lane. So -- but the process we're checking, so it's mechanically complete, and then we have to check out these -- check it out here, and that's going to take us 3, 4 weeks. Then we have to do some pre-treating. Then you have to load the catalysts. So when you actually look at this thing, even though we've been training our people here for a year, actually, from mechanical completion to the point of starting up here is really going to take us between 60 and 90 days. So that if you actually look at this, where I've told some of you guys we could get this done in 6 weeks to 8 weeks, it's really going to take us a little longer than that because of some of the catalysts. Remember, these are high-pressure units running at 2,200 pounds. So we really won't see the benefit of the unit at Port Arthur until the fourth quarter in the P&L, and the same would be true at St. Charles. It'll probably spill to very late in the first quarter or actually see the full benefit in the second quarter.","Jeffrey A. Dietert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division","Gotcha. Very helpful. And does the integration impact the throughput into the crude unit?","Lane Riggs","Jeff, this is Lane again. No, we did all the tie-ins and all that tie-in work on previous turnarounds, so we don't anticipate a throughput on the rest of the refinery to start these up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","I hopped on a tad late, so I apologize if you covered this, but I had a question regarding the opportunity cost of the downtime in the first quarter. Obviously, a very heavy turnaround period, and that weighs on your efficiency and capture rates. I'm curious if you can give us an idea of what your kind of normalized earnings may have looked like had you not had that downtime.","Ashley M. Smith","Blake, our estimate for first quarter impact was about $170 million.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","$170 million. And that's pre- or post-tax, Ashley?","Ashley M. Smith","That's pretax.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, I get somewhat related to that, obviously, as we move to kind of a more normalized run rate and, hopefully, cash flow improves, the buyback run rate in the first quarter is about $100 million. Should we think that, that run rate kind of improves heading into 2Q with, hopefully, improved cash flow?","William R. Klesse","I would not make that assumption. It is tied to the free cash flow. I have said that we will look at our dividend again in July as we completed the Port Arthur hydrocracker. We also have $750 million of debt that matures here in April.","Ashley M. Smith","We've already paid.","William R. Klesse","We already paid. We also actually called $107 million of tax exempt debt that was economic to call, and that gets paid, right here, first of May.","Ashley M. Smith","Right, it's later this week.","William R. Klesse","Later this week. So we are also working the interest rate arbitrage that you have on our debt. So there's things that we're doing with our cash. But our intent, Blake, is to return cash to the shareholders as we\u2019ve said and have one of the highest yields among our peer group, and we continue to do that, and we think our equity is still very inexpensive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rakesh Advani from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I know you guys had highlighted that you're seeing a pretty strong export environment. I just kind of wanted your views on how long do you think that would -- is going to last for and what the impact of Motiva will be on it.","Joseph W. Gorder","Well, I'll tell you, you said it, and it's true. I mean, the export markets are very strong right now. I mean, diesel growth and demand abroad is very high. We\u2019re seeing diesel exports, not perhaps at the highest levels they've ever been, but certainly, very near that. And for the quarter, we exported 170,000 barrels a day of diesel. The bulk of that went to Europe. The rest of it went to Latin America. On the gasoline side, we're also seeing strong demand there. And again, gasoline exports are at very high levels historically. And for the quarter, we exported 80,000 barrels a day of gasoline, most of which went to Mexico and Latin America. If you look at the factors that are affecting the export market going forward, I mean, they're not factors that can readily change. I mean, Chile is importing as much, if not more, distillates as they ever have, and their demand continues to grow. So far this year, they're importing 83,000 barrels a day. Mexico's diesel imports were 105,000 barrels a day, and their Refining capacity just doesn't meet their internal demand for products. If you look at what's happening on the gasoline side, you've got Venezuela with capacity off-line. We've got Hovensa shut down, so that production is out of the market, Mexico gasoline imports have averaged 392,000 barrels per day. That's up 5% over the previous year, and Petrobras is importing significant volumes of gasoline and diesel. So all of these are based on solid economic activity and lack of supply. And so these aren't things that readily get addressed. Now how will Motiva affect this? Well, obviously, anytime you're going to put more product into the market, you're going to offset other product unless there's growth in the market. And so, who would be at risk in this case? It would be the marginal caps [ph]. It would be the marginal refiners, and that's not us.","William R. Klesse","I think I would add to this that Joe mentioned Hovensa is down. We've shut Aruba down. Aruba made distillate. It did not make gasoline. Marcus Hook is down. Trainer is down, but I guess it's coming back. So if you look at just the basics in the U.S. supply, even though some is East Coast, some is Gulf Coast, really Motiva is just kind of filling in a void that these refineries have left. So I think, initially, there'll be some logistics as people try to jockey things around. Some will go in the pipelines because Colonial has done an expansion. Plantation has some room. And some will get exported, but on the other hand, there's been refineries taken off-line, and just remember that Cura\u00e7ao is limping along. And obviously, the Venezuelans are really no longer in the export market.","Rakesh Advani - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just one final one. I know on your slides that you put on your presentation you've talked about the Brent to LLS inversion. You've kind of given the range, I guess, maybe between 2014 and '15 where you could see an inversion based on 2011 imports of light to medium sweet crude. I guess the recent data from the EIA is showing that imports of that kind of crude is only averaging about 510,000 a day. Do you think this would kind of alter your view on maybe it happening even sooner than expected?","William R. Klesse","Well, I think it's a very fair question. Remember on our slide, there is a little bit of a dilemma of where you make the cut between some of the lights and the mediums. So if you're looking at our slide, let's just stick with our numbers and -- because we probably have some medium crude in there. But basically, the U.S. is going to push out of the Gulf Coast the light-sweet crude. Now it is happening quickly. Eagle Ford production is increasing dramatically, and that is getting to the Coast. Some of the other crudes, Enterprise says they're going to start up -- Enterprise, Enbridge will start up Seaway here in May, right? In May, don't forget you have Magellan on Longhorn, so you have all these things that are going to happen in the next year. So all that crude is coming. The big piece of that, though, I will remind you and our assumptions is that BP at Whiting where BP\u2019s heavy-up [ph] project, and so that's a big, sort of like 200,000 barrels a day of the volume that basically gets pushed back into Cushing. So we still think it's a '14, '15, but your question is correct. It makes a little difference where you're cutting the lights and the mediums.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Dahlman Rose.","Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","You mentioned Seaway. I was curious if you have any guidance for Seaway barrels that you might be buying for 2Q or later than that? I guess it\u2019s starting up, as you mentioned, within the next couple of weeks here.","William R. Klesse","Well, we're not a shipper on Seaway. It will just be availability of barrels on the Gulf Coast.","Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And for those, that would be, they'd already be repriced at LLS once they get there?","William R. Klesse","Well, I guess. It just depends on how many of them there are.","Sam Margolin - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Lastly, this is more of a macro question. There's been a lot of sort of outside-of-industry interest in refining assets. Presumably, it's just a reaction to simple coastal cracks expanding. It seems like the benefits of this capacity rationalization that we saw lead to events that sort of offset those benefits down the road when you get restarts. Are you concerned about the levels of light-sweet cracks here on the coast as we get restarts and sort of private equity or outside buyers chasing the market?","William R. Klesse","Well, we believe there's still too much refining capacity in the U.S., as well as certainly, Western Europe. So the Atlantic Basin has too much refining capacity. So how does the industry balance it? It balances by reducing operating rate. And so, as these plants, certainly as Trainer appears that it's going to come back into the market, it's going to put some refined product back in there, and that will affect the operating rates. But the industry is slowly rationalizing capacity. It just does. Some things die hard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI Group.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can we just summarize your comments on U.S. gasoline and diesel demand to say that it appears from your -- and I know this isn\u2019t perfect -- functional and geographical perspective that we may be gravitating towards maybe minus 1% to 0% growth year-to-date? Is that kind of consistent with what you were saying earlier?","William R. Klesse","Well, certainly, it's down. Gene is going to give you his comments.","S. Eugene Edwards","This is Gene. If you look at the monthly data or the weekly data that\u2019s come out, it looks like gasoline demand has been off about 4% year to date. But something interesting, the DOE just published the February monthlies, which is all the revised data. And I think they we're missing exports last year on gasoline. They were understating them. This year, they've been overstating them. Also some discrepancies on naphtha, whether it's a blend stock or a chemical feedstock and how that gets categorized. So when they published the February data, they actually revised gasoline demand up by 300,000 barrels a day, which put it basically flat to last year. So this was February. In January, we had a similar thing going on. We won't really have the March data until a month from now, but it looks like gasoline demand is a lot flatter than last year than what the all the other data has been showing so far. [indiscernible] distillate, it got revised up. The month -- the weekly data showed it's about flat to last year. The monthly data says it's up about 2% versus last year.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Gene, that's consistent with what you guys are seeing in your markets?","S. Eugene Edwards","Exactly.","Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And also Bill, you mentioned a minute ago about the resurgence in the petrochemical industry, something along those lines, and so you mentioned you might be interested in participating in the value chain. And so to the degree you're interested, could you comment on what you mean by that? And does that include grassroots petrochemicals?","William R. Klesse","Well, I don't know if it includes grassroots in the sense of businesses where we don't participate. I mean, you need to bring some value to this conversation. But we make benzene, toluene, xylene and we make a lot of propylene today. I'm sure we do something else. Is there anything else we make? But we're big in propylene here. So we've looked at mixed xylenes. Obviously, these condensates, actually I think, will replace some oil long-term into gasoline. So there's a lot of that type of thing, and we're looking at how do we take advantage of this because if you think strategically about Valero, we largely make fuel, and 80% of our output is fuel, and it doesn't necessarily all have to come from oil.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up to an earlier comment that you are running about 200,000 a day of I think it was WTI-linked is perhaps how you described it, and you had several projects underway to double that. Firstly, what's the timeframe on those projects? And I guess the big question here is how much more light-sweet U.S. crude you believe you can run on a longer-term basis and how much that would cost?","William R. Klesse","Well, let me answer you then, and Joe can add to this. What -- at Three Rivers, Corpus Christi, we\u2019re approaching about all we can run without getting some -- without a permit option and a project. And that number is going to be a hundred and do you guys have [indiscernible] Ashley?","Ashley M. Smith","About 140,000, yes. 130,000.","William R. Klesse","Including Houston or no?","Joseph W. Gorder","No. That would not\u2026","William R. Klesse","110,000 at Corpus and at Three Rivers, and then we're doing 30,000 or so at Houston. Then we have numerous pre flash options and things that allow us 30,000 here, 40,000 there, at some of our other plants, which we can do because it loads up our light engine. Beyond that, we are still basically a heavy complex coking refiner. And we still believe, strategically, that the Keystone Pipeline is going to be built. It's going to be built on Obama's time scale, which is first quarter of '13. We think that there will be approval if he wins election and that the pipeline will get done here by the end of '14 or early '15 and that heavy crude oil will come to the U.S. Gulf Coast. So -- but Valero still brings value in being able to operate these coking-type refineries. And it'll all be driven economically with our LPs, which will squeeze in as much of the light crude if it's priced properly.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Bill, that list got me 200,000 of existing. Where's the extra 200,000 coming from?","Joseph W. Gorder","If we take a look at what we can do, you can swing Houston to run 100% light-sweet. Now this is all assuming that the economics makes sense for us to do this. You can run more light-sweet crude in Texas City, and we could run light-sweet crude in Port Arthur.","William R. Klesse","Okay. So I'll give you some numbers because obviously we do all this work. We could run about 85,000 at Houston, 40,000 at Texas City, 40,000 at Port Arthur, 20,000 at St. Charles and 50,000 or so at Meraux and so, we can do those kind of things so...","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is that with no extra spending that you could get there?","William R. Klesse","There is some spending but minor, very minor.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then if there was -- sorry to just press the subject a bit, but it's very interesting and a very big story as far as we're concerned...","William R. Klesse","Well, it's because every company you will talk to is going to try to do what I'm speaking.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. And what do you think -- what would be the next leg if you wanted to -- let's say, for example, Keystone was not approved or it was uncertain for another 3 years, 4 years, whatever? Would you -- what would you do then?","William R. Klesse","Well, what we would be forced to do is look at being able to run more light-sweet -- light and medium crudes in some our refineries, because it would all be dependent on what the diff is for the heavy sour.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. What -- so to take the second part of that first, what is the discount? I mean, does -- I think there's an approximate number to think about for how much discount or premium of heavy oil, whatever it is that would cause you just to say, okay, all light-sweet from here?","William R. Klesse","Well, we think that between in a SUN coker, between 10% to 12% of the price, you can run a SUN coker and make money. And if you would drop down, if you get down to 8%, 7%, if you still have $100 oil here, you're running out of economics on the coker. You think so, Gene?","S. Eugene Edwards","Probably so. A lot of it depends on where the medium sours are too.  Today, medium sours are running between $5.50, $6 discounts to LLS, so we are still seeing good margins to run the medium sours in those sort of refineries versus sweet. And then they'd look at the medium sours, it's going to be a switch between that and the heavy sours so that\u2019s about a $6 spread as well between those 2.","William R. Klesse","And so this is what Gene's getting into more detail is this is what happens every single day here. We have a whole department that runs these models for us, and it would just be -- if we don't have the discounts out there for heavy sour, we're optimizing the system all the time. Remember, we're buying our oil every day.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But what I'm wondering, Bill, is at what point would you actually start investing to up your light. I mean, obviously, I guess you wouldn't do that until you were sure Keystone was not going to happen.","William R. Klesse","Well, we would -- we might do some pre flashing. But the issue you went into, quite frankly, is you load up your gas plant and your light end capability. And so those projects certainly become bigger. And then we have to be honest. In the world where we live in today, it is extremely difficult to get these permits as long as we have to do CO2. In Texas, it's terrible, and Kim's here, and she's telling that even in Louisiana and other states, it's extremely difficult now.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And that's because you get more CO2 with a light-sweet crude?","William R. Klesse","Well, because we may have more heaters, you got more process, so if we trip -- yes, go ahead, speak","Kimberly S. Bowers","Right, so if we trip them into the tailor [ph] and roll the CO2, now we have to cover CO2 in our permits, whether you're in Texas or any place else for -- if we hit that major level so...","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Is there any sense of what level is? Sorry to keep pressing on this, but it's kind of crucial.","Kimberly S. Bowers","No. I think it's 75,000 or 100,000. I mean, if the tailoring rolls, it's a threshold that's higher than it would normally be to trip it, but still, almost any significant project will trip it.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's really interesting...","William R. Klesse","But that now makes -- us and everybody else has to get a permit that addresses the CO2.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But I think, as just a final point, you don't expect the crude export ban to be lifted, right?","William R. Klesse","We do not.","Paul Sankey - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is there a specific reason for that, Bill, or is it a general kind of opposition to raise -- what would effectively raise crude price in the U.S, I guess?","William R. Klesse","It's just we just have felt that, that's going to be very difficult to have happen. But I wouldn't say we're giving you a scientific or any better answer here than you would have yourself.","Operator","Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just maybe some follow-up on this broader Gulf Coast impact from U.S. production growth. I mean, just beyond maxing out light runs in your system, which clearly isn\u2019t optimal -- at current differentials isn\u2019t optimal for many of your refineries you just detailed. But before any major Canadian solution is available, as a next step, I mean, can you talk through the -- an increased kind of blending opportunity here with the overload of lights to kind of blend into some of these medium crudes to press those discounts or re-create those. Is that -- I mean do you -- how do you see blending playing out when you have, essentially, a system in the Gulf of Mexico and you could debate the time based upon what you think production growth date is, where you're going to back out at least one type of crude at some point that you can debate the timeframe. But over the next couple of years, how does blending kind of play into that?","William R. Klesse","Well, it's a very good question. Now we aren't blending or anything at a terminal, so this is all at refineries. Now we are, at St. Charles and at Corpus Christi, putting in facilities that will let us run a broader selection of crudes, and then we will blend them for the process unit, because we'd like to show the process unit a relatively steady diet here of crude. So we actually have -- 2 of our plants have projects underway right now. One is tankage. One is a lot of pipe, to allow us to blend crudes for the unit, which would let us run a broader spectrum of crude. And we're looking at the same type of projects for the other plants as well. So we're doing it at the refineries, and it lets us then optimize that crude cost.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Does the blending raise the potential ceiling of a light-sweet diet that's ultimately kind of blended into something else before it's run versus what you stated?","William R. Klesse","Yes. We would optimize -- this is a little bit of -- you're asking something here, so we're going to give you -- this is how we view it, all right?","Lane Riggs","This is Lane Riggs. So the numbers you heard from Bill earlier in terms of the amount of light sweet crudes into each one of the refineries is pretty much the number on a blended basis into these refineries up to sort of a light ends constraint or a crude tower shell capacity constraint making -- backing out medium sour or light-sweet in that refinery.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So there\u2019s not an incremental back-out of any kind of medium barrel -- if the price allowed it without a front-end investment?","Lane Riggs","We would. We look at the relative value of these domestic sweets or any sweets for that matter versus the medium sour, and we increment up to a constraint on the refinery, and that's so -- the numbers that Bill had given you earlier is roughly our constraint to a light end constraint or a shell capacity. Probably backing out depending on the refinery whether it could be medium sour or sweet.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Understood. A different question on Keystone South. I didn't know if you've had this in your comments, but then would you have to nominate in that line to maintain a position in the Keystone XL, the transnational line?","Joseph W. Gorder","No. They're reserving the space in the South segment for those that nominated space on the -- as part of the bullet line.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. But if you ultimately wanted -- if you didn't take Keystone South capacity, would that negatively impact your ability for your nominations when the line is ultimately...","Joseph W. Gorder","From Hardisty. No, it would not affect our commitments from Hardisty South. We have our space. The committed shippers on the northern segment will have their space all the way down. Now when I ship from Cushing South, then we need to nominate incremental space. In other words, we've got our space all the way from Hardisty to the Gulf. But if we just say we want to move Mid-Continent barrels from Cushing South in addition, we would need to nominate.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. And then maybe lastly, do you have any closure cost estimate on the Aruba Refinery, what that...","William R. Klesse","As of today, we've just suspended operations. So we are working all our options and still continue to work our options. And so, it's a different situation than some of the other numbers that you've seen in the marketplace. But ours would be less than $100 million, but the facts are that's not what -- we're working really some options here that will be good for our shareholders.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Wow. Maybe you could sell to Delta.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry to go back to this, but just so I'm understanding the light sweet ability in the Gulf Coast, you can do 200,000 today. To do another 200,000 requires some modest amount of investment and then to go beyond that, you have the issues with the permits and more meaningful CapEx? Am I understanding that correctly?","William R. Klesse","That's correct.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Any quantification on how much minimal investment is and the timeframe to do it?","Lane Riggs","Not much. Like Bill said, we would -- to do more than we have the capacity today, we'll have to put some pre flash towers in some of our heavy sour locations because the shell capacity of those towers really were designed to run a heavier diet. So it'd be tough...","William R. Klesse","No, I don't think we have a good number for you.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then separately, you talked about ongoing portfolio optimization. You've obviously taken the action at Aruba and the East Coast plants. Where does the California fit in terms of how you see it as part of your system? Clearly -- or presumably not as bleak of an outlook as the East Coast. Do you see any light at the end of the tunnel there or any other actions you can take to improve your California outlook?","William R. Klesse","Well, Arjun, we are taking action. Our costs at Benicia are too high, and we've been addressing that to get our per barrel cost down and we continue to work that. But the California market is a big market, and we still have 11% unemployment in California, so they have many, many economic issues in the state. The thing that is struggling to us is that their policies, primarily from CARB, are extremely anti-business, and the consumer really does not understand how much his prices are going to go up, which is what CARB wants so that they get the conservation. So you asked a proper question. We\u2019re trying to optimize our portfolio so that we can compete long-term, and we're trying to evaluate all of these issues and what our real potential is on the West Coast.","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Would separating it from Valero make sense? And is that a consideration for you?","William R. Klesse","I hadn't thought of -- you mean like separate it into a freestanding business?","Arjun N. Murti - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, Valero California, whatever you want to call it. Separate company, spun out from Valero Corp.","William R. Klesse","We have not looked at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chi Chow from Macquarie Capital.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Sorry to circle back on the light sweet issue one more time. So if you put in these flash towers with minimal CapEx, does that change your crude flexibility at all going forward? In other words, can you swing back to the heavier barrel, if need be, if prices are correct?","William R. Klesse","Yes, we can. You guys are asking us things that we have not engineered here. So we're off in a thing here -- the conversation is probably 4 years out. But yes, if we -- if that's what happens. But I want to emphasize what we do every day and, frankly, what all our competitors do every day is they're running their LPs, and they play -- they go to a crude mix that they believe is optimal for that facility. And what we're doing right now is we're building some tankage at St. Charles, we're doing work at Corpus Christi, that allows us to blend crudes, give us more flexibility here so that we can run and buy some other crudes that are priced economically.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","When they're available?","William R. Klesse","When they're available. But as this volume continues to increase, we, as everybody, will wind up being able to run more of this light and medium crude oils. Because we will do things around our plants to let us do it, because we do believe that LLS is going to sell at a discount to Brent, and that's the main point that will drive you that way.","Chi Chow - Macquarie Research","Right. Mike, a couple of quick items. What's the remaining CapEx on the hydrocrackers as of the end of the first quarter? And did I hear you right that the debt maturity in April, you paid that off?","Michael S. Ciskowski","Yes, we paid off the debt maturity, the $750 million. The remaining capital on the hydrocrackers, it's about -- Port Arthur, we look like we have about $300 million left and on St. Charles about $500 million left.","William R. Klesse","Just so you know, there's a couple other little projects around there that are finishing as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a follow-up. In our discussion around the incremental amount of light-sweet crude you could run in the Gulf Coast, where does Memphis fit into all this? I mean, clearly, I think that's consuming LLS benchmark crudes. So what kind of crude slate is that consuming? And how would that benefit from an LLS discount versus Brent?","William R. Klesse","Well, it will benefit in the sense that -- what product prices are. But your observation is correct. Memphis runs an LLS plus because Capline flows north. So this goes all the way back to a question earlier that someone asked about Capline going south. Also, some crudes can come into the refinery by water as well, but the plant runs LLS plus. It does have a very strong local market though. It has -- I guess it's -- the largest rack in our system are very close, and we have a big customer for turbine fuel, and so we operate in more of a regional capacity at the Memphis plant.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And on the hydrogen plant investments that came online I believe you said in the first quarter here, you gave us some guidance in your slide presentations of around $100 million in EBITDA was your base case, and I think using 2011 prices, you said about $176 million using LLS, but I assume that was based on last year's natural gas prices. So I was trying to figure out what the lower gas price for this year means in terms of potential uplift for that investment.","William R. Klesse","The guys are looking it up. Remember, at McKee, we had the catcracker down. We're still running some oil there, but we have a big turnaround going on. So the McKee hydrogen plant has not run to capacity yet. We\u2019ve got the numbers here.","Ashley M. Smith","Faisel, this is Ashley. For every dollar change in the price of natural gas per MMBtu, it adds about $6.5 million a year in EBITDA, and based on the '11 pricing, we're effectively using $4 natural gas. So you could easily -- on your call, whatever your call on natural gas is, it looks like at least $1 lower, could be more.","Operator","Our last question comes from Harry Mateer from Barclays.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A quick one from me. Mike, can you just confirm the April maturity? Did you pay that down with cash on hand? Or did you use the bank facility or the AR line?","Michael S. Ciskowski","We have dipped into our AR line a little bit while we paid off this maturity. But we started the quarter with $1.6 billion of cash.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So what -- it would help maybe you can -- what's the pro forma debt number, I guess, we should be using?","Michael S. Ciskowski","I guess...","William R. Klesse","We're probably going to go ahead and issue some tax exempt bonds that we have the ability to do. So if you want a good number, I'm going to say to you 7 1 or 7 2.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Ashley M. Smith","Okay, thank you, John.

(Operator Instructions). Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. John Locke. Mr. Locke, you may begin.","John Locke","Thank you, Daniel. Good morning and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our CEO and President; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also, attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","Now, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC.","Now, before we review the quarterly results, I\u2019d like to highlight some of our strategic accomplishments in the last quarter. These actions aligned with our key strategies to reduce feed stock costs by improving access to North American crudes and to grow our logistic investments and Valero Energy Partners LP, our sponsored logistics partnership.","In August, we secured shipping rights and the option to purchase a 50% interest in Plain All American Diamond Pipeline. When completed in late 2016, that 440-mile pipeline will connect our Memphis refinery to the crude oil hub at Cushing Oklahoma.","Regarding Valero Energy Partners LP, we completed our first drop for $154 million in cash at the beginning of the third quarter. We also continue to advance in our capability to access and process advantage crudes during the quarter, with the commissioning of our rail unloading facility at the Port Arthur refinery.","With the startup in September, this is the third crude-by-rail facility we\u2019ve completed in the past 13 months, with the other two completed facilities located at our St. Charles and Quebec City refineries.","As mentioned in the release, we are also progressing on our other key investments as part of our strategy, including the completion of investments to receive advantage crude at our Quebec refinery on Enbridge 9B Pipeline reversal.","We also expect to complete the hydrocracker revamp at our Meraux refinery later this quarter. Now, looking out a little further, the two crude topping units at our Corpus Christi and Houston refineries are progressing as planned.","Moving on to our quarterly results, as you saw in our earnings release we had a strong quarter. We reported third quarter 2014 earnings of $1.1 billion or $2 per share. Third quarter 2014 operating income was $1.7 billion or $1.1 billion higher than the third quarter of 2013. Most of the increase within the refining segment although the ethanol business also contributed.","Refining throughput margin in the third quarter of 2014 was $11.81 per barrel, an increase of $4.05 per barrel versus the third quarter of 2013. Wider discounts on sweet and sour crude oils versus brand and strong gasoline margins in most regions were slightly offset by weaker distillate margins versus brands in most regions and higher natural gas costs.","Also contributing to the higher throughput margin, although Quebec City refinery\u2019s higher year-over-year consumption of North American light crude in the third quarter. The refinery\u2019s feedstock diet consisted of 79% North American grades in the third quarter of 2014, which is up from 6% in the third quarter of 2013.","In addition, we realized a reduction in crude cost in our Mid-Continent region when we completed our connections with pipeline in Childress Texas. This connection allowed us to receive an incremental 40,000 to 50,000 barrels per day at Midland price WTI crude oil primarily for our McKee refinery.","Lastly, we continue to ramp up North American crude consumption in our Gulf Coast region by replacing an additional 100,000 barrels per day of foreign crude in the third quarter of 2014 versus the third quarter of 2013, with some of those volumes delivered to Port Arthur by our new rail unloading facility I mentioned earlier.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 42,000 barrels per day versus the third quarter of 2013. Less turnaround activity and higher throughput capacity utilization led to the increase in volumes which was supported by strong product exports and the increased availability of North American light crude on the Gulf Coast. We operated our refineries at 98% throughput capacity utilization for the quarter.","In our refining, cash operating expenses in the third quarter of 2014 were $3.81 per barrel, which is $0.07 per barrel higher than third quarter of 2013 due mainly to higher energy costs. The ethanol segment generated record earnings of $198 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2014 versus $113 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2013.","The increase in ethanol segment operating income was mainly due to $0.27 per gallon increase in gross margin driven by lower corn prices on an abundant corn harvest, higher production volumes from the startup of our Mount Vernon, Indiana plant. Ethanol production volumes averaged 3.6 million gallons per day in the third quarter of 2014.","General and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $180 million in the third quarter of 2014. Net interest expense was $98 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $430 million. The effective tax rate was 32.9%.","With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $6.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $4.2 billion of which $231 million was held by Valero Energy Partners LP.","Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of cash was 10.5% excluding cash held by Valero Energy Partners LP. Valero had approximately $5.6 billion and Valero Energy Partners had $300 million of available liquidity in addition to cash.","Cash flows in the third quarter included $622 million of capital expenditures of which $123 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. In the third quarter we raised our dividend for the second time this year with 10% increase. We returned $489 million in cash to our stockholders, which included $145 million in dividend payments and $344 million in purchases of approximately 7 million shares of Valero common stock.","And subsequent to the third quarter, we continue to return cash to stockholders by purchasing an additional 3 million share of common stock for $138 million, which brings our total for 2014 to 18.4 million shares for $937 million.","For 2014, we are lower in our guidance for capital expenditures including turnarounds and catalysts by $100 million to approximately $2.9 billion. We expect stay-in business capital to account for slightly less than 50% of total spending with the remainder related to growth investments primarily for logistics and advantage crude oil processing capability.","More than 50% of Valero\u2019s estimated growth investments in 2014 are for logistics, and we believe most of this will be eligible for drop-down into Valero Energy Partners LP.","Now, for 2015 capital expenditures including turnarounds and catalyst, we expect to spend approximately $2.8 billion consisting of approximately $1.8 billion for stay-in business capital and $1.3 billion for growth investments, a majority of growth investments are allocated to logistics and increase in our capability to process manage crude.","So, for modeling, our fourth quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges, Gulf Coast at 1.55 million to 1.6 million barrels per day, Mid-Continent at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day, West Coast at 260,000 to 280,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day.","We expect refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be around $4 per barrel. For our ethanol operations in the fourth quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.7 million gallons per day and operating expenses should average $0.41 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization.","We expect G&A expense excluding depreciation for the fourth quarter to be around $190 million and net interest expense should be about $95 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter should be approximately $425 million and our effective tax rate should be around 35%.","So, now I will turn the call over to Joe for a few remarks.","Joe Gorder","Well, thank you, John. And as you may have seen, last week announced that Bill Klesse has chosen to step-down as Chairman of Valero Energy\u2019s Board of Directors at the end of this year.","So, on behalf of our Valero team, we just want to thank Bill for all he\u2019s done to make this company successful over his 45-year career. And we really like to wish Marty and Bill, all the best going forward. John?","John Locke","Thank you, Joe. So, before I turn over to Q&A, I just want to clarify on the 2015 stay-in business capital should be $1.5 billion, I believe I said $1.8 billion.","So, okay, Daniel, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we will open the call to questions. During this segment, we request that callers limit each turn to two questions. The callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Okay, thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our very first question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons. Please go ahead.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons","Yes. It\u2019s Jeff Dietert with Simmons. Good morning.","Joe Gorder","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons","So my question has to do with some of your crude feedstock costs and specifically one with Saudi having raised their prices to the U.S. It appears that some of their crudes were not terribly competitive. We saw the crude imports for the total U.S. drop from 1.6 million barrels a day in April to less than 900,000 barrels a day in September while Saudi was increasing prices during that period of time.","Since then they\u2019ve had four consecutive months of price reductions. And I was wondering if you could provide some color as to how attractive the Saudi crudes have been in the market through the spring and summer? And whether or not these recent reductions in prices make them more competitive now?","Gary Simmons","Hi Jeff, this is Gary Simmons. You\u2019re exactly right. I mean the Saudi barrels that gotten to wear, we felt like they were competitive versus all alternatives. In the third quarter our volumes from the total Middle East were down considerably where we\u2019ve historically run.","We\u2019re now seeing this they\u2019re making pricing moves to bring their barrels back being competitive in the market. I would say with their recent announcement on their OSP they were competitive or at least within basic sense of marks.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons","Okay. And secondly with the Brent pricing being weak and some of the West African prices being soft, have you seen those barrels price themselves back into either of the East Coast market or the Gulf Coast market with some of the softness relative to LLS, we\u2019ve seen this fall?","Gary Simmons","Yes, Jeff. The place that we pivot first is really our Quebec refinery. And we definitely as Brent got weak, we saw some synergies start buying from West African grades again and backing out some of the grades that we were taking from U.S. Gulf Coast.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons","Yes. So both that sounds like increases in imports in a market where we\u2019ve got pretty substantial domestic production growth. Do you think domestic prices have to soften to back those imports back out of the market?","Gary Simmons","Yes. And you could kind of see that in the markets. The Brent got weak about three or four weeks ago. We started to pivot as others did. And then we\u2019ve had three straight weeks where crude goes towards in the U.S. bill. So it kind of tells you the differential has to come back off to force those barrels back into the market.","Jeff Dietert \u2013 Simmons","Thanks for your comments.","Operator","Our following question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Hi guys. Good morning.","Joe Gorder","Good morning.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","I have one request and two questions. The request is that it seems that some of the part in losses may turn out to be an emerging investment team in the sector. I know there\u2019s still a small number, but it would be helpful I think for your shareholders if in your press release somewhere that you put down what is the GP cash flow and your total number of units in the LP and also that the total LP unit. I mean even though that those numbers can be found in your VLP disclosure it\u2019s just helpful there to be in one document.","In terms of the question, with the announcement or that from one of your competitors last week in terms of their strategy in drop-down they have substantially as their rate, is there any key or more transparent strategy or data that you can put one in terms of your VLP drop-down pace or the distribution growth for the next several years?","Joe Gorder","Yes, Paul that\u2019s a fair question. This is Joe. If we look at VLP, since the IPO we\u2019ve stated that we\u2019re going to grow our distributions between 20% and 25% a year. We\u2019re in target to be in the middle to the high-end to that range. We just completed a drop and a distribution increase and we\u2019re working on the next drop.","Now, VLP is less than a year old, well we don\u2019t have a debt rating yet, we\u2019ll be in the process of getting that the next year or so. And it\u2019s our intention to be investment grade. Now, when you consider the size and the pace of our drops to VLP, our original plan was to start with the logistics assets that would be more traditional.","And that\u2019s when we said that we\u2019ve got the $800 million of EBITDA that is not a specific business unit that we have within Valero, it\u2019s assets that are used to support the rest of the operations. And so we haven\u2019t had P&Ls for them.","That being said, that we can go in and we can calculate what the EBITDA would be for those assets based on market rates and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Now, what\u2019s come up here recently is this additional set of cases that would include do you put fuel margins and process units, into the MLP.","So, we\u2019re going to take a look at everything and we\u2019re going to act accordingly. Obviously it\u2019s never simple of taking EBITDA, putting the multiple on it and the same that\u2019s what the value is. You got a lot of tax effects that need to be considered.","The other thing then is, with the use of proceeds, could they be used, I mean, I expect we\u2019re going to use them to do growth projects or to return the cash to the shareholders depending on which option has the highest returns.","One of the questions we ask ourselves is if we do accelerate the drop we\u2019re going to get some of the parts valuation increase in Valero because that\u2019s something that although we\u2019ve executed the MLP, we haven\u2019t seen it yet.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Yes. But at least based on what Tesoro and MPC reaction on the last several weeks that seems like that is started catching on as a new theme?","Joe Gorder","Yes, we see it too Paul.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Yes. A second question on the $2.8 billion next year budget is that including anything in the methanol projects? And if it is indeed going to go for FID, should we assume it is just an add-on or that you\u2019re going to compensate and adjusting it so that you still could get the $2.8 billion?","Lane Riggs","Hi Paul, Lane Riggs. That $150 million in the 2015 led to $2.8 billion, and I\u2019ll predict we\u2019re in the Phase 2 development of the project and we\u2019ll go \u2013 we\u2019ll have another review in for side view, we\u2019ll then go somewhere in the second quarter of \u201815.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","And Lane if you do go ahead should we assume you\u2019re still keep $2.8 billion or that this is incremental? In other words will you adjust your other projects so that you don\u2019t go beyond the $2.8 billion?","Lane Riggs","It is in the $2.8 billion.","Joe Gorder","Yes, Paul the $150 million \u2013 we have a $150 million as a place folder in that $2.8 million budget. If we didn\u2019t perceive with the methanol plant, we wouldn\u2019t spend that $150 million and we\u2019d be at $265 million.","Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays","Okay, got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our following question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Guys, good morning. Thanks. Congratulations on the rollover in CapEx into \u201815. I guess this is kind of a combination of a higher level question from Paul and maybe a tie on from Jeff as well as with regard to the Saudi pricing. It looks like the lower \u2013 the logistics spending is decreasing like 45% of the total down to about 30% of the growth total.","And I guess I\u2019m just wondering with the Saudi\u2019s changing their pricing and I guess I\u2019m just wondering is there a chance where some of the infrastructure in North American crude investments that have been made, do we get to a point where some of that isn\u2019t quite as necessary? Do you still have the flexibility to shift back and forth to foreign versus domestic runs in your system?","Gary Simmons","Yes, Blake. I would tell you I think we\u2019ve been very selective on what we should invest capital around logistics. We still think it makes sense that as you talked about, we haven\u2019t done anything to lose our optionality that we can continue to import the foreign barrels and Saudi makes more sense around those barrels, we haven\u2019t lost any of our optionality to be able to do that.","Joe Gorder","Yes, Blake, Gary makes a great point here. I mean, what we\u2019re dealing with the markets that are really volatile. And the opportunity today is the opportunity today and it will change tomorrow or the next day. Again, one thing that is certain is if you don\u2019t have the logistics in place to take advantage of the opportunity when it\u2019s there is gone.","And so, we feel very good about the projects that we\u2019ve undertaken. I mean, the rate approved projects to move heavy sour crudes in are very good projects for us as are the unloading facilities that we\u2019ve got. Our commitment to pipelines I think are very solid for us going forward.","And the fact that you\u2019ve got the pressure on the crude price right now affecting the start is willing us to move barrels back in. At the end of the day it\u2019s going to be good because we\u2019re going to see pressure on all of the barrels as they try to find all-mineral refinery going forward.","So, we feel pretty good about what we\u2019ve done and what we\u2019ve got on the place to do going forward.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay. Thanks. The second question is on exports. We\u2019ve seen record high utilization levels earlier this year and you mentioned product exports in your press release. For one, can you give us a capacity number of what your current capacity is?","And is that kind of one of the main drivers that\u2019s been driving this higher utilization? Because when I look at my modeling it seems like the earnings in 2012 were very comparable with where we\u2019re going to land this year and basically that insinuates it\u2019s not really that much more incentive from an economic standpoint to run, so is it simply a function of additional export capacity?","John Locke","Yes, what we did in the third quarter is we did 90,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports, that time early we went to Mexico and Latin America. We did 227,000 barrels of straight distillers and 240,000 barrels of diesel when you include the currency.","The distilled and exports went to Latin America and Europe. We still have quite a bit of capacity left. On the gasoline side, we can probably give about 255,000 barrels a day, it\u2019s around 400,000 barrels a day this to the next quarter. So, we still have a lot of room to increase our exports.","But for us, this is just an optimization that we do every day, Blake. And it\u2019s just the matter of where we can get the best net-net for the barrels. So, when you look today, the domestic diesel market is very strong. And so, some of our diesel exports have slowed down a bit as we send barrels to the best net-net market which today is some of the domestic markets.","Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our following question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone. Good morning Joe.","Joe Gorder","Hello Doug.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","And by the way, Joe congrats on your ascending to the Chairmanship as well. It\u2019s nice to see with all of the titles.","Joe Gorder","Thank you.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","My, you\u2019ve see what Tesoro has done here recently by talking about a full-service MLP. And obviously a lot of \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of different strategies seem to be going on within the space I guess Phillips is pursuing a similar kind of thing. I guess I\u2019m curious as to looking outside of the refining backyard, so to speak, how do you view your MLP vehicle strategically in terms of maybe moving beyond just what we would associate as a normal course of business in the refining?","Joe Gorder","I\u2019ll tell you Doug. We do look at it as an entity that\u2019s there to support the core business operations of Valero Energy. I mean, we\u2019ve set it up with that in tens, we set it up as a traditional logistics MLP that was going to primarily focus on transportation and terminalling assets.","Obviously the market\u2019s changing here a little bit, people are making decisions to quit, a lot of their party assets in some cases in support some of the margin, the fuels margin in the assets also. I mean, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll take a look at going forward. But our view of it is a very attractive low cost of capital way to support Valero\u2019s core business.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. I appreciate. I\u2019m going to just I\u2019ll take some follow-up offline because there are multiple costs seeking down with one but. I guess my follow-up is really, could we get your latest thinking on the fuels market, generally the gasoline market in particular.","You still have little bit refinery kind of more fold recycled then might found a buyer. And obviously there is a whole crude context has come down. So I\u2019m just kind of curious as to, what\u2019s your prognosis for the Atlantic Basin gasoline market and should we expect the kind of resilience in parts we\u2019ve seen in these last couple of years, of these known supply risk emerging on the margins? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","John Locke","Thanks Joe.","Joe Gorder","Yes, I guess two separate questions, I don\u2019t know, Lane, do you want to address the root one first.","John Locke","Go ahead on the gasoline.","Gary Simmons","Yes. Overall, I think we see gasoline demand in the Atlantic Basin fairly flat. And so, a lot of the question on the Atlantic Basin is really going to be what happens in Western Europe, and do you have rationalization occur in Western Europe, and that would probably be the big driver on the overall supply-demand balances in the Atlantic Basin moving forward.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Would that assume, you don\u2019t have an acute exports on higher I\u2019m guessing?","Gary Simmons","Yes.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. And on the pipe of diesel, do you see, in part of the Gulf Coast markets, particularly?","Joe Gorder","Hi Doug, look, I think that project is going to be a bit challenged. And I mean, if they\u2019re producing gasoline, it\u2019s going to have to go somewhere so we\u2019ll probably see at the market. But I would stack up the competitive position of our Gulf Coast refineries against any refinery like that.","Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. All right, you don\u2019t have the sum. Thanks a lot Joe. I appreciate your time.","Joe Gorder","Thanks.","Operator","Our following question comes from Brad Heffer from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Brad Heffer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, everyone.","Joe Gorder","Good morning.","Brad Heffer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","So, going back, sort of to an earlier question, has there been any change as to the demand that you guys are seeing in export markets currently?","Joe Gorder","No, I would tell you from the third quarter to the fourth quarter what I would expect is that our exports will probably be up a little bit, most of that will be gasoline exports will increase into the fourth quarter, just to the exports probably fairly flat which is difficult for us. Gasoline, typically the exports are little stronger in the fourth quarter and the first quarter and follow-up when we hear the December driving season here in the U.S.","Brad Heffer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, got you. And then, you had a competitor last week talking about sort of a tight MIA market on the Gulf Coast. I was wondering if you guys have seen that and having difficulty to getting sort of the heavier crudes in the door?","Joe Gorder","Our MIA volumes for the third quarter were right at our contract levels and up about 20,000 barrels a day what we had in the second quarter.","Brad Heffer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our following question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great. Thanks good morning gentlemen. A couple of questions, maybe one, if you could talk a little bit about capture rate across very strong capture rate we saw across the portfolio this quarter, and I realize the following crude prices probably increase the profitability at the bottom of the barrel.","But outside of that, can you talk about maybe any other drivers of strong profitability and how sustainable maybe some of those might be on go-forward quarters?","Ashley Smith","Hi Ryan, this is Ashley Smith. Yes, we performed well we had a limited turnaround activity in the quarter, so other quarters might not be as comparable when we had more turnaround activity. But a lot of the capture rate is partially due to our investments and hydrocrackers are running well. In fact, St. Charles hydrocracker is running in a \u2013 consistingly running in excessive capacity.","In addition, you saw some typical market stuff that\u2019s not in the indicator such as DGO as well we achieved in the quarter and that paid us well too.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So, probably some outage in non-recurring things but maybe at least underlying there some recurring things from your past investments, I guess it\u2019s in there?","Ashley Smith","That is \u2013 that\u2019s basically, you\u2019re always going to have some movement in items that are not in the indicator. But we also are seeing benefits from our previous investments particularly in the hydrocrackers.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, thanks. And then maybe one more on and I apologize that this is, I missed it over the call. On crude flows from Corpus feeds in Canada, I know you guys have moved some crude that\u2019s gone around there to the East Coast of Canada refining system. I mean, how much have you been moving and then how do you expect that they would change in 2015?","Joe Gorder","Yes, so we moved 124,000 barrels a day of Gulf Coast crude to Quebec, that didn\u2019t all move through Corpus. Our project at Corpus will be online and probably functional in quarter terms, for the first quarter. So, we\u2019ll start using our corporate assets in the first quarter. The volume we move was largely over third party logistics assets that we move to Quebec.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And if you just look at, I mean, when you look at the 2015 dynamics both on the line 9B, eventual startup and capacity. Is that a number that you think you can grow substantially in 2015 or are there some limits there?","Joe Gorder","Well, when line 9 starts up, we will run less barrels from the U.S. Gulf Coast than what we ran in the third quarter and we\u2019ll supply more Quebec\u2019s flowing through line 9.","Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. All right, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","Our following question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, good morning.","Joe Gorder","Hello Roger.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Just to pick up a little bit more on sort of the CapEx for \u201815, and maybe for \u201816 with the crude topping projects in I guess Corpus and Houston. And then maybe what the decision timeframe is on that?","And I\u2019m thinking also all right, crude softened up a little bit, and they see some slowdown eventually in U.S. production if that has any impact on your thinking? And then whether or not the recent developments on the crude exports side, the DOE or EIA\u2019s report on gasoline prices being driven by brand not by domestic prices is sort of shot across the bow for being in favor of exports \u2013 crude exports?","Lane Riggs","Hi Roger, this is Lane. To answer your questions about crude units, there are crudes and they are under construction, we\u2019re building on them. We\u2019ll right now, we\u2019re forecasting will be complete, mechanically complete into next year for oil and roughly at the beginning of the first quarter of \u201816, somewhere in that timeframe.","In terms of the project basis economics, we assume that LLS is parity of brand and that\u2019s not what we recorded for those are still good projects. They aggregate around 30% in that pricing environment.","So we still feel it\u2019s a really good project. Ultimately not backing out our intermediate purchases, we\u2019re beginning, we\u2019re long converging capacity, sort of the day, we have to get to the market to buy intermediate in West Africa and then in the North Sea. And this sort of changes our feedstock the way we\u2019re going to feed our system.","And what was the second question?","Joe Gorder","Yes, Roger, could you restate your second question.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yes, it was just more along the lines of I was pointing out with the EIA having come out with that report on gasoline, whether that had any impact on these projects overall. I mean, originally these were going to be online in \u201815, so I was just trying to figure out if you were maybe the question is why are they now \u201816 instead of \u201815, or just delayed on construction or was there \u2013 you\u2019re looking at it internally and showing well, if things change maybe we don\u2019t want to go forward?","Lane Riggs","Now, the projects were always sort of in the fourth quarter \u201815, first quarter \u201816 and it\u2019s about mechanical completions versus oil and bay. There has not been any delay with them or not, it\u2019s about these projects and we\u2019re going forward with them. Because we\u2019re not really about trying to produce more gasoline and more diesel this is about trying to feed our system more economically right with domestic role, which were imported in release.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And then, as you look at the fourth quarter here relative to the third quarter in terms of what we\u2019ve seen in crude differentials. How is it shaking up for you, I mean, I know we can look at the screens and make our guesses but are you seeing anything significantly different in terms of the Gulf Coast, let\u2019s call it the light-heavies here?","Joe Gorder","No, not anything too significant. Overall when you look at the LLS market in Mars, Mars continues to price competitive with LLS. And I think the heavies continue to price competitively with Mars.","As you move west in the Gulf, you start to see a bigger advantage to run some of the light sweep, but that\u2019s not too different from what we saw in the third quarter.","Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our following question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good morning.","Joe Gorder","Good morning.","John Locke","Good morning, Phil.","Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan","Yes, a couple of questions. First, first one is just on the cash flow for the quarter and just the \u2013 what\u2019s the working capital contribution might have been. I know there is a few sizable negatives in the first quarter for working capital. I wasn\u2019t sure if there was a reversal of the big positive over the fourth quarter of last year, just kind of where we stand on working capital in general and how to think about that in the fourth quarter?","Mike Ciskowski","Okay. Our change in cash for the quarter was an increase of $700 million. And of that amount about $300 million of that was attributable to working capital so we had an increase in our payables receivable in that. So that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s going to be a timing issue most likely.","Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan","And for the fourth quarter, any thoughts on whether there is additional contribution?","Mike Ciskowski","Towards the end of the year, as we manage around the life of inventory levels there, things so that we could have a reduction in our working capital.","Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then, just with respect to the cash flow generation profile in general obviously, very strong and your stock is cheaper around free cash flow yield than most refiners.","So I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about kind of impacting that valuation rather, you\u2019ve talked \u2013 obviously talked about the MLP structure as an opportunity but whether it\u2019s increasing buybacks or meaningful step-up in the dividend or something else you can do to change the game? I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re thinking about things?","Joe Gorder","Phil, that\u2019s a good question. I mean, when we look at the use of cash, we\u2019ve got some very good projects. So we\u2019re going to continue with the projects that we have underway these very strong returns and they make us much more efficient.","And we realize that there is a balance between investments for growth in returning cash to shareholders. Now, I think our actions in the third quarter and through this year really reflect its realization. And we\u2019ve had two dividend increases and we\u2019ve had increased share repurchases while continuing with the growth projects that improve our overall business.","And to the extent that we have free cash flow going forward and to the extent that there are, tremendous capital projects to use the cash for. I think you can see us continue on this path. And we\u2019ll be comfortable with returning it to shareholders.","Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll turn it on.","Operator","Our following question comes from Mohit Bhardwaj from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks for taking my question. Joe, if you could just tackle this follow-up on your comments about the landing mason. If you look at where the crude prices are right now and it seems like there is excess crude supply in the Atlantic Basin. What do you think it does for the refining business in the U.S. and how do you think production moves or these supply moves going forward?","Joe Gorder","Okay, I\u2019ll let Gary Simmons give you a shot at that.","Gary Simmons","Very difficult to state. I think the key question there, is what is the marginal cost of production in North America versus other regions in the globe, and of course we\u2019re not an upstream company. So, I don\u2019t really know how all that shakes out.","I think the assumption you\u2019re kind of making with the question is that as crude price falls in the North American production falls with, the flat price falls. And that may happen, but I really don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not sure to be able to comment on that.","Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup","Right. So, if you look at third quarter versus fourth quarter, one other thing that you said for the third quarter was that you were utilizing the front of the refining, a lot more is sort of little bit more in utilizing the downstream, it\u2019s little less and where the VGO prices and availability of light speed crude. Or do you think that\u2019s still the case in the fourth quarter?","Joe Gorder","Lane.","Lane Riggs","I\u2019ll try to take a shot at this, this is Lane. Our signals in the third quarter were obviously max on everything. And to the extent that we\u2019re signaled around high crude rate half way to the 1,000 crude margins. And we had really good converging unit margins because VGO prices were inexpensive.","We still see those signals going forward in the fourth quarter, they\u2019re not as strong as they were in the third quarter but they\u2019re still have signals put on our system relatively bold.","Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup","Right. And one final one from me, just on the diamond pipeline. So, just to be clear, you guys have not exercised the 50% option on the pipelines yet? And if you could also follow-up on if you look at some of your peers were talking about doing a study on cap line and you were the main consumer as far as Memphis refinery is concerned on cap line. Does diamond pipeline option also allow you to sort of if there is a reversible cap line to participate in that?","Joe Gorder","Rich, do you want to?","Rich Lashway","Yes, I\u2019ll take a crack at that. So, the diamond pipeline is progressing. It is connected it will be connected to the cap line. So, today, we\u2019re connected \u2013 Memphis is connected to the cap line pipeline. So we have dual supply source into the Memphis refinery potentially and be able to take advantage of a reversal.","I think they\u2019re just undertaking a study as we speak, so maybe some time before that actually becomes reality.","Joe Gorder","As far as the option on the diamond pipeline.","Rich Lashway","So, yes, I\u2019m sorry, I missed that first part. So, on the option, we have not exercised the option. We have that option through early January of \u201816 to make that decision.","Mohit Bhardwaj \u2013 Citigroup","All right. Thank you for taking my questions.","Joe Gorder","Sure Mohit.","Operator","Our following question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good afternoon guys.","Joe Gorder","Good morning, Evan.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Joe, can you walk us through the decision to reduce 2015 CapEx sequentially from \u201814 and is that a top-down decision to raise distributable cash or a function of higher hurdle rates or the project queue, particularly in relation to midstream?","Joe Gorder","No, is it related to the midstream?","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","It is just in total, you ditched down sequentially, is that a desire to increase distributable cash flow or a function of how those each projects shook out in the review process?","Joe Gorder","No, it\u2019s the latter. As we \u2013 we started with a list of projects. And if you look at it from the refining perspective, Lane has the process that he goes through tremendous rigorous review. And I think the fact that he\u2019s got this rigorous review shows up in the timing on the methanol project, right.","It\u2019s a big project, and we want to be sure that we\u2019ve got the capital right. So he\u2019s going through this in a very methodical way, just to be sure on target. We put together a list of prospective projects and we do this every year. And what we\u2019re doing now is we, our list of projects that we talk about are those we scrubbed at the point that we feel that there is a reasonable probability that we\u2019re going to do them.","So, the projects we feel we could execute next year from either the refining side or the logistic side, as we\u2019ve included in the budget, we feel we\u2019re fairly committed to that 2.65 million numbers, $150 million from ethanol is kind of let\u2019s see what we get.","But it is a kind of bottom-up, what projects do we have to take a look at and then we look at it from the top-down and say these are the ones that we want to undertake based on the return thresholds.","There is though, a general view among this management team that we\u2019d like to try to return more cash to shareholders. And so, having a capital and having our capital at this level is something we\u2019re very comfortable with. We believe it creates that proper value between, proper balance between continued investment to grow and optimize the business and rewarding the shareholder for his loyalty to us.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And just for clarification, I think in the opening, you stated that midstream is 50% of that growth CapEx, it releases 30% which would be sequentially down. Is it, which of the two is midstream is a function of growth?","Joe Gorder","No, I think if you look at \u201814 versus \u201815, we\u2019ve got significant investment for example in the rail carts in 2014. That falls off. We have it intentionally tried to reduce the investments that we\u2019re making in the midstream side of the business. Okay, what we\u2019ve got is probably timing issues here, developing the projects in the form where we\u2019re willing to put them in to the capital budget, that\u2019s all we\u2019re dealing with.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. So, mid \u2013 plus $390 million I guess its $390 million I presume if it\u2019s that 30% figure. And then, should we, is that right?","Ashley Smith","Hi Evan, this is Ashley. Yes, you\u2019re correct. So, we\u2019re going from \u201814, it was over 50% of our capital with the logistics and it\u2019s because of rail power is falling off, it\u2019s going to be next year, little over 30%. And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s right around $400 million in logistics.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. So, the MLP, I believe the EBITDA exists be around $70 million-ish kind of estimate, is that reasonable?","Ashley Smith","It certainly keeps growing.","Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Right, great. All right, good luck. I look forward to your analysis of larger scope of droppable assets and good results guys.","Joe Gorder","Thanks a lot.","Ashley Smith","Thanks Evan.","Operator","Our following question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, pretty soon we\u2019re just going to call this logistics conference calls as opposed to refining conference calls.","Joe Gorder","We did notice that Ed.","Gary Simmons","If they\u2019re truly higher, we\u2019ll do it.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes. I will be most pulled arbitrage is pretty obvious. But, so let\u2019s carry on that lane. So, diamond pipe, any sort of color on the EBITDA that that might contribute if you guys work with that plan or overall investment level?","Mike Ciskowski","Well, I think we\u2019ve talked about the cost being approximately $900 million, and when we look at a proper most pulling around 10 times that would give you $90 million and 50% of that would kind of back you into $45 million of EBITDA.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. And then, another strategic, I mean, obviously I don\u2019t know, you must have seen the EPG Oil-Tanking Acquisition which was somewhat elevated multiple. And obviously assuming that there was going to be a lot of export drugs to obviously drive throughputs and drive that multiple down.","So, I look at your logistics and your refining system in Texas, I look at what Phillip 66 has done at Vermont and the Bakken pipe project as associated with that. I look at the Permian and the Eagle Ford and still growing, and I think there has to be something to be done. So, how, am I off in terms of the landscape or while that, competitive barriers for you being able to compete as effectively?","Joe Gorder","I mean, there is competitive barriers to everything right, but there is no reason that we can\u2019t compete effectively with this. And as I mentioned earlier, we talked about the capital. We\u2019ve included in the capital budget project we\u2019re highly confident we\u2019re going to do. The one exception is that methanol plant, I\u2019m not saying we will or won\u2019t do it we\u2019re just still in the process of looking at it.","But we\u2019ve got a lot of logistics projects right now that Rich Lashway and his team are in the process of developing. They\u2019re not far enough well to include in the capital budget but they would be logistics type path that would use to support the existing refining portfolio. And there\u2019s some of them that look like they are very good projects.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then, I should ask a refining question. The turnarounds obviously were pretty high as you connected up a lot of the hydrocrakers and did lot of reliability work in \u201812 and \u201813, and obviously still in the second quarter in off seeds.","Easy to see, how good your throughputs were in the third quarter. As you look out from here, I mean, do you feel that you have a more reliable refining system or is that still more work that needs to be done to get the reliability to where you need it to be? And maybe a comment on general turnaround schedules into next year?","Lane Riggs","Yes, this is Lane. So, our last really big liability projects we did and we\u2019re looking at systems that in the quarter and that were replacing the reactors. We went and now we\u2019re in the process of starting up the Meraux hydrocracker which should begin, sort of reconfigure in that refiner.","We don\u2019t really have anything quite like that going forward in our capital plan. It\u2019s sort of, we\u2019re going to be in premium, doesn\u2019t really impact our throughputs per say. So, really from here going forward, we just have our round phase, our regimen of standard turnaround execution themselves.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, that was all things equal we should expect that sort of overall utilization next year and perhaps a year after than the last three year run-rate?","Lane Riggs","Yes, and we always, I mean, our number one focus on everything we do is to try, with first is safety. But right behind that is really liability. And we do never squeeze for reliability stand, is actually slowing. And we\u2019re pretty confident that we have spent the right money on the right things to maintain a higher liability rate in our system.","Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse","Very clear, thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company","Hi, good morning everybody.","Joe Gorder","Hi Sam.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company","Lots have been covered, I guess, I\u2019ll stick to ethanol if refining questions are I say we do. So, the business has responded really well to lower corn prices obviously results have been getting better and better. Just strategically, do you think you can, it can tolerate any kind of stabilizing business component, a tolling agreement or something like that that might make it eligible for a different structure or is this just normal volatility in the industry with a really good corn crop this year in your mind?","Joe Gorder","Martin, you want to speak to the market aspect of this.","Martin Parish","Sure, Sam, this is Martin Parish. On the market aspect, we like where we\u2019re positioned. Production has been high as you can see inventories have only built like a million barrels in total for the year. So, we feel really good, we\u2019re positioned exports are high. We think margins going forward are going to be good, we like the business.","Now, as far as the totaling type deal, I mean, Sam, what do you think in there, is this a question about doing what to monetize the business or?","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company","Yes, I suppose, I mean, it\u2019s been a pretty steady stream of better on better results in the segment until, you mentioned your similar parts earlier, I was just wondering if this sectors into it at all, I know that if maybe you see earnings getting more reliable or visible in the segment?","Joe Gorder","We like the delay at these levels forever. But I think 2012 it was, it would remind us there can be a lot of volatility in this business too. And we\u2019ve looked at this the ethanol plant portfolio and if you look at costs, there just aren\u2019t a whole bunch of them first of all.","And it tends to trade at the same multiples as the refining assets trade at. So, there is really not a big significant incentive for whether monetization through try to create additional value. At the same time, I would say that we\u2019re very pleased with the operation of the business. Martin has done a fine job leading it he\u2019s got a very settled team.","And the cash flow is being produced by these assets is tremendous. And we feel like having it as part of our core business. And we do believe long-term that ethanol is going to be fundamentally part of the fuel mix instead of having this businesses part of our portfolio makes sense.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay. And then, just touching on that as a follow-up and the RFS seemed to be a little bit behind schedule on an update here. It seems like your thesis is quite out based on refining margins, that rings were kind of being pass through. Is that, do you see that as giving momentum into maybe mandate reduction or any kind of movement at all if you can get any update that would be great?","Gary Simmons","I don\u2019t know if we have lot of insight here. I think we feel like it\u2019s going to be after the elections here before we get the new RBO. And it\u2019s so late in the year at this stage that we don\u2019t think it will be potentially different from where we were last year.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay, great.","Joe Gorder","It is pretty interesting that we\u2019re here in November we don\u2019t know what the 2014 obligation number is yet.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company","Interesting is one word for it, yes, I guess.","Joe Gorder","Thank you, Pal.","Sam Margolin \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay. Well, thanks a lot guys. Have a good one.","Joe Gorder","Okay, you too.","Operator","Our following question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Hi, good morning everyone.","Joe Gorder","Hi, good morning Paul.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","You\u2019ve covered a lot of ground here with getting to the point of the ethanol MLP. I wanted to ask you a follow-up on that one. Could we just sort of be able to gather a bit here Joe, what concerns I mean, I think we were hoping for quite a significant debt down in CapEx late this year?","And what I\u2019m listening to is that you\u2019re competing in a mature market, but you\u2019re still spending on these numbers about doubled your maintenance or stay-in business CapEx, would be remained at being obviously growth CapEx? Can\u2019t we get to a place where you are much more aggressive about cash return to shareholders as the kind of predominant aim?","I heard good stuff about you potentially not doing any methanol project but at the same time there seems to be a potential for logistics and to step up, and I would say, to me, this is a CapEx number which is kind of flat next year with this year whereas we were hoping for something that is quite a bit lower? Thanks.","Joe Gorder","Okay, Paul, I know this has been your perspective. We look at the capital, okay. We got $1.4 billion or $1.5 billion that we spend on the assets to maintain them the way we want to maintain them.","We\u2019ve got the crude unit project which have 25% plus rates of return, and they\u2019re not putting anymore juice in the market per say. They\u2019re optimization projects. We\u2019ve got the opportunity to drop at higher multiples logistics assets. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in those. If you extract the methanol plant $150 million our place holder from the $2.8 billion or $2.65 billion that is well below the $3 billion that we forecasted this year.","And we don\u2019t arbitrarily select projects to undertake to outlook if the alternative use for the cash. And so, if we\u2019re deciding to do a capital project, I think we\u2019re very comfortable making our day in sports in sharing what the returns are going to look like on this and why it\u2019s a better alternative to us and repurchasing shares for example.","So, I do think that this management team has reduced the capital spend, I think if we look at it going forward with the rigor we have in the process and the thresholds we\u2019re setting for acceptance of the projects, we\u2019re going to see this continue to be at this level. It may continue to decline. But I don\u2019t want to not do projects that improve the operation of the business and have good returns when they are available to us.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Yes, then I guess the plan is really what you\u2019re saying is you have to see European refineries shut down, it will also make room for some of the stuff. And thus, it\u2019s the concern we have there is too much capital going into the business overall that\u2019s kind of dependent on the competitive environment moving into favor?","Joe Gorder","Okay.","Gary Simmons","Paul, keep in mind, our projects are designed principally to reduce feedstock cost. And if we have cheaper crude, we\u2019re going to shut down that\u2019s going to force excess capacity and you have to shut down, so we will become more competitive.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Great. And just my final part of this is, what do you think a competitive return to shareholders is, you\u2019ve got a couple of percent yield. Can you just talk a little bit more about that Joe and I\u2019ll leave it there? Thanks.","Joe Gorder","I\u2019m sorry Paul, real quick you\u2019re talking about is VLP or are you talking about Valero Energy?","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Well, just yes, for example if I own a Valero share, how do you think, what do you think of this being a good return to the shareholder in terms of you saying that you respect full of cash return to shareholders?","Joe Gorder","From a cash perspective or just total?","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Yes, total side. I mean, people obviously prefer regular dividend but I understand that they look at the business makes sense, a tough commitment to discuss?","Joe Gorder","Okay. And I think what we would say is we have a cost of capital, we got a cost of capital there which","We haven\u2019t set a target per say, but 10% range, 12% range and it\u2019s certainly going to be the dividend, the share repurchase aspect of it. But we recognize that we\u2019ve got a need to exceed counts of capital on our projects in our business.","Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research","Understood. Thank you very much, Joe.","Operator","Last question comes from Allen Good from Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Good morning, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be brief, it\u2019s getting here late. Suncor CEO made some comments last week about shipping medium heavy to Europe and down the U.S. Atlantic Coast and even to a Gulf Coast. Do you think there is a viable alternative long-term to get greater, heavy volumes to the Gulf Coast and could that even be a potentially a source of opportunity for Pembroke at some point?","Joe Gorder","Yes. So, of course for us, I think we feel like there is, better options to get Canadian heavy to the U.S. Gulf Coast and taking it to the East Coast and around. But absence of any of those opportunities moving forward, we definitely see it\u2019s an option to get additional heavy side to the Gulf. And we also see that there is an opportunity to move the Canadian barrels to Pembroke as well.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Great, thanks. And then, could you just give us an update on the projects you have either to weigh or sort of on a planned stages to increase competitiveness of California and get some discount crude out there and just your latest thoughts on your assets out there as well?","Lane Riggs","Allen, this is Lane. That would also we are still working on the Venetian rail project. Our comments her are, we\u2019re working on those, answering all the questions and we sort of expect that to be finished in December. We think permits would be issued in the first quarter.","That\u2019s really the \u2013 in terms of the strategic capital that we have spending on the West Coast, that\u2019s pretty much it. Everything else would be very careful in our, spend on the West Coast. Because we have obviously great opportunities in our Gulf Coast and our Mid-Continent market on North Eastern capital.","So, we\u2019re very careful, we run a very tight shift out there and that\u2019s sort of how we\u2019re managing the West Coast.","Joe Gorder","And then, from a strategic perspective, we think it\u2019s great to have good assets with strong management teams out there that provide us the option to take advantage of the strong market environment we have from time to time out there.","Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar","Great. Thanks I appreciate it.","Operator","Okay. We have no further questions at this time, yes sorry.","Joe Gorder","Well, that\u2019s okay.

If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions about the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I will turn the call over to Joe for an update on company operations and strategy.","Joseph Gorder","Well, thanks very much, John, and good morning, everyone. Well, as John will cover in more detail momentarily, we did have a great fourth quarter and a great year. What I'd like to do is spend a few minutes discussing our key strategies and highlight a few of our accomplishments in the quarter.","As you have seen from our recent disclosure, our strategies are focused on operations excellence, returning capital to stockholders, maintaining disciplined capital investments and unlocking asset value. Operations excellence continues to be important to us. Our team understands that reliability drive safe and profitable operations, so we are relentlessly committed here.","An example of this can be seen in our Meraux refinery, where we completed our reliability improvement program and the hydrocracker revamp project. We expect the investments we've made here to improve the refinery for liability and performance.","Disciplined capital allocation is another key focus for us. Last week, we increased our regular cash quarterly dividend by 45% to $0.40 per share or $1.60 annualized. This increase demonstrates our belief in Valero's earnings power and our commitment to returning cash to stockholders.","Regarding capital investments, we completed our 2014 capital program under budget, as noted in the release. This resulted from the rigor and discipline that Lane and his team applied to spending throughout Valero's gated project management process. We're committed to applying the same rigor to future investments.","The majority of our growth investments for 2015 and 2016 are allocated to logistics, and to increasing our capability to access and process advantage crude oil for our flexible refining system. We expect the majority of the logistics investments to be eligible for future drops to Valero Energy Partners, which is our sponsored master limited partnership.","On the topic of VLP, we're committed to its growth and unlocking value. As we noted in the release, we're targeting approximately $1 billion of drops into VLP in 2015. At that level of growth, we also expect VLP's distribution to exceed the 50% tier for our general partner and incentive distribution rights by the end of this year.","We're continuing to evaluate and structure new potential earning streams that can be dropped to VLP, and those represent incremental growth opportunities. We understand the MLP landscape has changed since our IPO, and we're committed unlocking value.","In summary, we're focused on operational excellence, disciplined capital allocation and value creation. Our team remains committed to high performance and achievement.","And with that, John, I'll go ahead and turn it over to you to cover the results.","John Locke","Thank you, Joe. As shown in our earnings release, we had another strong quarter. We reported fourth quarter 2014 earnings from continuing operations of $1.2 billion or $2.22 per share. Adjusting for special items described on Page 7 of the financial table that accompany our release, we are at $952 million or $1.83 per share, which compares to $963 million or $1.78 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.","For the full year 2014, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $3.7 billion or $6.97 per share. Adjusting for special items, we earned $3.5 billion or $6.68 per share in 2014 versus $2.4 billion or $4.41 per share in 2013.","The refining segment reported fourth quarter 2014 operating income of $1.9 billion versus $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Nearly all of the $377 million increase in operating income resulted from the previously noted special items.","Excluding the special items, operating income was flat in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus the fourth quarter of 2013, as stronger gasoline, distillate and other product margins relative to Brent crude oil as well as higher refining throughput volumes were offset by lower discounts for sweet and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil.","Refining throughput volumes averaged 2.8 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2014, which is an increase of 41,000 barrels per day versus the fourth quarter of 2013. Refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $3.76 per barrel, which is $0.03 per barrel lower than the fourth quarter of 2013.","The ethanol segment generated $158 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2014 versus $269 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The decrease in Ethanol segment operating income was mainly due to a $0.31 per gallon decrease in gross margin, driven by lower gasoline and ethanol prices with relatively stable corn prices. Production from the Mount Vernon plant contributed to record quarterly ethanol production volumes, which averaged 3.8 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2014.","General and administrators expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, were $214 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, which is $35 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to changes in legal reserves. Also in the fourth quarter of 2014, net interest expense was $101 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $425 million.","The effective tax rate was 28.4%. The rate was lower than normal, due primarily to earnings from our international operations that were higher than projected and taxed at statutory rates that are lower than in U.S., the biodiesel blender's tax credit that was passed into law in December and a reversal of certain tax reserves. With respect to our balance sheet, at quarter end total debt was $6.4 billion and cash and temporary cash investments were $3.7 billion, of which $237 million was held by VLP.","Valero's debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash and excluding VLP was 17.4%.Valero had approximately $6.1 billion of available liquidity in addition to cash, including VLP's $300 million of available liquidity. Cash flows in the fourth quarter included $857 million in capital expenditures, of which $157 million was for turnarounds and catalysts.","In the fourth quarter we returned $640 million in cash to our stockholders, which included $143 million in dividend payments and $497 million in purchases of approximately 10.3 million shares of Valero common stock. Our total cash returned to stockholders for 2014 was $1.9 billion, a 33% increase over 2013, and included $554 million in dividend payments and purchases of 25.7 million shares for $1.3 billion.","For 2015 and 2016, we maintain our guidance for capital expenditures, including turnarounds and catalysts. In 2015, we expect to spend approximately $2.65 billion, consisting of approximately $1.5 billion for same business capital and $1.15 billion for growth investment, and this excludes $150 million for St. Charles methanol project that remains under evaluation.","For 2016, we expect to spend approximately $2.4 billion, consisting of $1.4 billion for stay-in-business capital and $1 billion for growth investments, excluding $300 million for the St. Charles methanol project.","For modeling, our first quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall in the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.45 million to 1.5 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 240,000 to 260,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 to 470,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be around $4.20 per barrel.","For ethanol operations in the first quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.7 million gallons per day. And operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for non-cash cost such as depreciation and amortization.","We expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation for the first quarter to be around $170 million and net interest expense should be about $100 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter should be approximately $449 and our effective tax rate should be around 33%.","Operator, we have concluded our opening remarks. In a moment, we will open the call to questions. During this segment, we request that our callers limit each turn to two questions. Callers may rejoin the queue with additional questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first comes from Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Chi Chow","I've got a couple of questions regarding your very strong performance in the Gulf Coast region. I guess, first, can you explain the gross margin adjustments you've shown in the back of the table, in particularly that blender's tax credit and how that's going to be sustainable going forward? And then secondly, even with the adjustments, it looks like your capture rate was very strong sequentially versus 3Q, when all the indicated cracks were down. And just wondering if you could explain some of the factors that were coming into play versus the indicated?","Michael Ciskowski","The blender's tax credit, that was passed into the law in December for 2014, so it was available to us last year. At this point it's not hatch for 2015, so we would not have that in our earnings going forward.","Joseph Gorder","And on the margin capture, Gary, you want speak to that.","Gary Simmons","Yes. I would say, in the Gulf Coast margin capture is largely attributable to great performance from the hydrocrackers in terms of refinery operation. And then we also begin to see some good advantages on running some of the South American heavy sour crude again in our Gulf Coast system in fourth quarter.","Chi Chow","How much impact was there, just with the decline in crude prices? And is that something that if crude prices stabilize or eventually increases kind of the capture rate going to switch there versus what we saw in the fourth quarter?","Gary Simmons","We definitely see some benefits in terms of capture rate and a lower flat price. It's mainly the other products that we produce, the sulfur and coke, LPG, those types of things. Now, when the flat price is lower we tend to have higher capture rate, because those products tend to be a little sticky with crude.","Chi Chow","I guess one final question on the Gulf Coast. Looks like the Maya light\/heavy differentials is pretty wide here in the first quarter so far on percentage basis. How has your crudes slate changed versus 4Q? It looks like you ran a lot of light crudes in the fourth quarter. Has that change here going forward? And do you have any sort of earnings sensitivity for the Maya spread?","Gary Simmons","Yes. I guess to answer the question on our crude diet, we tend to buy crude out quite a ways. So probably the first month you start seeing a significant change in our crude diet would be large. And we have started to move in the direction that exactly what you talked about as several of our Gulf Coast refiners were backing down on some of the light domestic type crude and starting to run a higher percentage of medium sour crudes and heavy sour crudes, those have been more economic for us to process in the Gulf.","Chi Chow","So do you have any sort of EPS sensitivity to changes in the light\/heavy?","Joseph Gorder","No, actually we don't.","Operator","The next question comes from Brad Heffern from RBC Capital Markets.","Brad Heffern","You all announced a pretty substantial dividend increase last week I think. Has that changed your thoughts at all on the buyback? And how do you think about dividend versus buyback in general and then versus capital projects or acquisitions?","Joseph Gorder","Mike, you want to?","Michael Ciskowski","Yes. We're working really to returning more of our cash to our stockholders based on our analysis of the market data and capital allocation scenarios. We are still interested in higher return projects, but our capital is down, projected as we disclosed, so we thought it was appropriate to increase the dividend at that level. So we're going to be looking at exceeding our payout ratio going forward in 2015 on what we've had the last couple of years.","Joseph Gorder","As far as our consideration of the dividend versus buybacks, when we did the analysis and looked at where our dividend was relative to the peer group, we felt that we were a little bit low. And so this type of move was something to get us more aligned with the other guys. It is also something that we view as being non-discretionary when we look at our use of cash going forward. The share repurchases, we are committed to trying to achieve a metric that we defined internally, and we're going to continue to pursue that as Mike said, but that will be more flexible for us than the dividend, which we consider to be, as I mentioned, non-discretionary.","Brad Heffern","And then looking at refined product exports for the fourth quarter, do you have a figure that you can provide us how much you exported? And can you also talk about how demand is looking for those exported barrels?","Gary Simmons","Yes. In the fourth quarter we did 139,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports. On the distillate side, ULSD, we did 280,000 barrels a day. In addition to the ULSD, we also exported kerosene and jet, and if you included that total distillates would be 255,000 barrels a day.","In terms of the current market, I would tell you we're starting to see some incentive to export gasoline again, especially to Latin America and to Canada. Most of the distillate are through strength in the Gulf, there is not a lot of incentives to do much distillate export in the current market.","Operator","The next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.","Phil Gresh","Just a follow-up on the capital allocation question. You talk about having a payout ratio that exceeds 50% of net income for 2014. Consensus actually has EPS down year-over-year. You also have some excess cash. You have just accelerated drop program. So I was just trying to calculate how high you're comfortable going in 2015 as a percentage of net income, if indeed consensus is right?","Joseph Gorder","Well, I figured that you'd probably ask a question like this. And really the target we've set is the one we've stated, it's to exceed the previous year. Now, as I mentioned previously, internally we've got a target that would be higher than that. But I am not prepared right now to give you a fixed percentage for the overall payout ratio.","I just think we need to see how the year evolves. Look at the dynamic nature of the market that we are dealing with today. Are we're seeing crude go from a $100 late last year to $50 this year. And so for me to give you a committed number right now is something that's probably just wouldn't be prudent to do. So I think for now, if I were you, I would just assume that we're going to exceed the 50% target and go with that.","Phil Gresh","And that actually keens up my next question, which is just in your general outlook for the market, as we exit '16, it's starting to look like crude oil production growth could actually be down year-over-year. There is talk of increased global refine capacity. So given this dynamic market, I'd love to hear your general big picture views and just how you're thinking about planning for this type of environment?","Joseph Gorder","That's a fine question. Gary Simmons is so very close to this, let us let him go ahead and comment on it.","Gary Simmons","So overall, I think we see that the crude market will continue to be in a oversupplied position for foreseeable future. I think the fact that the Saudis have signaled that they are going to continue to put medium sour barrels on the market will mean that our medium sour differential should remain supportive. The combination of that with additional Canadian heavy into the Gulf, we believe it will give us good heavy sour differentials as well. So both of those things we think are very supportive in terms of our Valero's performance moving forward.","When you turn to the refined product side, I think it's a little unclear at this stage to see exactly what will happen with refinery margins. However, we think that the fall off in flat price, we should see a positive demand response, and you have been able to see that in the past few weeks from the DOE stats. And so as demand increases, that should also be supportive of refining margins.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Cheng","Two questions. First, if I look at your margin capture rate against your Valero index that you posted in your website, it was quite amazing that the last two year, 2013 and 2014 versus the two year before in 2011, 2012, your capture rate actually improved somewhere between 3% to 9% between these two period, with the exception of the West Coast.","So wondering if you can have a stat, I'm trying to quantify, how much of the improvement you think is just that the market condition is just in favor of your configuration and how much of that is really based on the better operation, reliability that you guys has been able to improve? And how much is related to the large capital investment in the previous years you guys have made and have subsequently come on stream. The second question -- or that you want to answer that before I go to the second?","Joseph Gorder","Paul, I'd tell you, we'll let Garry speak to this, but just as member of management for last several years, I'd like first to take credit for all of it. That being said, Garry, you want to give your view.","Gary Simmons","Yes. So I will tell you, Paul, probably you have to look at this regionally. And when you look to the Mid-Continent, some of our improvement capture rate has just been due to the fact that the Midland market has been very disconnected from the Cushing market over the past couple of years and the wider Midland spreads. We're running a lot of Midland barrels to Ardmore and McKee, it certainly helped our capture rates there.","Same thing in the North Atlantic Basin. I would say a lot of that is market driven. Especially as we transition Quebec from a foreign crude diet to a North American light sweet crude diet. We saw a significant increase in our capture rate there. However, in the Gulf, I would say that the improvement in capture rate is primarily just the fact that we're seeing a lot better yield and the operational improvements we've made in our Gulf Coast at this time.","Paul Cheng","And how much is the benefit is just coming from the investment that you guys have been making. Is there any way that we can quantify it?","Joseph Gorder","In the recent analyst presentations we've put together, we have included a lot of information on the economics associated with the projects. And the hydrocrackers are the one that we tend to focus on. I think what you can expect is that we'll continue to disclose this information as we go forward. And we obviously believe when the capital that's been invested over the last several years, it's had a significant effect, not only in, for example, the hydrocracker projects in driving the capture rates relative to more distillate production, but the increase in the reliability in our system and so on, it's all beneficial. We haven't tried to pin down specifically what's related to what, but I think we can all see it in the results.","Paul Cheng","A final one. I think that there is a change in your project investments decision process comparing to the past. Maybe that you can elaborate a little bit more in terms of what condition may have change or what criteria you have changed differently now?","Lane Riggs","So as you mentioned we're booking them for deliberate gated process, really what we look for are the projects that will enter our gated systems. We don't even look at them unless they have sort of 50% IRR as to gate one. And then also we right now have a tendency to be a little bit more focused towards the stock optimization, and not as nearly as large as maybe some of the projects that we did started in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.","Jeff Dietert","There has been some refining margin strength in Europe and on the U.S. East Coast, the Atlantic Basin refining margins overall have been pretty healthy relative to the other regions. Could you talk about what factors you believe are contributing to the strength as a marginal product on the U.S. East Coast? Is it supply by U.S. Gulf Coast via the Jones Act ship? Or what do you think is causing the strength in the Atlantic Basin?","Gary Simmons","I think you hit exactly on it. We saw the New York harbor market get very strong. The colonial pipeline is always full, so that means the barrel is flowing in there to set the price, it's either a barrel from the U.S. Gulf Coast on Jones Act ship or a barrel from Western Europe, and so to incentivize imports and incentivize the flow off with Jones Act ship from the Gulf, the harbor market had to strengthen.","Jeff Dietert","So Jones Act laws are actually increasing prices on the East Coast?","Gary Simmons","Yes.","Jeff Dietert","Secondly, I was hoping you could comment on the EPA and the renewable fuel standard, and what you're anticipating could happen there? Rents prices have risen with the uncertainty that's been created there. Could you comment on that issue?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So we're still waiting for the final numbers for '14 and the numbers for '15 to come out from the EPA. We're hopeful we'll have something by the end of March, that's kind of what we're hearing and as you pointed too. Until those numbers are set, we see the red market as being very volatile. And so we're hopeful, we'll get some direction here pretty soon from EPA.","Operator","The next question comes from Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez","My questions on the VLP drop. Appreciate the more aggressive strategy. The way I had kind of envisioned this in the past was kind of progressive increase over time. So I'm just curious, do you think the $1 billion in '15 kind of sets a baseline to where we should expect progressive increases into '16, '17, et cetera?","Joseph Gorder","This drop, as you mentioned, is really much larger than we have previously planned. But we have quite a portfolio of logistics assets, which we've mentioned and obviously this level of drop is based on the EBITDA that we have in the system will allow us to sustain this level of drops for some years to come. It's our intention to continue to drop at a pace that makes sense for Valero and for VLP.","As you know, we continue to invest in logistics projects to support the refining operations, and then Mike Ciskowski and his team are evaluating additional sources of qualifying EBITDA, so to get from the fuels distribution business. So when we look at our portfolio today, we believe that this is sustainable for some period of time.","If you look at VLP specifically, we stated in our plans were to increase the distribution 20% to 25% a year. And based on this particular drop, I think that you can expect that we're certainly going to be at the high range of that for this year and it looks like it's very sustainable going forward.","Blake Fernandez","Second question, the OpEx guidance you have of $420 a barrel, if I'm not mistaken that seemed a little bit higher than where we've been trending last year. And I'm just curious if there is anything in there that's driving that? And maybe if you could tie in with that as we kind of move more towards heavy sour runs. Should we expect that to kind of create some upward pressure on the operating cost?","Lane Riggs","So the guidance really, as a function, that we have some turnaround activity that's going to occur here late in the first quarter, so our volumes are a little bit lower. And then, I would also say, that the outlook is pretty consistent in terms of our natural gas price from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, so that's sort of the reasons we have the guidance where it is.","Blake Fernandez","And if you don't mind, just any comments on, again with the heavy sour coming back in the favor, should we think would that have kind of upward pressure on operating cost moving forward?","Lane Riggs","No. Not really.","Operator","The next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio","My first question is it's a different take on the prior question on the outlook. And you addressed the souring and heaving crude oil global slate with higher OPEC market share growing over Mexico and Canadian production. Can you discuss the developing and steepening contango and how it benefits Valero, especially given the structural way in which the crude markets are being forced to balance with the U.S. as the new swing producer?","Gary Simmons","Really the contango market structure is yet a good indication that the crude market is over supplied. And so as a buyer of crude, Valero benefits from the competition from producers to gain market share. So we think this is supported for us for at least the next couple of years.","Evan Calio","Can you quantify how much you're hedging on PI to avail one to two or one to three months contango? And how you think about your own storage assets in this market or even do you see the potential for U.S. storage filling?","Gary Simmons","So I think definitely when you look at the economics of what you can get tankage in Cushing, those economics are supportive of putting oil in tankage and storing it there. I think we'll continue to see Cushing builds. I read something this morning. They expect Cushing to continue to build about 1.5 million barrels a week until through April.","In terms of us, particularly we do some of that. We don't do a lot of it. When we choose to put barrels in storage and take advantage of contango, it's also for other reasons. So we may see an opportunistic barrel that we think has a good discount. We might not be able to fit it into our systems. So then we'll go ahead and put those in tankage in Aruba and take advantage of the contango, and also what looks to be an opportunistic purchase for us.","Evan Calio","And just second one for me, maybe more a request for detailed information, if you don't that data. But can you break down the $900 million of MLP-able EBITDA into any sub categories? And I guess, I raised a question in the sense of, one of the subcategories of recent spending in rail, and also has some commodity price exposure to that sub segment. Yet I know, however, you use a significant portion of that rail fleet to move product under ethanol, which should have relatively higher utilization tariff. Any break down or help us in the composition of the EBITDA and\/or -- sorry to make this multiple question, I didn't intend to -- or any break down in just that rail segment, how much is product in ethanol?","Joseph Gorder","That's fine. Well, because it's a multi-part question, we'll let Rich and Martin Parrish answer it. Obviously, Rich is the President of the VLP, and Martin runs the ethanol business, the renewable business. So why don't we let those two guys speak to this, and see if we can get you some color here.","Richard Lashway","So on the rail cars just to kind of break that down a little bit. So obviously they are qualifying to dropdown to VLP. We've created a company to hold these cars and our intent is to drop these cars down and trying to over time. But if you look at the cars that we have, there is a general purpose and they're coiled and insulated cars. The coiled and insulated cars, obviously, fit well into the ethanol business and coiled and insulated would fit into the asphalt and crude and fuel oil business. But our intent would be to drop these down over time in tranches.","Martin Parrish","We have about 3,000 cars in ethanol service, the general purpose cars, as Rich said. As those leases expire, we'll take those off and use the VLP cars. As you know, rail is the primary transport for ethanol, we expect these cars will be highly utilized in a good fit for VLP. ","Joseph Gorder","So now to the broader question on the $900 million, Rich, you want to provide a little more.","Richard Lashway","So if you kind of break down broadly the $900 million of EBITDA. So when we were out on the road a year ago, we talked about our retained assets. It's not about $620 million EBITDA and pride upstairs at the parent level. And from '13 and '14 we've got about $140 million [indiscernible] billion capital spending, which is mostly complete. So that would generate roughly another $140 million of EBITDA. So that kind of gives you to an 800 number.","And then in '14 we've got another $400 million of capital spending, which generates another $40 million in '16 and '17. We got large spending on our, what we've talked about in the past, the diamond pipeline and some other pipeline projects. So kind of through '17 the capital spending will get you to about $900 million of EBITDA.","Evan Calio","Maybe at some point, just color on the types, whether how much is pipeline, how much is storage, how much is rail or fuel marketing distribution to at least better highlight the drop down values given the assets have some different multiples on?","Joseph Gorder","We can sure do that. I mean obviously in this case the bulk of this is logistics assets. The number that we're scoring doesn't include anything that will be associated with the fuels marketing business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger Read","I guess maybe I had a couple questions here. You've done a fairly phenomenal job in last several quarters of outperforming volume expectations, particularly in the Gulf Coast. Clearly from guidance here you're expecting descent amount of turnarounds in the first quarter. Well, could you just sort of give us a -- is it strictly market conditions or have there been other things that have allowed you to outperform sort of volume expectations? And I'm thinking you made comments earlier about the hydrocrackers having run very well in the fourth quarter. Could you just sort of walk us through that maybe how that could imply the stronger results in the first half of the year?","John Locke","Roger, our performance, when we give guidance is based on what we plan, we plan conservatively. If the market provides opportunities and we're constantly seeking opportunity, as crude prices or as product prices change, we try to optimize. And if we have the opportunity to go after extra barrels, we'll do it, and that's kind of what you've seen in the last, beside what you talked about here.","Joseph Gorder","Well, that's the fact, and then I would tell you that the fact that we've invested capital in the business, the way we've invested it over the last several years in our commitment to continuing to maintain the high levels of our reliability and safety within our refining system, is going to contribute to this.","I think what you're beginning to see here is a realization of the value of the investments that have been made. And then the capabilities of this management team to execute to optimize the slates in, the movement of products out, and then the day-to-day operation to the refineries.","Roger Read","And then coming back to the other side of that, the comment earlier about distillate exports, not exactly being incentivized in this environment, there's all kinds of seasonal factors and other things going on. But are you seeing anything particularly different on just general volume demand sides here in the U.S.? We've seen descent data, although obviously somewhat we have to be skeptical of exactly what we see on the EI and API on a weekly basis, but look like gasoline demand is better here. And how maybe that's flowing through both in terms of the export market demand-wise not just arbitrage-wise, and then local demand as well?","Lane Riggs","Roger, so I would tell you that we have definitely -- since the flat prices have fallen off, we see greater demand for refined products on gasoline and liquid side. That's some of the reason why the Gulf has been supported. And when the Gulf has supported then we might not see quite the incentive to export, if we do. I would tell you we're still sending distillate to South America, so we still see good export demand, not necessarily quite the demand in Europe. And some of the reason for that is that just they've had mild weather in Europe, and to distillate demand has moved down there.","Roger Read","And then, just a last question is the North Atlantic margins, if you were to -- I know you don't like to do this, but if you were to break down sort of how Pembroke performed versus how Canada performed. Was there an unusual item? Both units were better, one was better and then other, just any granularity you can offer there?","Joseph Gorder","I mean you kind of preface the question by the fact that we work and answer it. So we appreciate you doing that. I mean, both refineries are performing well. And obviously, our Canadian operation, it's a very strong operation, but beyond that I don't think we want to try to get into that detail.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.","Jason Smith","It's actually Jason Smith on for Doug. Just a follow up on refining projects and being a bit more selective, can you just update us as to where the Benicia unloading facility is, first in the permit process? And then is there incentive on your end moving forward, given the recent narrowing in spreads?","Lane Riggs","So we are still working with the city to try to address all the comments that came out. We have only submitted EIR for review, and we're in the process with their folks to continue to push this forward. We're still pretty optimistic we'll get the permit. Timing at this point is a little bit difficult for us to project. I'd say some time early next year would be when we would actually get started putting the crude-by-rail project in place. And I'll let Gary speak to the economics of crude-by-rail right now.","Gary Simmons","So I would say, definitely over the last few weeks, whatever Brent TI was, we wouldn't be incentivized there to move crude-by-rail from Benicia. But we're starting to see that arc widen back out, and our view is that we'll see a wider Brent-TI than what we've seen over the last few weeks, and that we believe that we'll have an economic incentive to move the crude to Benicia.","Jason Smith","Is there anything in your '15 or '16 budget for that project at this time or is there anything else in your budget for '15 and '16 that could potentially get cut more beyond the methanol project that you guys obviously are slowing down on?","Lane Riggs","There is money budgeted in the 2015 budget to forward crude-by-rail.","Jason Smith","And then slowing down?","Lane Riggs","Literally, that will mean that we'll slow that spend down versus the budget, but we are least succeeded right now.","Jason Smith","And just one quick follow-up on the splitter projects, and you guys had talked about $500 million EBITDA in a 2014 environment. Can you give me the frame what those look like in the current environment?","Joseph Gorder","So you're talking about the crude topper projects.","Jason Smith","Yes.","Lane Riggs","Well, what I would do is refer you to our investment on our slides, we have sensitivity. So again, if you're right, the $500 million of EBITDA is based on 2014 prices. In the neighboring next phase right there, we have this whole set of sensitivity from drivers that affect the economics of that project.","Operator","The next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company.","Sam Margolin","Back to the capture rate question. I guess in light of the outperformance, and then some of the comments you just made in general about crude over supply. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some color on some crude prices that maybe aren't necessarily in the benchmark that we can't see everyday. You mentioned that South American barrels, but I was also wondering about some domestic areas, so that's Huston, South Texas and maybe even the Bakken wellhead, where you have some real exposure too, if there is some contribution for pricing there at discounts below sort of what we see on the boards.","Martin Parrish","It's difficult to get into a lot of detail. But we continue to see that if you look at an LOS related market, in terms of the eastern Gulf, the Houston market is discounted a couple of dollars below that. And then you move further west and you get into the Corpus Christi area market. And again, we see another $2 of discount off LOS for an Eagle Ford type barrel.","The same thing if you move up into the Mid-Continent, the discounts get deeper as you move up on the light sweet side. On the heavy sour side, definitely we're seeing some incentive to run a lot of the South American barrels. The biggest switch without going into a lot of details on discounts, as the Canadian differentials came in, we started to see an advantage to switch to more Brazilian grades and less Canadian grades, and that's an optimization we do everyday.","Sam Margolin","And then switching gears to the dropdown commentary. So the MLP space has obviously been really volatile, VLP has outperformed. So I'm wondering if there is any consideration or any effect on sort of valuation of drop downs in general. There was a question before about the valuation spectrum between types of midstream assets. But I'm just wondering sort of, as a complex, if there has been any impact or as long as VLP is over 10x EBITDA, the dropdown values can stay at 10x EBITDA and there is no real problem.","John Locke","We haven't seen any change in drop down multiples of the deals that have been occurring here recently. So they're still at roughly 12% pre-tax for VLP.","Operator","The next question comes from Mohit Bhardwaj from Citigroup.","Mohit Bhardwaj","The question is on ethanol. You guys just talked about ethanol market in 2015, obviously in 2014 ethanol was a big support and you guys made like $700 million to $800 million in operating margin. Moving to 2015 it looks like the corn prices have kind of held up and ethanol prices are coming down based on the global economics, maybe just talk about that?","Martin Parrish","Ethanol margins are likely to remain low in the $50 crude environment. And we don't know how long crude is going to stay at these prices obviously. What we do know is we have the best assets in the ethanol industry in the U.S. and we're in an advantaged location and we know we're not marginal producer. So we expect to weather this time.","Mohit Bhardwaj","And market do you expect to remain in the positive territory or do you think right now you're seeing negative markets in that?","Martin Parrish","I think it's going to chop around some, but we think overall it will be positive with our fleet.","Joseph Gorder","And it's positive today, yes.","Mohit Bhardwaj","And you guys mentioned crude-by-rail to California, it looks [indiscernible]. Is Port Arthur and St. Charles will be utilizing the rail side or you guys have just been looking at getting heavy cars from Latin America.","Richard Lashway","So your question is -- can you restate your question?","Mohit Bhardwaj","I was just wondering if economics for crude-by-rail into Port Arthur and St. Charles for heavy Canadian are still working out or is it more profitability to just look for opportunities for Latin American heavy metals right now.","Richard Lashway","So I would tell you today that barrels that we're bringing to Port Arthur with today's economics would be breakeven versus on my alternative with where the market is today.","Mohit Bhardwaj","And final one from me, just looking at California, the American [indiscernible] and talk about California models improving for them. And California remains the only place where the market has got a lot [indiscernible] value. Are there opportunities as you see to improve margins there?","Joseph Gorder","To improve margins in California?","Lane Riggs","The only project that we're working on really besides our ongoing optimization efforts, and maybe a real small thing is the crude-by-rail. We believe in the optionality available for us crude from the Mid-Continent ultimately, and because our views, the West Coast is a very challenging environment. We are very careful and very disciplined in how we approach capital into the West Coast versus all our opportunities we have elsewhere in our operations.","Operator","The next question comes from Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Ed Westlake","Congratulations on the earnings. I guess, last year we were talking about LLS, and this year we're just talking about all round good performance and margin capture, so well done. One of the, I guess, opening comments you made was, it was attributable to great performance from the hydrocrackers. Obviously, oil has fallen further and that's just sort of a swirl, and then obviously mentioned that diesel demand is a bit weaker, partly due to weather. I mean, presumably some of that will give back, although obviously take the point that the crude market part of it could still be an area of positive surprise. Just some thoughts there.","Lane Riggs","We have a pretty good slide in our IR presentation on how the hydrocracker performed and sensitivities around it. We have sort of basic set of economics on the 2014 price stat. With that said, yes, oil price have fallen and the distillate crack is where it is, but natural gas prices have fallen as well. But I think when you look at it, when you look at these drivers, you just need to take all that in consideration. Today, we still have very good margins on the hydrocrackers.","Ed Westlake","And was there any wholesale benefit? I mean, obviously, I guess racks in 4Q crude could fell?","Lane Riggs","Yes. We did see a benefit on the wholesale side. The rack prices tend to lag a little bit. And so we had very good rack margins through the fourth quarter.","Ed Westlake","I mean is there a way to quantify in dollar millions, I mean just obviously trying to get to sort of a sense of a more steady state level of earnings, appreciate there's lots of volatility in the fourth quarter and still today?","Lane Riggs","I don't have those numbers.","Ed Westlake","Any volumes of wholesale products, which perhaps because that stuff which you can sell over the rack where the wholesale margin may not have expanded as much, and then there are other parts to be U.S., I'm thinking, some of these states which don't have refining, where you'd imagine that there would be a greater sensitivity to wholesale. I mean any sort of overall number for production that is sold in rack prices, which is a price to the positive?","Joseph Gorder","Well, I mean our wholesale business really consist of I would say several different types of businesses. We've got the branded wholesale business. We've got the unbranded contract business. We've got our national accounts business. And then we've got spot wholesale business. And all of that is volume that's moved across the rack.","Ed, we don't have a problem talking about it, but quite honestly the income associated with the wholesale business is embedded right now in the way we report our refinery operations. And the volume and the margins on the wholesale business are so much smaller than we would have, if you look at the refining margin, it's just doesn't makes sense to break it out before. And it also tends to vary so much. So I would tell you, if you want we can talk about this a little bit offline, but I don't think it's going to have a material impact to your forecasting going forward.","Ed Westlake","I was just trying to check, when you have surprises like this, you're trying to work out where they came from?","Joseph Gorder","Sure. I understand, but I would tell you that maybe it was a good quarter for wholesale, but it wasn't something that material affected the numbers that we reported.","Ed Westlake","And then just a tad theory of mine. We're all driving F150s to Disney World this summer. I'm driving from New York it's a long way, I might even take the F350 on the road. How do you think the industry is going to be prepared to make the summer-grade gasoline given that we probably haven't have this type of market for sometime. Maybe just give us a color on any constraints that you see in making summer-grade gasoline or not, just a view?","Joseph Gorder","I don't see any thing where I would tell you that we'll have any constraints on being able to produce the gasoline for the summer time market.","Ed Westlake","So it should just be a normal seasonal trade as we switch out from winter to summer, but nothing exceptional in your view?","Joseph Gorder","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.","Neil Mehta","Joe, just as a follow-up from a conversation of couple of months ago, obviously Brent TI is tighter. So we're inside this export arbitrage, but now in 2015 the politics Washington are a little bit different. Wanted to get your temperature on the discussion around the crude export band and what discussions in Washington feel like around that right now?","Joseph Gorder","That's a good question. I mean we maintain our position that we're totally supportive of free and open markets. If the crude export ban were lifted, we believe that Congress is going to address this and needs to address it, and the other issues associated with this as well such as the Jones Act, cross-border pipelines in the RFS, that's been our position and I think that we continue to believe that.","It's hard to pick one particular issue and focus attention on that without looking at the overall energy policy that we have here in the U.S. in aggregate. So we talked to our government relations guys all the time. We know that there is a lot of conversation taking place around crude oil exports, but we're not seeing it being promoted in any kind of material way at this point in time.","Now, if you go to the practical side of this, we are still importers of crude in the United States. We import significant volumes, probably still 4.5 millions barrels per day, and that's not from Canada. There is additional volumes that are coming from Canada. So you've got crude that's being brought into the country.","You've got at market right now that is putting downward pressure on crude prices, and you ultimately will get to who's got the lowest cost to produce to determine who is going to be continuing to produce and provide the supply. So I, honestly, am not sure where you would see domestically produced crude being exported today as it's trying to find its way through refining capacity globally. So issues flare up and then they tend to calm down a little bit. This one is still getting some conversations, but I don't think our perspective has changed from what we've talked about historically.","Neil Mehta","The other question is around Brent WTI just separately. You made the comment that you think they has the potential to widen out here over the next couple of months. What's driven the widening over the last couple of weeks? What do you guys see in Cushing happening? And then as you think about where that widening could occur, is it on the TI LLS piece of the equation or is it Brent LLS?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So I would say the team has driven the Brent TI wide, as if you look at the DOE stats over the last two weeks, we had two very large crude bills. So it kind of starts to tell you that as the Saudi start forcing more medium sour barrels into the market, it displays that some of this like light sweetening will begin to light sweet. And as inventory is build then it means we need to wider for EIR in order to start the incentiving refineries to take that light barrel back into the market.","So I think that's what's happened. I do think it will get wider to the point where we are incentivized to go back to light sweet. And I would tell you that I would expect that the Brent TI could be a little bit wider and part of that is also due to the fact that we're building all this inventory in Cushing, and so maybe the Brent TI is a little bit wider than the LLS to Brent Spread.","Operator","The next question comes Chi Chow from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Chi Chow","Just a couple of follow-ups there. I guess this is a really question for the second half of year. With the Line 9 reversal, what sort of volumes do you have committed on that line and what sorts of crudes are you expecting to move on? Is it Bakken or Syncrude or some other Canadian barrel?","Joseph Gorder","So I don't think we've talked about our line commitment is. What we've said is when Line 9 comes up, we'll be able to completely supply the Quebec refinery with North American domestic barrels. In terms of the quality of crude, we would expect to ship. About 50% of the volume we ship would be a synthetic-type barrel and the other mix of other Canadian light sweet Bakken.","Chi Chow","And do those crudes, when you bring them in, are they going to change the yield at all or are they going increase the possibility from product standpoint on yields and volumes.","Joseph Gorder","So what we would say is with the change in diet, the crudes that we anticipate getting off Line 9 tend to be a higher distillate yield crude. And so we do show that they have a margin advantage as long as distillate is over gasoline compared to some of the West African grades that we run today, which tend to be a higher gasoline yield crude.","Chi Chow","And then a couple of questions just for Mike. I guess, you've got to couple of debt maturities this year, what's the timing of those? And secondly, how do you think about sort of a minimum cash balance that you're comfortable operating at.","Michael Ciskowski","The timings, there's 400 is due next week. I believe it is. And then we have 75 that's couple of months later is on the timing. And what was the second question?","Chi Chow","Just how you think about minimum cash balance? What sort of minimum levels are you comfortable operating at?","Michael Ciskowski","I mean we really don't have a minimum cash balance identified, but when you look at our operations, I think, we are comfortable in the range of around $2 billion.","End of Q&A","Operator","At this moment, we show no further questions. I will like to turn the meeting over to you for any closing remarks.","Joseph Gorder","Thank you, Hilda. We appreciate everyone calling in and those listening today. If you have additional questions please contact our IR department. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. We thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2018s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Homer Bhullar. Thank you. Please go ahead sir.","Homer Bhullar","Good morning everyone and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Donna Titzman, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and several other members of Valero\u2019s senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company\u2019s or management\u2019s expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations including those we\u2019ve described in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.","Joseph Gorder","Thanks Homer and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report that we had a good quarter delivering solid financial results. Our refineries operated well at 96% utilization allowing us to take advantage of wider sour crude oil differentials and weakness in high sulfur residual feedstocks.","Overall, 2019 was a challenging environment for the refining business. We started the year with gasoline inventories at record highs and gasoline cracks at historic lows. We were also faced with narrow sour crude oil differentials for most of the year, primarily due to sanctions on Venezuela and Iran in addition to OPEC and Canadian crude oil production curtailments.","And differentials on inland sweet crude oils narrowed in the second half of the year with the start-up of multiple new crude pipelines from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast.","Despite this challenging backdrop, our team demonstrated the strength of our assets and prior investments to improve our feedstock and product flexibility allowing us to deliver another year of steady earnings and free cash flow.","We demonstrated our crude supply flexibility by processing an annual record of 1.4 million barrels per day of North American sweet crude oil as well as a record of approximately 180,000 barrels per day of Canadian heavy crude oil in 2019.","We also achieved another milestone by delivering the best ever year on employee safety performance and the lowest number of environmental events in company history, demonstrating our strong commitment to safety, reliability and environmental stewardship.","We continue to invest in projects that enhance the flexibility and margin capability of our portfolio. In 2019, we successfully started up the Houston alkylation unit and completed the Central Texas Pipelines and Terminals Project.","And we have several growth projects that will be completed this year including the Pasadena terminal, St. Charles alkylation units and the Pembroke cogeneration unit. Looking further out, the Diamond pipeline expansion should be completed in 2021 and the Diamond Green Diesel and the Port Arthur Coker projects are still on track to be completed in 2021 and 2022, respectively.","We also continue to explore growth opportunities in our renewable fuels business, which is already the largest in North America. As we previously announced, the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture is in the advanced engineering review phase for a new renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur, Texas facility. If the project is approved, operations are expected to commence in 2024, which will result in Diamond Green Diesel\u2019s renewable fuels production capacity increasing to over 1.1 billion gallons annually or over 70,000 barrels per day.","We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, a constant in our strategy for several years, which prioritizes our investment grade credit rating, sustaining investments and maintaining a sustainable and growing dividend.","We expect our annual CapEx for 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion, which is consistent with our average annual spend over the last six years with approximately $1 billion allocated for high return growth projects that are focused on market expansion and margin improvement and the balance allocated to maintain safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operations.","And you should continue to expect incremental discretionary cash flow to compete with other discretionary uses including organic growth investments, M&A and cash returns to our investors. Looking ahead, we have a favorable outlook for refining margins with the IMO 2020 low sulfur fuel oil regulation, which just took effect on January 1.","High sulfur crude oils are expected to be more discounted due to lower demand as less complex refineries switched to sweeter crude oils. Valero\u2019s complex refining system is well positioned to take advantage of the discounted high sulfur crudes and fuel oils as feedstocks. And our growing renewable diesel segment continues to generate strong results due to the high demand for renewable fuels.","In closing, our incredible team\u2019s relentless focus on operational excellence, a steady pipeline of high-return organic growth projects and a demonstrated commitment to shareholder returns should continue to position Valero well.","So with that Homer, I\u2019ll hand the call back to you.","Homer Bhullar","Thanks, Joe. For the fourth quarter of 2019, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $1.1 billion or $2.58 per share compared to $952 million or $2.24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Fourth quarter 2019 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $873 million or $2.13 per share compared to $932 million or $2.19 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018.","For 2019, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.4 billion or $5.84 per share compared to $3.1 billion or $7.29 per share in 2018. 2019 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $2.4 billion or $5.70 per share compared to $3.2 billion or $7.55 per share in 2018.","The 2018 and 2019 adjusted results exclude several items reflected in the financial tables that accompany the earnings release. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to those financial tables.","Operating income for the refining segment in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018. Refining throughput volumes averaged three million barrels per day, which was in line with the fourth quarter of 2018.","Throughput capacity utilization was 96% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.93 per barrel were in line with the fourth quarter of 2018. The ethanol segment generated $36 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a $27 million operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2018.","The increase from the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily due to higher margins resulting from higher ethanol prices. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.3 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2019.","Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was $541 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $101 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. After adjusting for the retroactive blenders tax credit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, adjusted renewable diesel operating income was $187 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $167 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales volume.","Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 844,000 gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of 124,000 gallons per day versus the fourth quarter of 2018. For the fourth quarter of 2019, general and administrative expenses were $243 million and net interest expense was $119 million.","General and administrative expenses for 2019 of $868 million were lower than 2018, mainly due to adjustments to our environmental liabilities in 2018.","For the fourth quarter of 2019, depreciation and amortization expense was $571 million and income tax expense was $326 million. The effective tax rate was 20% for 2019. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019.","Excluding the unfavorable impact from the change in working capital of $434 million and our joint venture partner\u2019s 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel\u2019s net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changing in its working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion.","With regard to investing activities, we made $722 million of capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2019 of which approximately $445 million was for sustaining the business including cost for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance. For 2019, we invested $2.7 billion, which includes all of Diamond Green Diesel\u2019s capital investments of $160 million.","Excluding our partner\u2019s 50% share of Diamond Green Diesel\u2019s capital investments, Valero\u2019s capital investments for 2019 were approximately $2.6 billion with approximately $1 billion of the total for growing the business.","Moving to financing activities. We returned $591 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter. $369 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 2.3 million shares of Valero common stock. This brings our 2019 return to stockholders to $2.3 billion and the total payout ratio to 47% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities.","As of December 31, we had approximately $1.5 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. And last week, our Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.98 per share, or $3.92 per share annually further demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our investors.","With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end, total debt was $9.7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $2.6 billion. Valero\u2019s debt to capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 26%. At the end of December, we had $5.3 billion of available liquidity excluding cash.","Turning to guidance. We continue to expect annual capital investments for 2020 to be approximately $2.5 billion, with approximately 60% allocated to sustaining the business and approximately 40% to growth. The $2.5 billion includes expenditures for turnarounds catalysts and joint venture investments.","For modeling, our first quarter operations we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.63 million to 1.68 million barrels per day; U.S. mid-continent at 410,000 to 430,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 230,000 to 250,000 barrels per day, and North Atlantic at 470,000 to 490,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.15 per barrel.","Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4.2 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. With respect to renewable diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be 750,000 gallons per day in 2020.","Operating expenses in 2020 should be $0.50 per gallon, which includes $0.20 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $113 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $560 million.","For 2020, we expect G&A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately $860 million. The annual effective tax rate is estimated at 22%. Lastly, we expect RINs expense for the year to be between $300 million and $400 million.","That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits. This helps us ensure other callers have time to answer questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Phil Gresh","Hey. Good morning.","Joseph Gorder","Good morning, Phil.","Phil Gresh","So first question two part question. I was wondering, if you could discuss in the fourth quarter what incremental actions Valero took in order to run more fuel oil as a feedstock across the portfolio? And how much of that you\u2019re actually able to capture in the quarter? As well as why you think the high sulfur fuel oil prices have started to strengthen here in the beginning of 2020?","Lane Riggs","Hey, Phil, it\u2019s Lane. I\u2019ll start with - in terms of how we may be looked at our operating conditions and our operating envelope and then Gary can sort of finish up with the market. On the operating condition, we widened our window - our operating window to try to reach out and get more challenging high sulfur resid.","We always - we\u2019ve for years and years and years really for decade, we\u2019ve been somebody who buys a lot of high sulfur resid to run, but we opened up to market [indiscernible] we believe the idea was - as the market changed and try to conform or at least to the IMO 2020 to some of these high sulfur resid would free up in the marketplace. And so we - and we want to get it the resid before it gets blended into the high sulfur fuel oil market because of quality reasons. So, that\u2019s really what we did. We reached out and ran quite a few high sulfur resid that we have not historically ran.","Gary Simmons","Yes. So, the second part of that in terms of I guess - how much of it showed up in the fourth quarter. We ran a lot of high sulfur resid, but we really didn\u2019t see the discounted barrels coming in until about mid-December. So, it didn\u2019t have a real significant impact on fourth quarter results and you\u2019ll see that more going forward. But in terms of high sulfur fuel getting more expensive, it\u2019s -- we\u2019re still in the very early phase of what\u2019s a significant transition in our industry as we respond to the IMO bunkers sulfur spec change.","And so with a change of the magnitude, you would expect it to create some volatility in the markets and it will take some time for the markets to reach equilibrium. So, we certainly see that there\u2019s not a lot of liquidity in the physical fuel oil markets we - there\u2019s a lot more liquidity in the paper markets.","If you look at the forward curve steeply backwardated and kind of showing fuel gets back to 60%, 65% of Brent which is kind of more where we think it will be. So, our view really in respect to high sulfur fuel oil and the crude oil quality discounts hasn\u2019t changed. As the markets normalize, we expect to see the discount widen back out as the forward curve reflects, and as high sulfur fuel blend stocks have to compete for space with heavy sour crudes and complex refining capacity like we have in the Gulf Coast.","Phil Gresh","Okay. Got it. Thank you. The second question just on the capital allocation side of things. You continue to keep capital spending flattish here in 2020 and you had a really healthy dividend increase that you just announced which looks pretty well covered by cash flow. So, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about this increase in the dividend?","And is it just a shift from the dividend to the buyback and you\u2019re sticking with the same constructs that you\u2019ve had 40% to 50% of cash flow? And obviously, the buyback will reduce the dividend burden over time, but just curious how you\u2019re thinking about all this today. Thanks.","Donna Titzman","No, we haven\u2019t changed our policy and it continues to be that we want to return 40% to 50% of the cash flow from operations to the shareholders. The dividend increase is just a part of that payout. We don\u2019t have anything particular in mind in regards to the dividend only payout. It\u2019s just part of the overall cash return.","You might see that dividend as a percentage of the total vary each year as our cash flow varies, but buybacks will continue to fill in the balance of that return.","Phil Gresh","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Manav Gupta","Joe, could you talk a little bit about the Gulf Coast operating results, you were almost up 75% on operating income on the Gulf Coast. And the context I\u2019m trying to understand this is like you have global majors one of which indicated that downstream earnings could be down 80% quarter-over-quarter. Another one reported today downstream earnings down 36%. How is Valero in an alternate universe that you are so much better than others?","Joseph Gorder","Manav, that\u2019s a really good question and I\u2019d love to give you an intelligent answer, but why don\u2019t I get one of these guys cover it here. Gary, Lane.","Lane Riggs","Yeah. So Manav, which - I mean first of all, we did higher discounts crude oil discounts and obviously the resid discount in the fourth quarter. So if you\u2019re comparing third quarter to the fourth quarter that\u2019s part of the answer.","The second part of the answer is we got better naphtha - better naphtha netbacks because naphtha price has improved over the quarter. And again, we also [indiscernible] butane. So butane when you compare fourth quarter to third quarter is our ability to run cheaper butane or at least blended obviously helped us with our capture rate when compared to the third quarter.","Manav Gupta","A quick follow-up on the renewable diesel and the expansion of targeted for late 2021. You guys have indicated a normalized margin of only 125 versus 180 or something you realized in this quarter without BTC. But if you put the basic even 125, you could get like $250 million EBITDA on the base margin and then about another $140 million.","So you\u2019re looking at a return of like $390 million of EBITDA on this project. So from your capital expenditure point of $550 million, it looks like a two-year payback on this entire project? Like is the math right or is something off here?","Martin Parrish","We feel pretty good about it, Manav. This is Martin Parrish. We still feel good about the pro forma guidance of the $126 million. That excludes the blender\u2019s tax credit. So that puts you at $2.26 per gallon EBITDA. I think that kind of checks out with what you\u2019re saying.","Manav Gupta","Thanks, guys.","Martin Parrish","Thanks.","Joseph Gorder","Yes. So Manav, you\u2019re very close.","Manav Gupta","Thank you.","Joseph Gorder","You bet. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate","Hey, good morning guys. Joe I think this is the first time we\u2019ve spoken this year so happy New Year.","Joseph Gorder","Thank you. Same to you Doug.","Doug Leggate","Joe, I got one on the market and one on Valero. Let\u2019s go with Valero first. Maybe Donna wants to take this. But Phil already asked about the payout, the 40%, 50% of your cash flow payout. I guess I\u2019m more curious on the mix with the dividend. I mean you were very early to get on this trend of returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders and it\u2019s paid part in the fund.","But it has paid dividends in both the credibility of the business model as well as the relative performance of the stock, but why not more dividends over buybacks? I\u2019m just curious how you think about that?","Joseph Gorder","Do you want to take it crack at it? ","Donna Titzman","Sure. So look we have told - we\u2019ve explained to the market that we do consider that dividend to be part of the nondiscretionary piece of our capital allocation. So when we look at that we look at it in the context of it being [attentive] [ph] to the market with our peers and the market in general, but also more importantly sustainable through market cycles. So again, we regularly review that with those objectives in mind.","Joseph Gorder","Doug, what I would - and Donna is exactly right. What I would add to what she said, you\u2019ve got the sustainability aspect in a down market cycle which is something that we spend a lot of time looking at to be sure that we don\u2019t find ourselves cutting the dividend. And you reinforce that by having a very strong balance sheet.","But if I think about it longer-term, okay, and this is really where my brain goes, it goes to the sustainability of the growth of the dividend going forward. And we want to continue to be able to grow.","We want to give our owners more every year. And the way that you go about doing that is tempering it a little bit. I think we started talking last year about moderating the dividend a little bit more, which I think you saw we did this year.","And the other thing that\u2019s really encouraging from my perspective is it, we\u2019ve got these capital projects that are coming on stream. They are providing significant future earnings potential. And some of them are longer cash flow cycles, which we haven\u2019t done a lot over the last bunch of years, but I mean, we got another renewable diesel plant, we\u2019ve got the Coker.","And then if we end up doing the Port Arthur renewable diesel plant in the future. These are huge EBITDA producing projects, which are going to really reinforce our ability to go ahead and continue to deliver dividend growth going forward.","Now, I\u2019m not making you a promise, because Lord only knows what might happen, but that would be our objective. And that\u2019s kind of the way we look at investing our capital.","The component part, the percentage of the total payout that\u2019s made up of the dividend, that the dividend comprises, that\u2019s not formulaic. It\u2019s more us looking at all of the factors involved. And there\u2019s a lot of sausage-making that takes place there that we won\u2019t get into here.","But I always want to be in a position when we do something like this to let you know that we feel fairly assured that this isn\u2019t going to be an issue going forward.","Doug Leggate","I appreciate the lengthy answer guys. My follow-up Joe, I don\u2019t know if you want to throw this to one of the guys, and may I also offer my congratulations to the new officers titles in the team. But maybe Lane want to take this. But there\u2019s a lot of chatter about new capacity coming online in back end of this year and maybe for the next couple of years.","Obviously, things are kind of soft, it seems on the demand side given what\u2019s going on with China. But I\u2019m just wondering how you see the prognosis for the short-term IMO tailwinds transitioning maybe into a more challenging refining environment longer term? Are you guys thinking about that? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Joseph Gorder","Thanks, Doug.","Lane Riggs","Yeah. So I think for at least next year to two years, we see global oil demand growth kind of keeping pace with the capacity additions and we still think we have favorable balances between production and consumption.","But then yeah, we start to show two to three years out that capacity additions start to outpace global oil demand growth. And at that time, we would expect to see some rationalization in the industry.","Doug Leggate","So the next couple of years you\u2019re not concerned about -- I mean, obviously, Amoco has got a bunch of stuff coming online and then Asia kicks up 21, 22 so you\u2019re not concerned about the short that kind of medium-term outlook then?","Lane Riggs","No. We still show that oil demand growth outpaces capacity addition for the short term.","Doug Leggate","Okay. We\u2019ll watch this. I\u2019ll watch with interest guys and looking forward to seeing you in March at our conference. Thanks.","Joseph Gorder","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your line is now open.","Paul Sankey","Good morning, all. If I could sort of follow-up on that. Hi, guys. Joe, you ran higher than we expected in every region. Could you talk about them and that\u2019s obviously versus your guidance. Could you talk about the pattern of higher volume? I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a volume mass issue there. But certainly your capture suggests that\u2019s not the right direction to be looking in.","And furthermore once you\u2019ve hopefully helped explain how come you\u2019re running at the levels that you are right across the system, could you - and this is a follow-up to the previous question. Could you talk about any expectations you have for shutdowns in refining if margins stay extremely weak and potentially get worse with this whole situation in China? Thanks.","Joseph Gorder","Okay. So, Paul we\u2019ll look - we\u2019re kind of looking at each other let us give -- take a crack at this and then we\u2019ll give you the opportunity if we\u2019re not answering your question to follow-up. Okay.","Lane Riggs","Hey, Paul. This is Lane. I\u2019ll start. We\u2019ve had a long strategy really dating back to 2011 to work in a very organized way on our reliability projects and what we\u2019ve seen is our refining system has gone from say 95% to 96% availability all the way up to sort of over 97% availability and that\u2019s helped us. We\u2019re available when the market\u2019s right and been able to perform better.","And in addition to that we do believe that we\u2019re the best in the industry in terms of understanding what feedstocks go where in the systems that we\u2019re in and we\u2019re highly adaptable to that. So, I think that helps us versus some other people in terms of our capture rates.","Paul Sankey","Lane could you just dig in a little bit on that better than anyone else arguing because to an extent I guess the computer programs commoditized or not? If you could just go a bit down that that would be grateful. Thanks.","Lane Riggs","It\u2019s interesting you would say they\u2019re commoditized because everybody have tools. Everybody believes that they\u2019re all implementing these tools and to some degree or another. I would say that I believe we are more integrated and more aligned on making sure that our tools are characterized the fees and we understand our units very well.","It\u2019s one thing to have the tool. Sometimes people have tools, but they don\u2019t use the tools. We have a world-class planning and economics group when they do a fantastic job coordinating with our refineries in terms of having those sub models very well understood. Therefore we understand the operating envelopes and how those feedstocks are characterized in our systems.","Paul Sankey","Yes. I mean I guess further to a previous question, we\u2019ve seen big mega oil so you would think have a similar structure in terms of the refining footprint to you guys wildly underperforming against what you guys are achieving. So, it\u2019s just interesting to try and establish what the competitive advantage is.","Joseph Gorder","Well, we appreciate you saying that Paul.","Lane Riggs","Yes, thank you.","Joseph Gorder","And then the follow-up question was on capacity?","Lane Riggs","Yes. So, I think the situation in the Far East is just developing. And it\u2019s really too early for us to be able to judge the magnitude of the impact that\u2019s going to have and whether it leads to refinery shutting down or not.","Joseph Gorder","The reality of it is we\u2019ve got capacity coming on stream. We\u2019ve also got capacity that isn\u2019t running well and that in the foreseeable future probably won\u2019t be able to run well. And so - and Paul if you assume at some point it\u2019s a zero-sum game, there\u2019s going to be a lot of capacity that shouldn\u2019t run.","Certainly - and I have a post-IMO world it\u2019s going to have an effect on that. And so if you got poorly performing assets today, turning them around is a lengthy process. And then if you\u2019ve got a marginal asset due to economics, you\u2019re going to be the guy that has to bow at some point in time.","So that\u2019s why we look at it. I mean frankly our tendency is to focus a whole lot more on our business and what we can do to make it better and more efficient than kind of what\u2019s happening more broadly.","Paul Sankey","Yes, got it. If I could just ask a very specific follow-up. If we assume that there was extreme weakness in jet fuel demand what would that mean for you and the global industry? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Lane Riggs","Okay. Thanks. Chris [ph] our jet yield is about 8%. So we make 200,000, 250,000 barrels a day of jet. Some of that is contract demand and inland demand which is going to stay but a lot of it in our Gulf Coast refineries we have the ability to put that into diesel, if jet demand got soft and I suspect that\u2019s what would happen.","Paul Sankey","Thank you.","Lane Riggs","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Sam Margolin","Hello, how are you?","Joseph Gorder","Very good, Sam.","Sam Margolin","I know you just said you focus on your own business and not the market but I have a market question to start.","Joseph Gorder","I didn\u2019t say we don\u2019t focus on the market.","Sam Margolin","So a lot of attention is being paid to this collapse in diesel cracks. Part of the reason that the drop has been so pronounced just because the peak that it started from was so high. And at the time when we were at that peak, it seemed obvious why but in retrospect IMO is having more of a feedstock effect than a product effect.","So do you have any updated thoughts about that period just three months ago when diesel cracks were peaking in retrospect. What was really driving that? And maybe that will help inform how we can escape this headwind in the intermediate term?","Joseph Gorder","Yes, Sam. So I think as we got to the back half of the fourth quarter, obviously fall turnaround season winded down and we started to see refinery utilization ramp up and with higher refinery utilization of course distillate production increased.","And then overall, demand has been weaker than what we anticipated. So a lot of that\u2019s been due to warmer weather. The warmer weather is somewhat offset, a lot of the demand increase we thought we would get as a result of IMO.","In addition to that, certainly in the U.S. Gulf Coast we\u2019ve had a very heavy fog, which has limited our ability to export the diesel to some of the export markets. In addition to that we\u2019ve had very high freight rates, which again hinder our ability to export. Of course, South America is a big export market for us. They\u2019ve had a lot of rain in South America, which has delayed the harvest. So again having a hit to demand.","And then I think the final thing is there was a lot of pre stocking of very low sulfur fuel oil that happened in the industry. And so, so far it\u2019s muted the impact that IMO will have. We certainly are confident that that demand will show up but it would be more of a second quarter type demand increase than what we\u2019re seeing so far in the first quarter.","Sam Margolin","Okay. Thanks. And my follow-ups on renewable diesel. It\u2019s been said on this call already the economics are really strong it scales very accretively. On the feedstock side, are there any constraints as you imagine this business getting bigger?","There was another operator in the business who recently pivoted a little bit on the feedstock side and said tightening was possible in the future. Do you see any of that? Or is your \u2013 does the strength of your partnership with Diamond kind of help you avoid that friction?","Joseph Gorder","Well definitely the strength of our partnership with Diamond helps us. They processed 10% of the world\u2019s meat byproducts. So we\u2019re in a unique position with the JV we have. Feedstock is tied to GDP growth per capita and that\u2019s growing in the world. So it\u2019s going to tighten up some but we still feel good about being able to source it and we don\u2019t see that as a constraint with what we\u2019ve talked about so far.","Sam Margolin","All right. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.","Paul Cheng","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Joseph Gorder","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng","I think that the first one is probably either for Lane or Gary. You guys historically won the M-100; I suppose that directly for the crude unit. Have you tested or whether that you will be - have the configuration to one - the high sulfur directly through the quarter. And that if you do that - how big is that capacity you may be able to do here? And also whether you have export any low in the fourth quarter?","Lane Riggs","Hey Paul this is Lane. I\u2019ll start and Gary can round me up. As you alluded to, we have a history running in 100, but not all in 100 are created equal. There\u2019s varying quality. We had a - what we would consider to be a quality window that we\u2019ve historically ran. We\u2019ve widened out. We do run -- we run those types of long resid. They obviously have a little bit of cutter stock and we typically run them in our crude supply.","And so as we raise the percentages of them, you think about well, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re running to fill to the resid and obviously it makes buildout the bottom of the refiner. And then we\u2019re running fleet crude as a supplement to that, because that\u2019s been an advantaged crude really for the past year.","So, it\u2019s really over time we were optimizing by looking at all the domestic light with these resids opening the call the operating envelope for all the resids that we can find in the world. And then we are constantly optimizing that versus the heavy sour crude availability.","And that\u2019s kind of how we always run. We\u2019ve just -- we\u2019ve worked really hard to characterize some of these that are new to the market and are trying to run more of them. So, what was your second question?","Paul Cheng","No, I mean the first one have you export any no sulfur resid?","Lane Riggs","Yes. So, our economic signals have been to low sulfur out of the cat crackers. And we did sell quite a bit of it in the fourth quarter and so far in the first quarter we\u2019re seeing the same economic signals","Joseph Gorder","In addition to that we\u2019re - so Paul in addition to that we\u2019re also exporting a lot of low sulfur ATV that we normally run in our as well.","Paul Cheng","What kind of economic and how much you have export? I mean is that part of the reason why your margin has been perhaps the better than people thought?","Joseph Gorder","Yes. I mean we were selling those particularly low sulfur ATVs and some of the other hydro process resid quite a bit above obviously quite a bit above what they historically been worth?","Paul Cheng","Yes. And is there a volume that you can share? Is it say 50,000 barrel per day 100,000 barrel per day, any kind of rough number?","Joseph Gorder","No, we probably don\u2019t really want to share that.","Paul Cheng","Okay. Final one you run 180,000 barrel per day of the WCS. Is there any more room that you would be able to expand that?","Joseph Gorder","Yes there is. So, we have -- we primarily run the Canadian at Port Arthur in Texas City. We can also take it to St. Charles and we have plenty of capacity to run more Canadian.","Paul Cheng","How about supply? Can you get it there?","Joseph Gorder","Yes, we can. So, today a lot of the problem is certainly pipelines coming out of Western Canada are full but we buy out the pipeline and we also continue to take volume by rail. So I think in the fourth quarter we did a little below 38000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian by rail. We\u2019re seeing those volumes ramp up in the first quarter and expect them to ramp up even more in the second quarter.","Paul Cheng","Perfect. Thank you.","Joseph Gorder","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Neil Mehta","Good morning and let me add my\u2026","Joseph Gorder","Good morning, Neil.","Neil Mehta","Lane and Gary here on the promotions. I guess my first question is we spend a lot more time than we ever have with investors on the issue of sustainability in carbon intensity. And it\u2019s really the side of the ESG. And Joe maybe you could just talk high level how you think about Valero\u2019s framework for talking to investors about ESG and carbon intensity.","Do you feel like you\u2019re there where you want to be on carbon targets and disclosure and then I would think the renewable diesel business becomes a big part of the narrative of how you respond to any difference that might emerge around?","Joseph Gorder","Yes. No, Neil that\u2019s a really good question. And you are right. We do spend a lot of time on this. And frankly I think Valero\u2019s got a great story. Jason is responsible and John are jointly responsible for our efforts around this. And we made a lot of progress. And I\u2019ll let those two guys speak to this in some detail.","Jason Fraser","Yes, this is Jason. Neil I\u2019ll be glad to talk to you a little bit about it. And as you \u2013 the point you made about strategy is of course, correct. Two of our three segments are now renewable. We\u2019re largest renewable diesel producer in the U.S. through DDD second largest producer of ethanol and we continue to look at that area and expand it as we\u2019ve discussed.","And we\u2019re also looking at other low carbon fuels and ways to lower our carbon intense our existing business. So it has a business footprint. I think we\u2019ve been evolving to as the market expectations have changed. I think you\u2019ve done a job on that side.","On the environment side, we\u2019re very mindful about environmental impact. We\u2019ve always been proud of our record. In 2019 we had our best ever performance on our environmental scorecard events is the lowest number we\u2019ve ever had and it\u2019s safety has always been a big focus of ours. In 2019, our refining employee NGL rate was our best ever and the combined employee contractor rate was our second lowest in company history.","We think we have a good governance structure. 10 of our 11 directors are independent. We have substantial diversity is something we\u2019re always working on. We have really good risk oversight, risk management within our governance structure.","And then on the disclosure area which is one of the things you asked about, we\u2019ve definitely beefed it up here in the last couple of years as we put more focus on the ESG area. In September 2018, we published our report on climate-related risks and opportunities.","And we prepared that in alignment with the TCFD recommendations which seems to be more and more \u2013 our investors seem to be a coalescent around that as being the standard they want. There are a lot of competing regimes out there.","So just good to see some standardization kind of come into play. And they were also putting out a stewardship and responsibility report annually where we talk about some about the carbon stuff but also about other sustainability-oriented areas and we\u2019re continuing to work on that every year to try to make us better.","And I know there\u2019s been some large investors focusing on SaaS year as being maybe the standard. And once again outside of carbon there\u2019s been a lot of variability in different disclosure structures and what people may want.","So we\u2019re taking a hard look at SaaS this year and comparing to what we\u2019re doing to see if we need to tweak some things there are always looking to improve.","Neil Mehta","Right. Appreciate it. And then the follow-up question actually relates to RINs, which I know is collectively our least favorite topic. But there were some headlines recently around the court cases around RINs exemptions and a small waiver, the waivers for some of the smaller refiners from a couple of years ago. Do you see any risk that this becomes an issue that could put upward price pressure on RINs again?","Joseph Gorder","Go ahead.","Jason Fraser","Okay. Yeah this is Jason again. We did see that in out of case of the Denver last week. And what it did was vacated SREs for three refineries, two of all the frontiers and one of CVRs. And the EPA has several options, including appeal, expect they will probably will appeal, like neither appeal and have the Tenth Circuit that - hear the case as a whole or go straight to the Supreme Court and we know they\u2019re evaluating their options to see.","So court took a reading of the statute a fairly constrained view that as far as I know has been done by court in the past but it\u2019s definitely not in keeping with the view the judge had at the way they\u2019ve interpreted the statute in the past. So we really have to see what the judge does with it to get an idea of how impactful this is.","One important point is because it was at the circuit of the DC circuit, which is a decision the clients made and when they filed it, it\u2019s only has legal effect within the circuit. So it only binds the EPA within those six states that are covered by the DC circuit. So let\u2019s see how it evolves.","Joseph Gorder","Yeah, we\u2019ll see how it plays out. It\u2019s probably too early to give a market signal on RINs prices as a result of this case really.","Neil Mehta","Great, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Theresa Chen","Good morning. Joe, I\u2019d like to touch on your comments earlier about Permian pipes to Gulf Coast and narrowing of inland. And as far as developments at Corpus Christi goes there\u2019s been continued discussion on potential stock constraints in the area. And based on one of your competitors\u2019 releases yesterday it seems that one of the bigger dock projects that may be delayed a bit.","What is your current outlook on the possibility that we might have a lot accrued at Corpus, which I\u2019m sure would benefit your facilities there. And if there are indeed dock constraints would this affect MEH first since there\u2019s no public corporate price and then effect inland really get backed up? Or how should we think about that?","Joseph Gorder","Yes, Theresa that\u2019s a good question. Gary is close to this. Let\u2019s let him talk about it for a minute.","Gary Simmons","Yeah. So we\u2019re -- when we look at this, it looks like that there will be plenty of dock capacity available but there are some periods of time where it could get very tight. And so our focus really has been to make sure that we\u2019re connected to all of these lines coming out of the Permian and we can take barrels to Corpus or Three Rivers.","And then we\u2019ve also put effort into expanding our dock capacity from our Corpus Christi refinery. So part of that project is completed. By early second quarter we\u2019ll have that project 100% completed and essentially double our export capacity that we\u2019ll be able to put through our system.","The second part of your question, yes, I would expect it to really affect the MEH posting first. And then, yes, it will probably work its way back into the Permian as time goes on.","Theresa Chen","Got it. And switching gears a bit. So the natural gas pricing outlook seems pretty depressed, can you talk about how much of a tailwind this could be for your business this year?","Lane Riggs","Well, this is Lane. So that\u2019s -- obviously energy is a big part of the cost structure in our business. And it\u2019s been depressed for a while. So it\u2019s -- obviously it works not only to our advantage, but really the industry\u2019s advantage to compete in the world. I mean natural gas as how we run these refineries largely. And it\u2019s a big advantage for U.S. refining in general.","Joseph Gorder","Yeah. Really all industrial activity.","Theresa Chen","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Benny Wong","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, I just kind of want to follow-up on Paul\u2019s question around the Canadian barrels. There\u2019s more talk of north about building units, just wanted to get your perspective on that, if that\u2019s kind of a viable path for more Canadian barrels to reach the U.S. Gulf Coast.","And just curious have you kind of tested any of these unblended bitumen or facilities? And if they\u2019re really the more desirable type of feedstock that\u2019s what\u2019s been totaled at?","Gary Simmons","Yes, so this is Gary. And yes we took bitumen directly from Western Canada and ran it at our refinery at St. Charles and have ongoing discussions with several producers. You can get move a lot more by rail, if you take the undiluted barrel and it would fit well into our system and we have plenty of capacity to be able to run it. ","Benny Wong","Thanks Gary. Appreciate that. And my follow-up is more on the RFS program and maybe Jason can chime in on this is. There seems to be more focused in D.C. about what that program will look like after it sunsets in 2020? And it seems like the start of setting a higher octane gasoline standard is alive again.","Just wanted to get your thoughts on that? And if there is really a path for at this time or and I guess if you think about that program beyond 2022? Thanks.","Jason Fraser","Sure. Yes. And this is Jason. And you\u2019re right the tables that set the volumes expire in 2020. The program falls back into the hands of the EPA to set the volumes using certain standards as it got and it\u2019s still open. They hadn\u2019t signaled a lot about what they\u2019re going to do, but we would like to octane fuels to be part of the solution. We think that\u2019s a great answer.","It\u2019s great for the all those maybe for taxpayers, it\u2019s great for us. It keeps internal combustion engine more viable in this lower carbon world and more evolving competitor.","And its great for ethanol guys because they\u2019re a good choice of low-cost octane. So really it\u2019s a win\/win\/win solution that we would like to see the attraction. And we definitely are talking it up. We think it\u2019s a great solution for the country. ","Benny Wong","Great. Thanks, guys. ","Joseph Gorder","Thanks, Benny.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Roger Read","Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Joseph Gorder","Good morning.","Roger Read","Lot of the good stuff already been hit here, but maybe just to dig in a little bit more on sort of the North American performance versus the global performance. And you\u2019ve mentioned some benefits from NAPA, some benefits from natural gas and from butane. There were also in the last couple of months issues with tanker rates and things like that.","So as those events, let\u2019s call it normalized or in this business where everybody takes advantage of them pretty quickly. We are \u2013 the way goes advantages. What looks more sustainable for you here in the next few months versus what looks transitory not just worried so much our thinking hey, we\u2019re going to go to grade gasoline which has its own benefits just curious there, what you\u2019re seeing?","Joseph Gorder","Yes I think overall as long as the U.S. production is having to clear to the export markets, despite where freight rates go. We\u2019ll see good advantage running domestic light sweet crude at many of our assets.","We also see that running the heavy sour and the high sulfur fuel blend stocks into our high complexity assets looks to be very favorable for the foreseeable future, as well as a result of the IMO bunker spec change. Outside of that, I don\u2019t know what else I would add.","Lane Riggs","Roger, I want to add one line. I\u2019ll just add one thing. I think what you\u2019re really seeing is as we alluded to; we\u2019re marketing for low sulfur VGO and low sulfur ATV into the low sulfur fuel oil market. And then what that does is that really is constructed for SEC - for gasoline because SEC are going to be cut.","I mean, we\u2019ve sort of talked about it over the past really for the last two years when we were talking about IMO and that part of it is certainly playing out. I mean you\u2019ll see as the gasoline season rolls in, you\u2019ll get a - essentially that market is going to have to compete for feed that\u2019s into the gasoline market. So, it should be supportive of both really sort of both gasoline and diesel.","Roger Read","Okay. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe back to Teresa\u2019s question about natural gas. Obviously, cash OpEx guidance of over 4% is kind of higher than what we\u2019ve seen over the last few years. And I know there\u2019s been some changes in the consolidation of VLP and all that.","But I was just curious is that something that can be a help on the OpEx side that we should see? Or are there other things moving around here going to keep OpEx on the upper end?","Lane Riggs","So, hey Roger, if you - this is Lane again. So, if you compare our guidance to basically first quarter 2020 to first quarter 2019 is pretty much flat. That\u2019s sort of our large turnaround timeframe.","And so I would just sort of say that\u2019s flat year-over-year. But when you look at the longer term, certainly, we\u2019ve had realignment reporting structures. We moved the renewable in the Diamond Green Diesel out and we\u2019ve taken all the MLP stuff which would have been in our sort of cost of goods and it came into our OpEx. And so as we realigned all that stuff it sort of resulted in a little bit in terms of our OpEx a little bit higher.","And then overall there are - obviously there\u2019s some inflationary pressures in the world. When you - again, when you compare our overall cash OpEx performance on sort of what we would call a basis we are by far in the first quarter, so which means we are the pacesetters in the industry when it comes to cost.","Roger Read","That\u2019s pretty well answers. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC. Your line is now open.","Brad Heffern","Hi, everyone. A question maybe for Lane on throughput. So this quarter there was almost 1.7 million barrels a day of suite. I think you guys have quoted that capacity historically is more like 1.6%.","So, is there something that\u2019s changed? Is that something that running the resid is allowing you to do? And then how should we think about that going forward with some of the dips like Maya widening out?","Joseph Gorder","So, what you\u2019re I kind of touched on it a little bit earlier as we\u2019re running more and more the resid doesn\u2019t really have that much lighting components. So, as it substitutes and sort of move up either heavy or really - the real thing that we\u2019re backing out if you look at year-over-year medium sour.","So, what\u2019s happening is we\u2019re running more and more light sweet which -- what that\u2019s doing is sort of it\u2019s substituting for medium which does have some into it. So, that\u2019s a journey we\u2019re on. We\u2019ve been signaling max light fleet crude and max heavy and we optimize between heavy sour crudes and resid. And so we\u2019ll -- and I don\u2019t know that we can go a whole lot higher, but we\u2019ll just see quarter-to-quarter and see how much higher we can go.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thanks for that. And then Joe in your prepared comments, you were talking about sort of different things competing for capital and you mentioned M&A as you have in the past. I know you haven\u2019t done a whole bunch recently. You\u2019ve done some ethanol deals or is the terminals acquisition. I guess can you just put any meat on that in terms of what you would potentially be interested in on the M&A front?","Joseph Gorder","Yes, why don\u2019t we let Rich talk about that?","Rich Lashway","Sure. This is Rich. Hey, Brad. So yeah we continue to look at the opportunities as they arrive. As they arise, a lot of this stuff tends to be in niche markets. And we\u2019re focused on the Gulf Coast and just haven\u2019t seen a lot of things arise there. That\u2019s where we would capture the synergies and where we would have the advantage.","So I mean, we look at everything as it comes up, but we don\u2019t see any opportunities that compete against the pipeline of organic projects that we have.","Brad Heffern","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Jason Gabelman","Yeah. Hey guys, morning. I\u2019d like to ask a question about the ethanol and renewable diesel segment. It looks like the indicators have fallen quite a bit from 4Q to year-to-date. And I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s going on in those two markets? And how you see that evolving throughout the course of the year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Martin Parrish","Okay. This is Martin. On the renewable diesel, the indicator drops because the -- you have the blenders tax credit in place now. So we gave up a little bit on the RIN, feedstock costs got a little higher, but you need to add $1 a gallon to that indicator to get really where market is. So again we\u2019re 126 pro forma, but that\u2019s really a $2.26 EBITDA per gallon, so that one is not concerning at all.","Fourth quarter ethanol was what $0.14 a gallon, EBITDA was our performance that\u2019s come in and you\u2019re correct there. January is always tough in the business. I mean, domestic gasoline demand is low, ethanol inventories always build in January.","Really what\u2019s happened in the ethanol space we\u2019ve been oversupplied in the U.S. for several years. Exports were growing at 30% CAGR up through 2018. 2019 they took a breather and that was really due to low sugar prices in the world. So Brazil made more ethanol.","Right now though sugar prices are up 20% versus where they averaged 2019, export demand is strong. We\u2019re seeing really good numbers in December, January, February and March.","So we still - ethanol is in the fuel mix to stay in the U.S. little bit of incremental E15, and then hopefully this higher octane standard would really help the industry obviously. So we\u2019re still optimistic about the future.","Jason Gabelman","Thanks. I appreciate those thoughts. And then if I could just go back to running resid high sulfur fuel oil. Can you just put some numbers around or discuss how much of that -- those intermediates you\u2019re running and backing out crude as a result? And how much of that is incremental feedstock?","And in addition to that, are there any type of indicative economics that you could give on running those barrels. I understand there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but are we talking low single-digit dollar per barrel, high single-digit dollar per barrel in the double digit range? Just to give us a sense of what the uptake is? Thanks.","Lane Riggs","Hi. So this is Lane. We\u2019re not going to share our detailed volumes in terms of how we do all that. And obviously the relative margins are all a function of what the market is. They\u2019re not fixed off one another. There is a dynamic market out there, that\u2019s a function of the crude market, the high sulfur fuel oil market, the low sulfur fuel market, the latter two of which are still trying to sort themselves out with respect to IMO 2020. So these things vary just like any other feedstock that we run.","There\u2019s not a guaranteed margin relative to one another. And as all the refining capacity looks at all this and optimizes then if they -- the margins are going to be different over time. So, there\u2019s nothing that -- there\u2019s not anything we can communicate that you can hang your hat on per se.","Jason Gabelman","Okay. Thanks.","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, and Holt. Your line is now open.","Matthew Blair","I wanted to check in on asphalt and pet coke. I know it\u2019s only about 3% of your product slate, but how has pricing and realizations fared on these areas just given all the volatility on high sulfur fuel oil in the recent weakness?","Gary Simmons","Yes. So this is Gary. I think overall we\u2019ve been surprised that asphalt margins have stayed relatively strong. We thought that there may be an attempt to push a lot of these high sulfur resid into the asphalt market, you would see weakness. But thus far, asphalt margins in our system have remained strong. And I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve seen much of an impact at all on pet coke.","Matthew Blair","Sounds good. And then the sales volumes in renewable diesel were quite strong in the fourth quarter. Just wanted to confirm was that a result of selling down some inventory or did the plant to actually run at those levels?","Gary Simmons","We ran at those levels.","Matthew Blair","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Chris Sighinolfi","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on Neil\u2019s earlier sustainability question if I could. And I just have two questions. I guess first Joe have you looked at CCUS investment to capture incremental carbon off facilities?","I know some of your integrated peers are working on that specifically on ethanol facilities to using some of their EOR operations. So, I\u2019m just wondering if it\u2019s something you looked at and what the opportunity set might be?","Joseph Gorder","We are looking at it. Yes. And Martin and Rich are they got a team put together and we\u2019re kind of down the road on this. I think -- I guess the real question that we\u2019re trying to you always wonder about what\u2019s the cost of care are going to be what the economics is going to look like on an investment in a project like this. So, we are looking at it though.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And then I guess second in light of the BTC extension [indiscernible] has clearly become more valuable as noted it\u2019s a key pillar in your environmental sustainability story which is clearly set apart from your refining peers.","But Joe I\u2019m just curious do you think you get appropriate credit for that and the ethanol franchise within Valero? And I guess what are any thoughts or internal evaluation about if or when those businesses might make more sense being independent?","Joseph Gorder","Yes. Well, those are two very different questions. One is do we think it matters from an ES&G perspective and I think it definitely does. We have a very clear view of what -- where things are going and what the world is demanding now. And we really believe renewable fuel is a key component of that. And the good news is that they both happen to be great businesses and we\u2019ve got great assets and good teams.","So, I think as time goes on, people will see that Valero somewhat differentiated perhaps from others out there because of these investments. As far as separating them off, my view is they are producers of motor fuels and different types of motor fuels, very low carbon intensity motor fuels, but they\u2019re motor fuels and Valero produces motor fuels.","That\u2019s what our business is and we do it really well. And these are largely process operations and they integrate well, processes that we\u2019ve implemented on the refining side are scalable to our ethanol plants and to the renewable diesel operations. And so I think frankly being embedded in the company, it brings more value to Valero that it would just split it out.","Chris Sighinolfi","That\u2019s perfect. Thanks a lot for the time. Appreciate it.","Joseph Gorder","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I\u2019m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Homer Bhullar for closing remarks.","Homer Bhullar","Great. Thank you. We appreciate everyone joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Sylvia, and I will be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions)","Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Ashley Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Smith, you may begin.","Ashley Smith","Thank you, Sylvia and good morning to everyone listening to our earnings call today. With me today are Bill Klesse, our Chairman and CEO; Joe Gorder, President and COO; Mike Ciskowski, our CFO; Gene Edwards, our Chief Development Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact me after the call.","Slide 2 directs your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC.","So as noted in the release, we reported fourth quarter 2013 earnings of $1.3 billion or $2.38 per share. Excluding the $325 million nontaxable gain on the disposition of Valero\u2019s retained interest in CST Brands, our adjusted fourth quarter 2013 earnings were $963 million, or $1.78 per share, which compares with fourth quarter 2012 adjusted earnings of $1.05 billion or $1.88 per share. ","For the full year 2013, we reported earnings of $2.7 billion or $4.97 per share. Excluding the aforementioned gain and special items related to our May 1 spin-off of CST Brands to Valero\u2019s stockholders as detailed in the release, full year 2013 adjusted earnings were $2.4 billion or $4.42 per share. ","Operating income was nearly the same in the fourth quarters of both 2013 and 2012. An increase in ethanol operating income was offset by decreases in the refining and retail segments. The retail segment decrease was due mainly to the effects of the May 1 spin-off of CST Brands. The decrease in refining segment fourth quarter operating income from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to three key items, additional depreciation and amortization driven mainly by the hydrocracker units at our Port Arthur and St. Charles refineries; increase in operating expenses most driven by higher energy costs and a decrease in throughput margin.","Refining segment throughput margin in the fourth quarter of 2013 was $11.20 per barrel, which is down approximately $1 per barrel versus the fourth quarter of 2012. The decrease in gasoline and diesel margins in our regions was mostly offset by an increase in medium and heavy sour crude discount.","Propeller on the crude pricing from the fourth quarter of 2012 to fourth quarter of 2013, the Mars medium sour crude discount to Brent increased favorably by $7.66 per barrel and Maya heavy sour crude oil discount to Brent increased favorably by $2.73 per barrel.","Regarding light crude pricing during the same timeframe, WTI discounts to Brent narrowed unfavorably by $10.10 per barrel, while the LLS prices improved favorably by $8.39 per barrel going from a premium to a discount versus Brent.","Our refining throughput volumes averaged $2.8 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter, which is an increase of 139,000 barrels per day versus the fourth quarter of 2012. Refining volumes were higher, primarily due to less maintenance activity and the initiatives of favorable crude discounts, particularly for light crude in our Gulf Coast system. Refining cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2013 were $3.79 per barrel. This was similar to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Our ethanol segment earned record operating income of $269 million in the fourth quarter and $491 million for the year. The outstanding results are attributed to strong gross margins driven by low industry ethanol inventories and a decline in corn prices, which combined with record high quarterly average production volumes of 3.6 million gallons per day.","In the fourth quarter of 2013, general and administrative expenses, excluding corporate depreciation were $175 million. Net interest expense was $102 million and total depreciation and amortization expense was $437 million.","The effective tax rate was 28.6%, which is lower than guidance due to the $325 million non-taxable gain on the liquidation of our CST Brands shares in November. Adjusting for this item, the effective tax rate was 35%.","At the end of the year, total debt was $6.6 billion and cash and temporary investments was $4.3 billion, of which $375 million was held by Valero Energy Partners LP. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio net of cash was 10.2% and we had over $6.2 billion of available liquidity in addition to cash.","Regarding cash flows in the fourth quarter, capital expenditures were $538 million, including $107 million for turnaround and catalyst. Also in the fourth quarter, we received net proceeds of $369 million from the offering of Valero Energy Partners LP, that cash was retained in the partnerships. We also received $448 million of net proceeds from the disposition of our remaining interest in CST Brands, which included $19 million in associated fees.","In the quarter, we returned $459 million in cash to our stockholders, paying $120 million in dividends and by purchasing approximately 8.3 million shares of Valero common stock for $339 million.","This brings our full year 2013 stock purchases to 22.4 million shares for $920 million plus dividends of $462 million for total of cash returned to stockholders of nearly $1.4 billion. For perspective that is more than double the total cash that we returned to stockholders in 2012.","Also in 2013, our spinoff of CST Brands was a dividend to Valero`s shareholders, based on its current recent equivalent value to approximately $3.60 per share of Valero including CST Brands cash dividends.","Earlier this month, we continue to show our commitment to return cash to stockholders by purchasing 4 million shares of Valero common stock for $208 million and by increasing the regular cash dividend last week.","For 2013, capital expenditures, including turnarounds and catalysts, were $2.76 billion, or more than $90 million below our previous guidance. For 2014, we maintain our guidance for capital expenditures, including turnarounds and catalysts, at approximately $3 billion. ","Similar to 2013, we expect approximately 50% of total spending beyond stay-in business capital. The other half of our 2014 capital spending is allocated to strategic growth investments, largely in logistics, increasing our capability to process light crude oil. ","For modeling our first quarter operations, you should refinery throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges, U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.475 million to 1.525 million barrels per day; U.S. Mid-Continent at 390,000 to 410,000 barrels per day; U.S. West Coast at 230,000 to 240,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 440,000 to 460,000 barrels per day. We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be around $4 per barrel.","For our ethanol operations in the first quarter, we expect total production volumes of 3.6 million gallons per day, and operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.04 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.","Also in the first quarter, we expect G&A expense, excluding depreciation, to be around $160 million, and net interest expense should be about $100 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter should be around $420 million, and our effective tax rate in the first quarter should be approximately 35%.","Okay, Sylvia, we have concluded our opening remarks. We will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) We have Doug Leggate, BofA Merrill Lynch.","Doug Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch","I\u2019ve got a couple of micro questions. Actually, I'm hoping you can at least give your perspective on. The first one is that affects you guys in the Gulf Coast is the pricing of Maya. It continues as an indicator I guess of heavy sour in the Gulf -- it continues to trade fairly wide relative to LLS in particular. Are you guys seeing anything that is happening differently in terms of either flows out of Mexico or the [K-factor pricing that AMEX] is using? Any color on how sustainable you think this might be? I've got a follow-up question. ","Gary Simmons","Doug, this is Gary Simmons. The Maya formula -- 40% of the Maya formula is based on WTS. And so I think a lot of what you are seeing the Maya formula is that they are basically chasing the Brent TIR. And so it got very narrow and then Brent TIR widened back out and Maya went with it. So we are seeing some additional production come to us. I think some of that was due to refinery turnarounds in Mexico. So we are getting some volume above our contract levels. But the pricing has been more tied to volatility in the Brent TIR than anything else.","Doug Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch","Could you give a perspective, Gary, as to whether this is something that is just somewhat transitory, or does it change the way you think about your feedstock given -- all the talk is obviously on light sweet in the Gulf but heavy is going to trade out wide. How does the end product you are planning in terms of how you\u2019re going to basically plan your slate going forward?","Gary Simmons","We have a lot of flexibility in the Gulf Coast system, being able to swing from the heavy barrels to the light. It\u2019s been encouraging that the Mayas continue to price at competitive values to the medium sour and the light. I don\u2019t think it really changes our thinking going forward, Doug.","Doug Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch","My follow-up is also a micro question if I may. And it relates to the gasoline. We are all focused on gasoline exports in terms of the expansion you guys have got going on. So I wonder first of all if you could give us an update as to where you are currently and it really what\u2019s -- my question is it seems to us that the U.S. was self-sufficient across the country for the first time in the fourth quarter. And we basically are seeing gasoline in the Gulf trade under Brent in terms of apples-to-apples basis. So I\u2019m just curious as to -- are you concerned, we\u2019re going to see gasoline pricing move away from Brent towards the domestic crude and if so, how does that change your export policy and I\u2019ll leave it there? Thank you.","Joe Gorder","Hey Doug, this is Joe. Listen on the exports, in the quarter, we did 133,000 barrels a day of gasoline exports. December was particularly strong but it was pretty consistent throughout the entire quarter. If you look forward to the first quarter, I would tell you that we\u2019re seeing volumes at similar levels. And it all has to do with the fact that it did -- we had some low prices and the Latin American countries continue to be short and so we have the opportunity to move the barrels there.","I\u2019ll just give you the distillate number, you didn\u2019t ask but while we\u2019re on this, we exported an average of 219,000 barrels a day distillate in the quarter. And those volumes look consistent going forward also. As far as the -- I guess the longer term view of gasoline and its relationship, we are in strange period right now. Prices have been low. Refinery run rates in the Gulf Coast have been very, very high so we\u2019ve had significant volumes in production and we\u2019re at the time of the year when gasoline demand is historically down.","And so I guess the guy has pulled the staff here that came out just today and we had a pretty good pop in gasoline demand. But we\u2019re getting into that time of the year although its hard to imagine right now with this cold season, we\u2019re getting to that time of the year where ultimately we\u2019ll stop lending butanes and gasoline pool tightened up, which you get a little bit of recovery in the margin. So I don\u2019t really see that much difference this year versus last. Gene?","Gene Edwards","This is Gene. My only extra comment would be I think as you move into the several periods, ultimately the gasoline is got to revert back to a Brent-related type crack because of incremental refineries in the world are suffice enough of a Brent-price crude.","Operator","Okay. We have Ed Westlake from Credit Suisse.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Hey and thanks for the time and obviously great earnings. Congratulations. Obviously Q3 to Q4, there was a big swing and there is a number of different things that could have accounted for that. I mean, crude discounts widened out in the Gulf, butane blending in winter, products exports, we just had a brief discussion on them. Secondary products was something that hurt in Q3 and obviously got better in Q4 if the crude prices came back a bit and then obviously that continued self help that you guys are putting in with the new units. I\u2019m just trying to look for some color as to which do you think of those or something else, I mean, RINs maybe drove the big delta Q over Q?","Ashley Smith","Yeah. Ed, you kind of nailed most of those things. This is Ashley. I\u2019d say in absolute terms, there is a million way you can slice and dice it but in absolute terms, the biggest -- somewhat in terms of indicator or capture rate, one of the biggest drivers was just outright crude discounts helping out.","After that from 3Q to 4Q, the decrease in RINs cost helped on a capture rate basis, absolutely being able to blend butane which can get a price more like you finished gasoline, helped out. I'd say those are the key drivers but just hitting the better crude discounts help not only in capture rate but also outright discount, outright cracks or margins.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","Thank you. And then the second unrelated question is obviously light crude is coming out to you thick and fast from the Eagle Ford and eventually at Permian in all the pipes. So that\u2019s very helpful and you\u2019ve announced that you\u2019re thinking about some popping units for late 2015. You said relatively low cost for barrel. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got an actual cost. That would be helpful. But generally, if you can talk about how you take your sort of slightly heavier design refineries to be able to actually process this light crude that perhaps is better in other people\u2019s refineries?","Bill Klesse","Hey, this is Bill. When we are going ahead with our 70,000 barrel a day crude -- light crude unit at Corpus and Lyondell Crude Unit at Houston. We have approval to do that. And those are the designed to run normally about [58 acres], which is a little bit lighter than our crude diet in either of those crude units that we have existing. But we can run some on those lighter, a little bit incrementally lighter crude. We have less flexibility to be able to run something that looks little bit more like WTI, a little bit down to the low 40s. But these are really our big additions in terms of (inaudible) additions to the Gulf Coast capacity to run this type of (inaudible).","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","These projects don\u2019t convert a heavy refinery to run light crude. They generally take light-to-medium refineries and just allow them to process additional light crude, but still have the downstream units.","Gary Simmons","And so, a little more color on that, what we do is we, essentially are backing out. Both those refineries are short toping capacity and long conversion capacity. So it will allow us to do (inaudible) to build our conversion capacity. So it's really displacing VGO and light sulfur [ATP]. But it\u2019s not moving us from -- it\u2019s not -- Ashley commented, we\u2019re adding crude capacity. We\u2019re not displacing crude capacity.","Bill Klesse","We haven\u2019t seen any incentives to destroy heavy capacity because this counts a lot. So most of this is just adding in time, either adding through construction or through processing and operations, finding additional debottlenecking and capability to process light crude.","Ed Westlake - Credit Suisse","And if down the road, light did completely disconnect and heavy stayed links to global markets, how -- what would be the first thoughts on in terms of how you adjust -- would adjust the units to get these heavy refineries a little bit more flexible in terms of what they could take?","Gary Simmons","We\u2019re still -- we still have some additional capacity we think within our existing units down there. And it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll just -- we\u2019ll continue to work on. It\u2019s all a function of how disconnected it actually is and is it really there. But we still have some open capacity to run additional light crude in our Gulf Coast as it is today. And then after you get to -- when you really -- as you get there and you drive towards these one, then it\u2019s all about trying to test what are the marginal economics of weak crude, versus medium, versus heavy. And we\u2019ll just -- we\u2019ll find out, but it\u2019s just a matter of how disconnected it is. ","Operator","","And we have Jeff Dietert from Simmons & Company.","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company","","My question has to do with Gulf Coast overall imports. We had another robust import number in the DOEs today despite the wide differentials that were in place in November and December which I would assume established the import levels. It appears that the countries that are shipping crude to the U.S. are continuing to ship despite the disincentives that were in place during the fourth quarter. Can you comment on what you\u2019re seeing on about light and medium and heavy crude imports coming into the Gulf Coast? Are those staying pretty stable for you? And what are you seeing more broadly in the industry?","Lane Riggs","Yeah, so overall I would say we are not importing light crude into the Gulf routinely anymore at all. Our imports are medium sour and the heavy sour. On the medium sour side, some of the medium sours that we were taking into the Gulf, we\u2019ve now shifted and a lot of those barrels are now going to the West Coast and the heavy sour has been somewhat [stake].","Jeff Dietert - Simmons & Company","Secondly, could you update us on the hydrocracker rates? How are they performing both at Port Arthur and St. Charles and how are they performing in the fourth quarter and so far on 1Q?","Lane Riggs","This is Lane Riggs again. They run very well in the fourth quarter and they\u2019re currently running well -- I would say we were able to optimize our Port Arthur refinery and looking at our permits. Really our permits are based on a heat release or firing rates as we\u2019ve got -- as we ran 57,000 barrels a day and looked at a little bit more optimized. We\u2019ve actually been able to get the rates up to 50,000 barrels a day normally and still live inside our (inaudible) format. But other than that they\u2019re running, as designed and doing quite well of course.","Operator","And we have Sam Margolin from Cowen and Company.","Sam Margolin - Cowen and Company","I guess, I\u2019ll circle back to imports for a second. That\u2019s probably going to lead to a follow up. It\u2019s in our observation that a significant portion of the medium imports are leftover industry wide are from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, something like 80% and more or less everything else, legacy, medium imports from Nigeria and other places have been backed out. Are these volumes from Saudi and Kuwait just much sticker because refining interests from the exporting countries here, or just because they are in more of a -- it's more in their interest to maintain the U.S. market share with those volumes? And I guess what I\u2019m getting at is, are these -- with everything else getting backed out from the medium pool at a pretty rapid rate, are those volumes really an unlikely candidate to follow that trend?","Joe Gorder","For us, it really is a matter of economics and we\u2019ve continued to see the barrels that we are getting from Saudi and the barrels we are getting from Kuwait to be economic. Again, we\u2019ve shifted some of that volume to the west coast and we see better value in moving us to the west coast now that we have other options available to us in the gulf. But for us, it\u2019s an economic question.","Sam Margolin - Cowen and Company","Okay. So it\u2019s basically just a matter of price and the exporters are going to make the determination of whether there's another location descended to, or whether they need to market the U.S. pricing?","Joe Gorder","Yes.","Sam Margolin - Cowen and Company","Basically. Okay. And then this is a follow-up on imports and replacing imported crude with domestic crudes. The time to delivery of the average barrels for your systems has been reduced significantly. It's always stands to reason that the industry is able to structurally handle a lot lower import -- a lot lower inventory levels kind of on an ongoing basis. And we\u2019ve seen significant draws up until this week of inventory from the Gulf Coast and I was just wondering if that is sort of de-risking of your supply is contributing to that at all, and if that\u2019s also why the curve is so backward dated essentially?","Joe Gorder","It\u2019s difficult to say, but we just haven\u2019t seen and as we switched to more and more domestic crude, it is having an impact on the inventory and the required inventories in our system for exactly the reasons you are seeing.","Sam Margolin - Cowen and Company","All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we have Robert Kessler from Tudor Pickering.","Robert Kessler - Tudor Pickering","Good morning, gentlemen.","Joe Gorder","Hey, good morning, Robert.","Robert Kessler - Tudor Pickering","I wanted to ask about Quebec City, as that refinery is slowly transitioning to 100% North America of crude feedstocks, can you give us the numbers for the quarter and how much was delivered by rail and by ship from Texas, and maybe, if I can add a bonus to that, the average light in crude price to that refinery for the quarter?","Joe Gorder","Well, I don\u2019t have it. We will give you the average light in crude cost. But I can tell you that our rail has come up and it\u2019s been very successful. It has a capacity to do about 60,000 barrels a day, started up in August. And we continued to ramp up volumes. We begin to hit some snags with the weather in December and January. The cold weather really hurt that operation. We were up to about 40,000 barrels a day in November. The volumes did falloff in December and January a little bit to the cold weather.","We also exported five cargoes from the Gulf to Canada in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019ve run Canadian Syn for the first time. At Quebec, we\u2019ve run WTI, we\u2019ve run Bakken and we run Eagle Ford. We continue to ramp up our volumes there. In the fourth quarter, we saw some weather issues even on the gulf movements that hurt us.","We continue to see some challenges on the logistics to be able to get the barrels to the water. And then as you get into the winter, Quebec, the fact that we have ice-clad ships in the supply chain also hinder our ability some to be able to get to well there but we continue to ramp up those volumes and seek good economics on those barrels compared to our Brent related alternatives.","Robert Kessler - Tudor Pickering","That\u2019s good to hear. What was the average throughput for the refinery overall for the quarter?","Joe Gorder","Yeah. Robert, I\u2019m going to continue to take Brent near traditionally high records or at traditionally high rates, but we are going to disclose refinery by refinery throughputs and margins, things like that.","Robert Kessler - Tudor Pickering","Okay. And everything going on track is -- ","Joe Gorder","We are just going to say, as you can see from the regional data for North Atlantic region, it\u2019s been at fairly high rates.","Robert Kessler - Tudor Pickering","Yeah. And everything is on track as far as future expansion capacities to take North American crude? Most notably, I guess the additional loading capacity in Corpus fell mid this year, coming on with another 50,000 barrels a day or so.","Joe Gorder","Yeah, so two significant changes during the year. Mid-year, the Corpus loading facility coming on line and then in the fourth quarter, we expect the Line 9 reversal online also.","Robert Kessler - Tudor Pickering","Yeah, you\u2019re pretty confident that it\u2019s 4Q and not 1Q?","Joe Gorder","","Everything we hear still covers 4Q.","Operator","","We have Blake Fernandez from Howard Weil.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated","","Guys good morning, I had a couple of broader questions for you. The first one is on rail regulations. Obviously we\u2019re hearing some rumblings of more stringent regulations coming down here potentially at some point. And I guess I\u2019m thing about this correctly, certainly would help support differentials on the refining side but then potentially impact some of the potential earnings you would get on the logistics side, in the third call you got about over 5,300 railcars on the way. And I\u2019m just curious if you could talk about how you see this unfolding. Does this impact your decision on owning versus leasing and basically any dynamics you see unfolding as a result of this?","Joe Gorder","","Sure Blake, this is Joe and I\u2019m very impressed that you got our number of railcars, you remembered.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated","Thank you.","Joe Gorder","Obviously man, this is an issue. The DOT has the ball, they\u2019re involved. They\u2019re working the regulations and I think the date that we\u2019ve talked about here, they should have recommendations in place by November 14. This is also an issue that\u2019s being worked by the American Association of Railroads, by AFPM and many others. And I would say obviously the conversations are around hiking the standards on cars. So that would be something that we would expect to see. There is a conversation around rerouting around urban areas, slower speeds through urban areas, a lot of focus on classification of the cargo, so what type of crude is being carried, all those things would make sense. And I think we would expect to see some of that. The one issue that\u2019s hanging out there that none of us really know about because of the nature of the rail fleet is how long would it take to retrofit and how long will they allow for a phase in of any recommended changes. ","The 5320 cars that we have on quarter are all the rural [111A] cars. So they do have additional safety features over traditional cars. So we\u2019re just kind of waiting to see where that goes but we believe that cars that would meet the schedule will be okay. As far as changing what we\u2019re doing, I don\u2019t see that this is going to have any impact on our plans to move crude by rail. And then as you say, what happens if that materially affected the economic. We currently have some 6,000 cars under lease in the fleet and what we would do is ultimately just go ahead and replace the cars that we have now under lease with the cars that we own and we continue to use them for other services such as asphalt and ethanol, so not a lot of downside for our investment in the railcars.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated","","Good, good, thank Joe. And then the second question; a little bit off but on the ethanol side, obviously this has been a home run of an investment for you guys. And you brought at the right time and obviously you\u2019ve recouped all of that investment if I\u2019m not mistaken. But I\u2019m just curious is there a lot of synergy between that and your refining business? I guess where I\u2019m going is that ultimately it's just a flip where you could basically just sell it at a premium and take your profits and walk away.","Gene Edwards","","Yeah. Blake, this is Gene. The ethanol is doing quite well. We produce more ethanol than we actually blend ourselves. It's not necessarily even the same barrels. We try to optimize both. We try to get the highest net back at our ethanol plants and then our marketing operations tries to procure ethanol at the lowest cost. Sometimes those intersect, sometimes they don\u2019t. So I\u2019d say there\u2019s probably not a whole lot of synergy there. It\u2019s roughly run -- they think it could be run in this independent business. We\u2019re very happy with the returns we\u2019re getting now and I don\u2019t think the multiples you would get in case -- because last year, it was basically a breakeven business. This year we made almost $500 million. In the prior year -- 2011, we made almost $400 million. So we\u2019re not exactly sure how that would trade in the market place due that volatility, I think which is good. Also we have a significant tax gain because you have a rapid depreciation, tax depreciation we had on the stout. I think we\u2019re satisfied with investment. We always look at our options too.","Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated","","Okay, thanks Gene.","Operator","","And we have Roger Read from Wells Fargo.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo Securities","","I guess, a couple of questions, so many things have been hit here, but kind of getting back to the crude exports to Canada question, and may be not the exact feedstocks to the refinery or the crude cost this time around. But what much -- how much more progress do you need to more or less convert that refinery to pure North American crude? And then what\u2019s that -- once that is done, is there anything you can do about moving things to Pembroke and advantage ways that something you would want to do in the current regime or do we need changes in the -- either from the President or Congress on that front?","Bill Klesse","So, overall, Roger, we anticipate that by the end of the year Quebec will be running 100% North American domestic crude. You will continue to see volume ramp-up. I mentioned the two step changes that occur, we get our corporate stock in place mid-year that will certainly help and the line 9 reversal, when line 9 reversal is complete and they certainly will be on 100% domestic crude. The Pembroke question is a little bit more difficult. We don\u2019t see that we\u2019ve be looking to export to Pembroke at least any time in the short-term.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then in terms of the bigger projects you are undertaking in Corpus and in Houston to move to using more light. What else are you able to do, maybe just tweaking around the edges, but maybe in the aggregate, how many barrels of light be, you think you might be able to run, say 12 months from now versus what you\u2019re running today or what you ran in the fourth quarter along the Gulf Coast?","Lane Riggs","This is Lane. I thought we had answered that question back, but there are crude units are -- will an additional 150,000 barrels a day domestic light crude capacity. We believe we have somewhere on the order of about 300,000 to 315,000 barrels a day of crude capacity on the Gulf Coast.","But, again, as I mentioned earlier, we have not build all that capacity up yet, so you\u2019ll see the economic become actually compelling, all the logistics get bottleneck, we will approach that number and I think -- I\u2019m pretty confident, we\u2019ll be higher than that number that\u2019s where we are today.","Bill Klesse","And the crude fraction areas our top reserve a 15 project not a 12 months.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo Securities","Right, right. Now understood, it\u2019s too different, I was trying to understand other than the two very large projects, what are some of the smaller things that can happen, maybe on is high-profile but ultimately do have a positive impact?","And then, I guess, my last question, cash flow, I think, I actually mentioned at the beginning about twice the amount of capital return to shareholders in \u201913 versus 2012. Can you give us an indication of what you would expect or what you would plan to do in 2014? I mean, I know, you don't want to give guidance on a specific number but maybe as a percentage of cash flow versus what we saw in 2013 that we could expect to be directed towards share repurchases, dividend, et cetera.","Mike Ciskowski","Well, we just raised our dividend to a $1 share on an annual basis. So that\u2019s $540 million. And then on top of that our capital budget is $3 billion and then the rest of it is how we conducted ourselves in the past and we take a relatively balanced approach here. We look at our dividend as the year goes on. We\u2019ll look at our investment opportunities and I think you can expect the same actions you\u2019ve seen from us in the past.","Roger Read - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we have Faisel Kahn from Citigroup.","Faisel Kahn - Citigroup","Good morning.","Bill Klesse","Hi Faisel.","Faisel Kahn - Citigroup","Hi. Just if I get a little bit more, I think, you may have answers this in your prepared remarks. But I\u2019m looking at the capture rates sort of going up sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Can you give a little bit of breakdown of the -- of what kind of cause that to the increase in the capture. How much was crude-related I guess in percentage terms versus how much was product related?","Mike Ciskowski","About half and this is very general\u2026","Faisel Kahn - Citigroup","Yeah.","Mike Ciskowski","\u2026 because each regions get its own specifics and then about half was crude-related, the other you could say was product or RINs related. Things like be able to blend butane, so the indicator is more accurate versus, compared to what we\u2019re actually doing and then RINs coming down. So in general its half was kind of crude related and remainders are mix of things including all that stuff. ","Faisel Kahn - Citigroup","","Okay. And then, just on the ethanol side of the equation, what's your sort of outlook for the rest of the year? I mean, is this something that sort of can be sustained over the course of '14 or is -- are the other factors kind of work against this sort of level of profitability?","Gene Edwards","","Hi. This is Gene. First of all, 2013 was a world of contrast, it started the year at breakeven margins, some of the plants were actually down and the fourth quarter was a really big month where we had like 80% margins. I think if you look at our [divided] numbers out, we averaged about $0.40 margin on -- for the year, which you've started January a little higher than that, but that's about where we are today. It's about $0.40 going forward.","How it pans out through those, it's very volatile, because it's a result between ethanol price and corn price which really don't correlate. But, however, ethanol (inaudible) remains pretty low. Our production is hanging right around 900,000 barrels a day. I think demand has strengthened the average under the RFS about 850,000 barrels a day. So we\u2019d normally be in a build situation, but we are exporting a lot of ethanol with lower form factors, lower ethanol prices as a result. We're seeing good export economics. We're filing lower cost ethanol in Brazil in the long markets.","So that's what\u2019s keeping the market fairly [snuck] as far as inventories. The only other thing I would add I guess is that the production numbers start to ramp up, you could build from there. But later we always maintain that we have really good competitive advantage, so we've been here in over supply situation, we have -- we fell like we have a $0.20 or so gallon margin, the competitors starts dropping, some of these (inaudible) start to fall back off.","So long answer but, lot of uncertainty there. I don't think directionally it's going to be $0.80 margin we saw in the fourth quarter, but something new in the between $0.20 and $0.40 is probably something that would be a reasonable expectation. ","Operator","And we have Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning, guys. There is lots of focus on the light side here, this morning, but Keystone started up last week, actually it\u2019s running at about 40,000 barrels a day currently. I know line fill was primarily light crude, are you seeing any of that in both of those market today? Or if you have your light do you see an ability, potential ability are -- heavy barrels that are increasing storage today that's estimated at over [500 million] barrels?","Gary Simmons","","Yes. The barrels being offered off the line are really being priced at something competitive to Maya in the Gulf today barrels that are coming off.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","","(Inaudible) reflects of impact yet from those volumes right?","Gary Simmons","","No, there really hasn't yet.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","And do you expect that would take time given the K factor or do you think that might develop sooner?","Gary Simmons","Well, I think, you still -- you know the trouble with getting significant volumes of Canadian heavy to the Gulf is still getting the barrels across the border. So it will make a difference, but I don't know how bigger difference it will make in the Gulf.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","But, obviously, a different question on potential crude oil exports and not on the policy question, but you know you are one of the only refineries that have exported crude off the Gulf Coast. The system has clearly been designed its entire history to import crude. I mean, can you discuss some of the coastal infrastructure and logistic issues that were related for you to reverse those flows and just the system limitations that made pose a risk if there is any loosening of that policy.","Gary Simmons","Well, that's difficult to answer. Some of the challenges we're seeing, I will just kind of go through some of those -- the logistics are still very much a challenge in the Gulf and so some of the issues we've seen is just the barrels that show up at the dock are not necessarily what we are expecting to load on to the ship. So certainly some tankage needs to be built out in the Gulf, ability to be able to segregate barrels better. And that's kind of why we have taken the path that we want to be able to completely control the logistics and load the barrels on over our own dock and at Corpus for that very reason.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","And where were you on the quarter on the water exports to Quebec.","Bill Klesse","We need five partners to Quebec in the fourth quarter.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","And is that your -- what would be your max run rate is?","Bill Klesse","We can run a lot more than that. At Quebec, really the issue was primarily the logistics are getting the barrels on the water. And then for us the other thing is most of those grades were new to refineries. So we don\u2019t want to send the bunch of crude that they never run before. So those have been processed now. We have the operating history and we can continue to ramp up as the logistics allow.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Right. So logistics being the primary bottleneck there?","Bill Klesse","Yes.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","And then just lastly, any comments on Aruba and I know, given change in crude dynamics in the Gulf. Does that breathe any potential life into that asset or any comments there? I\u2019ll leave it there.","Bill Klesse","This is Klesse. There is some interest in the market place but really in the cokers and it\u2019s more tied to upgrading. I would say there\u2019s no interest for processing oil or anything there.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","So do you think more like\u2026?","Bill Klesse","(Inaudible)","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","So a bit more, maybe a second derivative effect, if there is a negative effect toward heavy pricing in the Gulf?","Bill Klesse","I suppose that if heavy oil gets deep enough discounted, you can offset some of the economic disadvantages of low cost natural gas and the other items at cokers. But we got to anticipate that ourselves.","Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley","Great. I appreciate guys. Thanks.","Operator","And we have Paul Cheng from Barclays.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Hey guys. Good morning. I have to apologize first because I came in late. So you may have already answered that question. Two question, one, that you are talking about 50% of the margin improvement is crude related and the 50% is imported and (inaudible). When we\u2019re looking at that if we\u2019re saying that, is there any tie-up of one-off operating benefit -- whether you have large volume of distressed crude coker that you\u2019ve been able to purchase that we have been saying that those are better not necessary repeatable into the first quarter or into 2014. Is there anything that you can quantify whether that\u2019s any meaningful among them?","Joe Gorder","I think we\u2019re looking at each other, Paul, and none of us -- nothing comes to mind like that.","Bill Klesse","Yeah. Nothing that\u2019s purely one-off benefit. We\u2019re always in the market looking for distressed cargos and those opportunities change from quarter-to-quarter but it wasn\u2019t -- in the fourth quarter, it wasn\u2019t an overwhelming and meaningful difference versus 3Q or year-over-year results, we are always getting that stuff.","Bill Klesse","On distressed but the discounts themselves were aligned.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Sure. But that is just the market condition. We\u2019ve just have been running extremely well and capturing the market. I\u2019m just talking about anything say somewhat you need and less likely to repeat one-of items on the operating side?","Bill Klesse","","No.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Okay. Second question is that when you are talking about increasing your light oil processing capability and which is what you\u2019re doing. Bill, have you also looked at your system, is there any real opportunity to maybe building some condensate splitter and use it fit into the system that is actually pacing light oil processing because I mean condensate is probably going to be even have a bigger discount.","Bill Klesse","So the answer to the question would be yes. We would look at something like that in the right circumstance. If we are sure, we can add value.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Bill, can you elaborate that, what kind of rising consensus, is that -- the current discount is just not big enough or the yield, or is this a really big investment that we are talking about?","Bill Klesse","Well, we\u2019d be bigger than one of our competitors announced for some other things that they\u2019ve done with the Marcellus or Utica. But permitting and there\u2019s a lot of other issues to come with this, so you have to be comfortable that these discounts will last long enough because the lead time is significant. But these are things that you would expect us to look at.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","Can you give us a roughly what kind of mandatory in terms of, one in metric quantity that you maybe talking about if it the right economic circumstances?","Bill Klesse","No. I don\u2019t have a good answer for you on the actual volume you are asking.","Paul Cheng - Barclays","I see. Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","And we have Allen Good from Morningstar.","Allen Good - Morningstar","A quick question on the impact of increase in light crude, you have in your recent presentation slide indicating that deferred yields had moved to 43% in 2015. Does that include all the light crude or projects associated with increasing light crude, or is there a risk there gasoline yields could actually be a little bit higher if you attain all those goals?","Ashley Smith","Allen, that includes what our expected runs are including those new projects. But depending on the margin environment, we are going to always optimize. So actual results could be different. But that\u2019s what was targeted in the overall runs based on our including projects.","Allen Good - Morningstar","And then just quick one on exports. Was there any additional markets that you identified during the quarter with respect to gasoline or [LED] imports or exports that you had previously exported to. I know previously you talked about picking up the market, the European had typically exported to. Was there any further additions there, or same straightforward countries that you\u2019ve typically exported to over the last year or two?","Bill Klesse","There were no material changes to any of the market and we are finding very, very consistent demand for gasoline in both South America and Europe. And gasoline, the bulk of our volume continues to move in Mexico and then into South America.","Operator","And we have no further questions.","Ashley Smith","Okay. Thank you, Sylvia. And appreciate the listeners for listening to our call today. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact Investor Relations. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. During the second quarter, we operated well and delivered solid financial results despite having turnarounds in our Gulf Coast and North Atlantic regions. We processed near record volumes of light sweet crude and we maximized heavy sour crude runs in our refineries as discounts widened to levels we haven't seen since 2014. We were positioned to take advantage of these discounts more fully due to our logistics investments including the Diamond Pipeline which enabled our Memphis refinery to capture additional margin from running WTI instead of LLS. And with relatively wide discounts for WTI versus Brent, our commitment on Enbridge Line 9B also provided meaningful margin benefits.","Looking ahead, work continues to move forward as planned on the Central Texas pipelines and terminals and the Pasadena products terminal with completion expected in 2019 and 2020. We expect the Sunrise Pipeline expansion to start-up in early 2019 which will provide our Mid-Continent region with even greater access to cost advantage Permian crude.","Turning to our refining investments, the Diamond Green Diesel capacity expansion is nearing completion and start-up is scheduled in August. Construction is also progressing on the Houston and St. Charles alkylation units and the Pembroke cogeneration plant. We expect these projects to be completed in 2019 and 2020.","With regard to cash returns to stockholders, we paid out 51% of our year-to-date adjusted net cash provided by operating activities and we continue to target an annual payout ratio between 40% to 50%.","Looking ahead, we continue to have an optimistic outlook for the balance of the year. Global economic activity remains healthy and product demand is strong domestically and internationally. Gasoline and distillate export volumes are steady. Days of supply of light products remain below five-year averages despite recent high industry refinery utilization rates. And while crude discounts have narrowed recently, the oil market remains well supplied and we expect differentials to widen again as the industry enters turnaround season.","And with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Thank you, Joe. For the second quarter, net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $845 million, or $1.96 per share, compared to $548 million, or $1.23 per share in the second quarter of 2017. Second quarter 2018 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $928 million, or $2.15 per share. For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to the financial tables that accompany this release.","Operating income for the refining segment in the second quarter of 2018 was $1.4 billion compared to $945 million for the second quarter of 2017. Excluding $21 million of other operating expenses primarily related to costs associated with the fire at the Texas City Refinery in April, adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2018 was $463 million higher compared to the second quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 is mostly attributed to higher distillate margins and wider discounts for sour and domestic sweet crudes versus Brent, partly offset by lower gasoline margins.","Refining throughput volumes in the second quarter of 2018 averaged 2.9 million barrels per day and throughput capacity utilization was 93%. Throughput volumes were 121,000 barrels per day lower than the second quarter of 2017 due to maintenance in the U.S. Gulf Coast and North Atlantic regions. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.67 per barrel were $0.11 per barrel higher than the second quarter of 2017, mainly due to lower throughput in the second quarter of 2018.","The ethanol segment generated $43 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $31 million in the second quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 was primarily due to higher distiller grains prices and stronger production volumes in the second quarter of 2018.","Operating income for the VLP segment in the second quarter of 2018 was $83 million compared to $71 million in the second quarter of 2017. The increase from 2017 was mostly attributed to contributions from the Port Arthur terminal assets and Parkway Pipeline, which were acquired in November of 2017.","For the second quarter of 2018, general and administrative expenses were $248 million and net interest expense was $124 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $523 million and the effective tax rate was 22%.","With respect to our balance sheet at quarter-end, total debt was $9.1 billion and cash and cash equivalents were $4.5 billion, of which $100 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt-to-capitalization ratio net of $2 billion in cash was 24%. At the end of June, we had $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash, of which $750 million was available for only VLP.","We generated $2.1 billion of cash from operating activities in the second quarter. Included in this amount is $581 million benefit from working capital. Excluding working capital, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion.","Moving to capital investments, which excludes acquisitions, we made $718 million of growth and sustaining investment in the second quarter. Included in the $510 million of sustaining expenditures was $270 million for turnaround and catalyst costs. The balance of capital invested in the quarter was for growth.","With regard to financing activities, we returned $672 million to our stockholders in the second quarter. $345 million was paid as dividends, with the balance used to purchase 2.8 million shares of Valero common stock. As of June 30, we had approximately $3.2 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We completed a $750 million public debt offering in May, and in June we repaid $750 million of senior notes due in 2019.","We continue to expect 2018 capital investments to total $2.7 billion, with about $1.7 billion allocated to sustaining the business and $1 billion to growth. Included in the total are turnarounds, catalysts, and joint venture investments.","Now for modeling our third quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges. U.S. Gulf Coast at 1.73 million to 1.78 million barrels per day, U.S. Mid-Continent at 430,000 to 450,000 barrels per day, U.S. West Coast at 270,000 to 290,000 barrels per day and North Atlantic at 445,000 to 465,000 barrels per day.","We expect refining cash operating expenses in the third quarter to be approximately $4 per barrel.","Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4 million gallons per day in the third quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.38 per gallon which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization.","For 2018, we continue to expect the annual effective tax rate to be about 22%. For the third quarter, we expect G&A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $215 million. Net interest expense is estimated at $110 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $515 million. Lastly, we continue to expect RINs expense for the year to between $500 million and $600 million.","That concludes our opening remarks. And before we open the call to questions, we would again respectfully request that our callers adhere to the protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&A to two questions. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits, as this will help us ensure all callers have time to ask their questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. How are you all?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess let's dive into the big question that's out there. Q2 was great. Q3 a year ago was really good. Q3 this year maybe doesn't look like it's starting off quite as strong, but if you can kind of walk us through maybe, Joe, how you see the market structure here as we look to the back half of the year. Maybe thoughts on turnarounds within the industry, where we are in terms of demand trends and then where you see, call it, crude access at this point given some of the issues out of nearby OPEC countries.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. Roger, that's great. We'll let Gary go ahead and take a whack at these.","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. Roger, I think you know on the diesel side, much like Joe commented in his opening remarks, demand remains very strong both domestically and to the export markets. Domestically, we're seeing about 125,000 barrels a day of demand growth. So despite the fact that we've had record high refinery utilization and distillate production that's above the five-year average range, we really haven't been able to replenish diesel inventories to pre-hurricane type levels. So we continue to see very low diesel inventories, very strong export demand and very strong domestic demand.","So moving forward into the third quarter, I think you see some production fall off as we get into turnaround season and refineries come down for turnarounds. And then, of course, as you get later in the year, you'd expect to see some improvement in demand as heating oil season kicks in with some colder weather. So, to me, I think diesel should even be stronger in the prompt market, but when you look at the fundamentals, I think we're in for a very strong diesel year.","On the gasoline side, again, gasoline demand looks good domestically and into the export markets. Here with the record-high refinery utilization and increase in gasoline production, gasoline production increases are outpacing the increases in demand a little bit, so we've been able to replenish gasoline inventories to kind of a pre-hurricane type level.","As we move forward in the gasoline markets, like diesel, I think you'll see production fall off some with turnaround season. But assuming you don't have some interruption in supply like we saw last year with the hurricanes, I would expect gasoline to follow more seasonal trends, and once you get through driving season through Labor Day and demand falls off a little bit, you'll see gasoline cracks weaken as we get into the fourth quarter.","On your crude question, we continue to see good availability in crudes despite declining production in Venezuela. We continue to get above our contract levels there. Seeing good supply from Canada. North American growth continues to exceed expectations and then we're starting to see more OPEC volume make its way to the United States as well.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So no problem on the crude side then?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","No.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Then just a quick follow-up. Guidance on cash OpEx if I understood was $4 a barrel. You've consistently done much better than $4 a barrel. So my question is simply, is there something going on expense wise? Or is this just closer to budget and if you perform better you come in lower on a per-barrel basis?","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. Roger, this is John. We take a view, right, as of a point in time and sometimes that changes over time. I think as you look at that number probably today, maybe there's \u2013 it's come off a little bit from there, but that is what the number is at the time we take the forecast.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So no major changes or anything that's changing sequentially, just part of the budgetary approach?","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Right.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys. My question is; you recently made some acquisitions in Peru on the biodiesel side. I'm just trying to understand if you could give us some more color on that acquisition? And would the earnings of that new segment or whatever acquisition you have made go through in the refining segment or the ethanol business?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. Good question. Rich, do you want to?","Richard F. Lashway - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, you bet. I'll answer this. So just to be clear, the acquisition here was not a renewable diesel acquisition. There's an idol renewable diesel plant there but it's been out of service for several years. This was really a wholesale marketing and terminal acquisition. We acquired two terminals that have in excess of 1.2 million barrels of storage, two truck racks, two offshore mooring facilities to offload product. So this is really set up to bring product into the country and not a renewable diesel play.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, it fits into our overall approach to securing shorts essentially in different international markets. We've got the activities that are taking place with Mexico, we've got now Peru, we've got other facilities that we're into today and we're looking at. But we've talked about being more involved in having access to the supply chain from the refineries out, and this acquisition just fits right into that. Essentially what we bought was a business, an operating business, and not a particular asset. So we feel pretty good about it, we also believe it's going to allow us to expand the business around that. We've got a team on the ground, obviously, right now working this, and their focus is, okay, we've got a strong market in Peru, where else are we going to take barrels that pass through this terminal.","Manav Gupta - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you so much, guys, for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I think this maybe is for Lane. Valero has continued to, seems like performing better and better in your refining operations. You've been consistently that I think outperform your throughput guidance even when you have some unplanned outages and all that, and that also seems like while you guys clearly are the leader here but the industry also doing better.","Lane, when we're looking at fundamentally, is it good reason other than, say, the pricing is good so everyone trying to run hot. Is there any other reason why that we've been despite more environmental standard, one would think that more stringent standards would make it more difficult for the industry to maintain a high run rate. Is there anything fundamental has shift?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Paul, this is Lane. Could you repeat that last couple of sentences, please.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well, I'm just trying to understand that, is it just because the commodity pricing is attractive so everyone is trying to run hotter, which is understandable. But other than that, is there anything fundamentally that make the industry be able to run their system much better than in the past?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","I think, generally, the industry has experienced through, whether it's through our shared understanding of via some things like Solomon, what good looks like and everybody's on their own individual journeys on how to get better in these spaces. And it's clearly been our focus to do that and we've improved our operation a great deal over the past 10 years, and we think we'll continue to improve. There's always room for improvement. But it's a focus to be safe and reliable, and obviously, environmentally compliant and all those things lend themselves to being a much more reliable operation.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Do you think that we have much more room to push on a sustainable basis to be better than what we have seen? I mean, it has been quite remarkable how well the industry has done.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. I'm not going to speak for the industry. I'll speak for Valero. Our real focus is to continue to minimize unplanned outages, and in particular to try to find ways to minimize our downtime, our turnaround downtime over an entire cycle, and make sure that our spend rates during that time is the right amount to achieve that. And that's really where we, in terms of going forward, that's where we see the most of our opportunity.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So you don't think that you max out yet?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","No.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Final one for me, Texas City, can you give us an update, the fire, when that is going to be back to normal operation? And also do you give any color about, I think previously talking about the coker investment?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","So, on the SCC question, the Texas City, the SCCs came back from current outlook, back to normal operation. The alkylation unit, we currently believe will sort of be mechanically restored at the end of August, so we'll resume full operation in the alky in early September.","With respect to the coker, we're just still working through the permitting process with all the stakeholders. We have to ultimately have an operating permit, a construction and operating permit to go forward, and really even to get in the position to make the final FID decision. I mean, and that's just the way our gating process works, so that's where we are.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Pleasure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Morning, Joe.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Morning, Doug.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Joe, you clearly are throwing off a great deal of cash, and obviously, we continue to admire the discipline at which you're returning cash to shareholders. So my question is kind of two-edged on that topic. And it is, why is 40% to 50% the right number? And given the substantial EBITDA you still hold at the parent company level, what's your latest thoughts on drop-down timing from an MLP standpoint? And I've got a macro follow-up, please.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Okay. Doug, good questions. Donna, you want to talk about the payout ratio.","Donna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.","Sure. On the capital allocation perspective, we just believe that 40% to 50% is the right balance between returning to the shareholder via cash in the dividend and share buybacks, but also preserving some cash back at the parent to reinvest in the company, that being in the form of sustaining capital, but also growth opportunities and acquisition opportunities.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So just to be clear, I guess, on the MLP question, if you did do some additional drop-downs, what would be the priority for the use of that cash? And, I guess, what I'm really getting at is the balance between the dividend and the buyback, do you see that changing at some point? Because, obviously, a lot of your rerating has been driven by, I think anyway, the move towards being more of a yield stock within the S&P. I'm just wondering if you can see a little bit more of a pivot back towards the dividend away from the buyback. And I do still have a micro follow-up, please.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. No, Doug. I mean, good question. On the drop-downs, I mean, the reality is that Valero receiving cash back via drop-downs, just hasn't materialize the way we all expected it to, and that's because the capital markets just aren't there for MLP equities today.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","I think MLP debt is okay. But, essentially, the way it's working out is Valero is the financier for VLP. And so as far as the cash perspective goes, there is no windfall of cash to be achieved for Valero by dropping down assets to VLP. It's the way the market is today. Will the market be this way in six months? I don't know, okay, but that's the way it is today. So there's not a big windfall of cash, I would say, to be had because of a drop-down opportunity.","We continue to look at the balance between the share repurchases and the dividend. And our basic view is let's get the dividend up to where we're paying out towards the high-end of the peer group, so that we're competitive there. And then, we use the share repurchases as a flywheel. The 40% to 50% range we give you is essentially our target. And to the extent that free cash flows exceed our expectations, we've used that flywheel than to go ahead and repurchase additional shares. And I think we're very comfortable with that and that's probably what we'll continue to do going forward. But rest assured that the dividend is something we talk about regularly. We are absolutely 100% committed to it. And whenever we make changes to it, we want to be sure that we're able to deal with it in good times and in bad times.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I appreciate the extended answer and, obviously, the arbitrage has closed some. So hopefully a quick follow up, Joe. I just wanted to close out the micro comments. It's an IMO question, I'm afraid, but there's obviously a great deal of uncertainty on how this is going to play out. And I just wanted to get your updated perspectives because it seems that bunker fuel associations and others around the world are starting to talk about what the real challenges are going to be of meeting the 1\/1\/20 date and particularly the pivot back towards scrubber options amongst other things. The example that's been cited is that delay of the water ballast rules that was pushed out two years because the industry was not ready. And I'm just curious if you've got a perspective as to how confident you are that things are going to transpire as optimistically, let's say, as some in the market are currently talking about. I'll leave it there. Thanks","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Doug, that's good, and we'll let Jason talk a little bit about IMO.","Jason Fraser - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, we've seen the same thing you have with a lot of discussion about how practical (25:19) implemented, whether the timeline's right. But at least our view now is we expect it to be implemented and enforced internationally according to there's timeline they put out without any big disruptions. The definitely hadn't made any indications to backing off at this time and if anything, they're working to put in place more effective enforcement mechanisms, like looking at whether you lose your insurance if you don't, it you violate the provisions or also potentially prohibiting vessels without scrubbers from transporting the higher sulfur material. But it is a big change.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Exxon Mobil, Jason, suggests that it might not be a bad idea to be the last man standing from a high sulfur fuel oil standpoint. Do you concur with that?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Gary, would you like to mention that one?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, I don't know. We don't make a lot of high sulfur fuel oil and I don't really see it that way. I think you're going to see a lot of people, as you get closer to 2020, to liquidate what inventory of high sulfur fuel oil that they have.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Morning, Phil.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Morning.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. The first question is just thinking ahead here with all the growth in U.S. light sweet crude production coming and, obviously, we have the Permian bottlenecks but those will be resolved, so all those barrels are going to be pointing towards the U.S. Gulf Coast and probably on the Houston side where you have a prime position. So how do you think about how that plays out? What might happen to discounts in the Gulf Coast and the export capabilities of the system today and where they're going?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah, Phil, this is Gary. I think, overall, it looks like most people are focused to tie a pipeline project with the dock project which allows the barrels to get to the water. I think you'll still have an advantage by being able to buy the barrels inland and buy the barrels on the Gulf Coast before they make their way to the water. But it looks like people are investing in logistics all the way to the water, not just to the Gulf.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So do you have a specific long-term view on like a Brent, Houston spread and what's reasonable based on transport?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","Yeah. So I think we look at it, did it cost anywhere from $0.50 to $2 to get the barrel on the water and then you have some transit cost to get the barrel actually to a market. And so that puts MEH to Brent spread somewhere in the $2 to $2.50 type range.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And then just a little bit of a follow-up to a prior question just on the heavy side. We have seen some tightening of, like, the LLS \u2013 Maya, LLS, Mars spread. So I'm just curious how you see that playing out for the rest of the year. You made the comments about the Middle East barrels coming back. So do you see a re-widening of that spread as we move into, call it, the fourth quarter?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","So I think I'll start with the heavy sour. So far, the Maya formula has really been impacted by the widespread in Brent\/TI and the volatility in that Brent\/TI spread. I think where we could get some relief on the heavy sour discounts is our view is as you move into the third and fourth quarter and you some turnaround activity in the Mid-Continent, you'll see some Cushing inventory begin to build which will allow the Brent\/TI spread to widen out. And as that does, the Maya formula would again be impacted. And so you could see the heavy sour discounts widen out some. Overall, I think to get big relief and see significant discounts in medium or heavy, you do need to get the OPEC production back on and so how fast the OPEC production ramps up will certainly have a big impact on those quality discounts.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Anything specifically on the mediums?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","No, I don't, today, you look in pretty much all the crude grades are trading at their quality-adjusted breakeven values. And so I think that holds until you see the OPEC barrels come back to the Gulf and then you could see those discounts widen back out. Today, at least the barrels we're taking from OPEC, the Saudi barrels that we're taking are going to the West Coast and so we haven't seen an incentive to reintroduce those barrels into the Gulf. But as they make their way back to the Gulf, then I think you start to see the medium sours widen back out.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Morning, Matt.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Morning.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Maybe to stick on this heavy sour theme, I think, Joe, in your opening comments, you talked about how you maximized heavy sour crude runs in the quarter. If I look at the data, your Gulf Coast system ran approximately 36% heavy plus resid in Q2. And then if we look way, way back to 2006, you ran approximately 51% heavy crude plus resid. I appreciate the system make-up has changed a little bit with Aruba and the crude toppers, but if you saw an environment with wider heavy dips over the next couple years, could you run more incremental heavies through your Gulf Coast system?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Hey, Matt. This is Lane. So I think one of the things you mentioned accurately is our portfolio is a little bit different than it used to be. In particular, we have the two topping units that run sweet and then also because of the clear margin that we've had on crude, like what Gary alluded to the answer in the last question was that you sort of have all the grades are on a quality basis equivalent. So it's really just been max crude rate. And so to the extent that refinery gets leveraged from that particular crude diet, it will maximize it. If you had us work \u2013 heavy sour was very, very disconnected and that was clearly the winner way over the other two, then we would run more heavy, we just may not run as much crude.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Sounds good. And then also want to circle back to the comment on how Line 9B from Enbridge provided some margin upside, just keeping in mind that Qu\u00e9bec had the big turnaround in the quarter. If you look at the EIA data, it seems to indicate that somebody is shipping WCS on Line 9B and then tankering it down and selling it to the Gulf Coast refineries. Is that a source of upside for Valero here?","Gary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.","It would be, but we didn't ship any heavy, and actually shipping heavy for us would be an issue because mainline, the Enbridge mainline is prorated and so actually being able to nominate heavy and ship it through Line 9B would be very difficult for us to do.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Morning, Craig.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Just wanted to expand on Doug's cash question and I think Donna's comment that you appropriately want to retain some powder dry for potential acquisitions and obviously growth projects. But the growth projects have been pretty stable, maybe about $1 billion annually, and think that you all have commented in the past the M&A market is not especially cheap. And cash flow certainly looked to be increasing second half over first on sequentially lower maintenance CapEx, prospects for improving cracks and then, of course, there's the outlook for IMO 2020 coming up. So my question is, is there a logical limit, an absolute limit to the size of the cash build as you kind of think of sticking to this 40% to 50% payout ratio over time?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","So historically \u2013 and I'll let Donna tail onto this however she would like \u2013 but historically we have said that we were going to stick to our capital allocation framework, which we have for four years now and we'll continue to do it going forward. But a component of that really has been the commitment also to not build significant cash positions. And if you look at it, I would tell you \u2013 and, John, you can tell me I'm wrong, but we've been between $4 billion and $5 billion of cash now for a number of quarters in a row.","John Locke - Valero Energy Corp.","Yes.","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","We set the target of 40% to 50% on the payout ratio. We've consistently raised the dividend. So our commitment to the shareholders on an absolute basis has gone up, and we'll continue to look at that going forward. But we're going to stick to this. We're not going to continue \u2013 we're not going to allow ourselves to run the cash balances way up. We think it's fair to our investors that if we are building cash, we're going to deploy it. And when it makes sense to deploy it to them versus investing it in projects within the business, we're going to do that.","Now, Lane and the team continue to develop projects. We executed on some acquisitions this quarter, which chewed up some cash. So, it's not all committed to share repurchases. We are using it to continue to grow the earnings capability of the business. But I think we're generally comfortable with the way we've been allocating it thus far.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I guess my question is \u2013 and I understand the cash balance has been relatively under control in recent quarters. But, I guess, if there's a break out as many people kind of envisioned for the industry in coming quarters in the next couple of years, how you might respond to that?","Joseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.","Well \u2013 and I think that our expectation would be that over the next bunch of quarters, we are going to see \u2013 and certainly as we get closer to 2020, we should see significant increases in our free cash flow as a result to the IMO 2020, and we're going to maintain our commitment to our capital allocation framework through that process. Now, does that mean higher dividends? Could well be. Does it mean additional share repurchases? Could well be. We don't want to abort our disciplined process to executing capital projects. Okay?","Lane and the team have done an outstanding job over the last several years of really getting their arms around this and being sure that we knew what the project was going to cost and what we expected the returns to be before we made the commitments to it. To the extent you try to accelerate that, you potentially degrade that process and we really would prefer not to do that. So, if we have an abundance of cash, acquisitions may look better. Share repurchases will still be certainly probably a big part of our use of cash and potential dividend increases.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great.

But what was actually kind of the impact on earnings in terms of kind of the lost opportunity from that outage during the quarter?","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi. This is Lane. So, our lost opportunity due to the outage during the second quarter was $150 million.","Peter Low - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.","Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey. Just one quick follow-up here. So, you have a couple of projects around expanding your alkylation capacity, and I was hoping you could just provide an update on where you stand regarding the EBITDA contribution potential from those projects. It looks like octane spreads have widened a little bit year-over-year, although we're nowhere near where we were, say, back in 2015. So, in general, do you expect that Tier 3 would reduce octane supply and maybe rising fuel economy standards would increase octane demand? Just any comments on that would be great.","R. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.","Hi. So, Matt, this is Lane. You sort of answered the question, I believe. The Houston alky, we're still going to start-up in the first half of next year. Our strategic view on that is is that octane will get more valuable as we go forward via Tier 3 destroying octane and then, obviously, the fuel economy standards. And then, really, this increasing wide arbitrage between NGL and gasoline, or transportation fuel. So we still feel good about those. Our FID EBITDA at the time was $105 million. We're not going to \u2013 that's the number. We're not going to provide any other color with respect to sort of a forward market or even a prompt market view on that.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay.

Please note this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Locke. Mr. John (sic) [Mr. Locke] (00:21), you may begin.","John Locke - Vice President\u2013Investor Relations","Good morning, and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Ciskowski, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Lane Riggs, our Executive Vice President of Refining Operations and Engineering; Jay Browning, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and several other members of Valero's senior management team.","If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at Valero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we described in our filings with the SEC.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joe for a few opening remarks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter presented us with challenging markets with gasoline and diesel margins under pressure for most of the quarter. The bright spot was the performance of our team, as we continued to operate safely and reliably. What I'd like to do this morning is take a few minutes to discuss our strategic initiatives that we believe will continue to drive long-term value creation and then share some color on what we are singing in the markets.","First, at the core of everything we do is a relentless focus on safety and reliability. Our dedication and persistence here is what keeps our people and community safe, our operations reliable, our cash operating costs the lowest among the peer group. Having low-cost operations is a major advantage in our industry where product margins can be quite volatile. As a disciplined operator, we are able to run profitably in a lower margin environment as experienced in the first quarter.","Second, we apply discipline and rigor, as we evaluate and execute investments that will grow the profitability and competitiveness of our business for many years. The strategic plan that was approved by our board of directors last year included $2.6 billion of capital spending for 2016. Approximately $1 billion was allocated to strategic investments to drive long-term earnings growth.","Third, we are committed to delivering value to stockholders by making the right investments in our business and returning cash to our stockholders. We demonstrated this in 2015 when we delivered the highest total stockholder return among our peers for both Valero and VLP. We expect VLP to continue to be well positioned to execute its distribution growth strategy through 2017 despite volatile capital markets.","We also continue to keep an eye on M&A. We review opportunities and we have a list of targets that we consistently monitor. We consider M&A a discretionary use of cash, so there's a healthy tension when evaluating M&A opportunities versus other alternative uses. Of course, we can't comment specifically on M&A, but we are diligently reviewing opportunities. For cash returns in 2016, which is made up of dividends and buybacks, we've extended our 2015 payout target of 75% of net income. In January, we increased the quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.60 a share, but we remain focused on maintaining a dividend payout at the high end of our peer group. We're confident in Valero's ability to fund investments in future growth and to meet its payout target.","Lastly, let me share some color on the current market. Already this year, we've been in a lot of conversations about various market topics including gasoline demand resurgence, octane strength, diesel length, domestic crude supply, and crude storage levels. As you know, markets for Valero's feedstocks and products are dynamic. Our high complexity refineries, system flexibility, advantage locations, and low cash cost operations enable us to maximize earnings under challenging market conditions.","On the crude supply side, we are seeing more medium sour crudes coming into the market. As a result, we are seeing healthy medium and heavy sour crude discounts. We also have greater access to domestic sweet crudes with the logistics build out in the U.S., allowing domestic production to clear the Mid-Continent region and reach the large Gulf Coast refining center.","On the demand side, continued GDP growth and low product prices should continue to support demand. In the U.S., we are seeing gasoline demand continue to grow. We are encouraged by increased vehicle miles traveled and double-digit percentage increases in SUV and truck purchases in the U.S. and key countries around the globe. Distillate demand globally was good, albeit in the U.S. it's been fairly flat. While distillate margins were pressured near term due to unseasonably warm weather in North America and Europe, distillate demand in Latin America remains robust.","Overall, we still have structural refined product supply challenges in South America and the developing countries, which we don't expect to be resolved in the near term. With our low-cost Gulf Coast refining presence, we have the ability to compete in markets all over the globe. We also have the opportunity to optimize our system and supply in the Atlantic basin with our refineries in Wales and Qu\u00e9bec City. In fact, we generated another quarter of solid distillate and gasoline export volumes.","In summary, we still have significant crude supply, ample natural gas availability and growing global petroleum demand that's outpacing refining capacity additions. We don't see this changing anytime soon, so although the markets will be challenging at times, the longer term macro outlook remains favorable.","So, with that, John, I'll hand the call back to you.","John Locke - Vice President\u2013Investor Relations","Thank you, Joe. Moving on to the results, net income was $495 million or $1.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016. Excluding an after-tax lower of cost or market inventory valuation benefit of $212 million or $0.45 per share, we reported first quarter 2016 adjusted net income of $283 million or $0.60 per share. This compares to $964 million or $1.87 per share for the first quarter of 2015.","For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts, please refer to page six of the financial tables that accompany our release. Adjusted operating income for the refining segment in the first quarter of 2016 was $695 million or $946 million lower than in the first quarter of 2015. Margins were pressured downward primarily due to weaker distillate margins given high refinery run rates across the industry, product inventory builds and unseasonably warm weather.","Other headwinds on refining margins included narrower domestic light sweet crude oil discounts versus the Brent benchmark, low fuel oil and petrochemical product margins, and elevated costs for RINs credits. Low crude oil prices continue to drive slowdowns in North American drilling and production, which coupled with an excess of pipeline takeaway capacity in the Mid-Continent region led to tighter discounts for crude oils relative to Brent. Low energy cost supported by robust North American natural gas production partly offset these factors.","Our refineries operated at 96% throughput capacity utilization in the first quarter of 2016 and throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day, which was 169,000 barrels per day higher than in the first quarter of 2015. Refining cash operating expenses of $3.55 per barrel were $0.40 per barrel lower than the first quarter of 2015 mostly due to higher throughput volumes and lower energy costs.","The ethanol segment earned $9 million of adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $12 million in the first quarter of 2015. The low crude oil and gasoline price environment challenged ethanol margins, but with the recent recovery in prices, ethanol margins had modestly improved to start the second quarter.","For the first quarter of 2016, general and administrative expenses excluding corporate, depreciation were $156 million. Net interest expense was $108 million. Depreciation and amortization expense was $485 million, and the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was 30%. The effective tax rate was lower than the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to higher relative earnings contribution from international operations with lower statutory tax rates.","Regarding our balance sheet, at quarter end, we had $7.3 billion of total debt and $3.8 billion of cash and temporary cash investments, of which $102 million was held by VLP. Valero's debt to capitalization ratio, net of $2 billion in cash, was 20%. We had $5.5 billion of available liquidity excluding cash, of which $575 million was only available to VLP.","Cash flows in the first quarter included $479 million of capital investments, of which $161 million was for turnarounds and catalyst. For 2016, we expect to invest $1.6 billion of capital to sustain the business and $1 billion for refining asset optimization and logistics to drive long-term earnings growth.","With respect to our refining growth strategy, the new Corpus Christi crude unit, which was completed late last year, operated as planned and delivered approximately $35 million of EBITDA in the first quarter. We completed the St. Charles hydrocracker expansion in March, and the new Houston crude unit is on track to start up in the second quarter. The Houston alkylation project, which was approved in January, is now undergoing detailed engineering and procurement. Completion of the alkylation unit is expected in the first half of 2019.","Moving to the financing activities, we returned $547 million in cash to our stockholders in the first quarter, which included $282 million in dividend payments and $265 million for the repurchase of 3.8 million shares of Valero common stock. We had $1.1 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization as of March 31, 2016. Our regular quarterly cash dividend is now $0.60 per share. We continue to target a payout of 75% of annual net income for 2016.","For modeling our second quarter operations, we expect throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.59 million barrels per day to 1.64 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 430,000 barrels per day to 450,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 260,000 barrels per day to 280,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 450,000 barrels per day to 470,000 barrels per day.","Refining cash operating expenses are estimated at approximately $3.75 per barrel for the second quarter. Based on today's market prices, we expect costs relating to meeting our biofuel blending obligations to be between $750 million and $850 million for 2016. This is primarily related to RINs in the U.S.","The ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 3.8 million gallons per day. Operating expenses should average $0.37 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for depreciation and amortization. G&A expenses for the second quarter, excluding corporate depreciation, are expected to be approximately $165 million and net interest expense should be about $110 million. Total depreciation and amortization expense is estimated at $465 million and our effective tax rate is expected to be 31%.","This concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, we respectfully request that callers limit each turn in the Q&A to two questions. This will help us ensure that other callers have time to ask their question. If you have more than two questions, please rejoin the queue as time permits.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. From Goldman Sachs, we have Neil Mehta. Please go ahead, sir.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Neil.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Joe, you made reference to seeing opportunities in the M&A market in your opening comments. Of course, recognize that you can't comment on anything specific but can you talk about either scale, large-scale or small-scale, or whether those opportunities are more midstream-focused versus refining focused?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Neil, I'll provide some color here in a second, but let me let Mike go ahead and speak to this.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Neil, we're looking at the opportunities that are available to us both on the refining and the midstream side. We do have a target list as Joe alluded in his comments. Some of those are corporate-related, some of those are asset-related. So, I can't provide any more specifics than that at this point.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, Neil, when we look at these though, I mean obviously you want to try to find opportunities where you can buy good assets and where you can achieve synergies in it. And that's certainly true on the refining side. I'll just be honest right now, there's not a whole lot that's being shown to us, but we do have our target list and there are a few conversations that are taking place.","Then on the M&A side, it's like Mike said, I think if you think in terms of the type of deal we're going to do, it's not likely going to be some kind of large corporate deal. It's not going to be a step-out deal, but it will be more asset-focused and perhaps in the context of a partnering arrangement with people that were looking at transactions or want somebody to share in their pipe. So nothing super hot right now, though.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate that, guys. And then secondly, on the distillate market, you made a reference to the fact that it is tough out there in terms of the margins for distillates. And part of that was weather, but part of it seems to be both supply and demand for the product. How do you see that going forward through the balance of the year and then can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the export market for distillate and if that's ultimately the flywheel that can help rebalance the market?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Okay, Neil. This is Gary. Yeah, I think what we've seen on distillate, we came out of winter with a lot of overhang in distillate inventory as you alluded to. And then on the demand side, you get into March and demand was way off and we've certainly seen for the past several weeks, demand continue to creep up. We've seen some good agricultural demand begin to kick in and so we've trended to where we're now more towards the five-year high, actually last week above the five-year high. So I think some of this demand will help clean up the inventory.","And then also, you talked about the exports. We're seeing lot of good opportunities to export distillate as well, so the combination of the two of those things, I think, will help keep domestic inventories in check. Moving forward, I think as flat price continues to rise, you'll start to see some recovery in the upstream sector, which should improve distillate demand as well. But really we'll have to wait and see if we have a more normal winter this winter and that'll be a key driver in terms of what happens with the distillate fracks moving forward.","Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Neil.","Operator","From Howard Weil, we have Blake Fernandez. Please go ahead.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Hey, guys. Good morning. I was hoping to get a little color on your thoughts around the drop-down targets. I believe you have a $1 billion target. I think year-to-date you've done about $240 million, but just in light of kind of some of the challenges we're seeing in the midstream, can you just share your thoughts around how you're thinking about that $1 billion target this year?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Blake, sure. This is Mike. Before we get into that target, though, let me start off by talking about the capital markets. VLP does not need to execute any drops to meet its 25% distribution growth through 2017. So VLP does not need to access the capital markets. That being said, we believe the capital markets, both debt and equity, are open for MLPs, particularly high-quality MLPs like VLP. The cost of issuing debt or equity, however, remains more expensive than historical levels.","The good news was VLP is well positioned with strong distribution coverage and does not need access to the capital markets from this price environment. Therefore, we are going to revise our drop-down guidance to $500 million to $750 million. We can execute drops in this range without going to the capital markets. We are going to continue to prepare for $1 billion in drops and will be ready to execute $1 billion in drops if the capital markets improve.","From a Valero Energy perspective, regardless of whether or not we drive $500 million or $1 billion worth of assets this year to VLP, this amount will not materially change our view on our payout guidance.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it. Okay. Thank you, Mike. That's helpful. The second question and this may tie in a little bit with Neil's M&A question, but the amount of, I guess, capital returned to shareholders, $547 million, is well above your adjusted earnings, so you're obviously well on track with that net income target. Obviously 1Q is a little weak, so maybe you see some improving earnings going forward? But I'm just curious if you were to identify some M&A opportunities, does that materially change your thought on this 75% net income target?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would only say that we would have to look at that at the time of the acquisition. I mean, if it was a huge acquisition that might require some equity, then obviously we'd have to rethink about the buyback target. But it's going to be \u2013 right now I'm going to say no, but depending on the size of it, it could.","Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","From Barclays, we have Paul Cheng. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I think the first one is for Joe and maybe then for Mike actually. On the financial strategy, I mean are you guys actively looking at and evaluating opportunity on M&A? From that standpoint, Mike and Joe, should we be more maybe conservative on the bond shape and maybe put some of the free cash flow back on the cash so that you will be ready when the opportunities strike?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Our balance sheet, Paul, is very, very strong. We want to keep it that way, but it's very strong. I think right now rather than building cash, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to grow our business and our EPS.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, you know, Paul, I mean you saw the cash balance that we've got. As Mike said, our leverage levels are very low. We came through a tough quarter with this balance sheet. So I think we are pretty well positioned and I would tell you, though, if there was a significant M&A transaction out there, we would do the right thing as you would expect us to do and perhaps build some cash before we executed the transaction.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. The second question, maybe this is for either Gary or Lane. In the first quarter, your system-wide margin capture rate versus your benchmark is about 62%. In the first quarter last year, it's about 70%, and your average in 2015, 2014 is about 72% and 67%. So, just curious that in the first quarter this year, there much lower margin capture rate. How much is related to just the different pricing environment in the macro fund and how much is related to more company-specific reason? Any kind of insight would be great.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Hey, Paul, this is Gary. I can start with, I guess it's hard to go into a lot of detail on the capture rates here, so certainly invite you to follow up with Karen and John after the call, but on some high-level things, I can tell you in terms of volume variance, there really wasn't a negative impact on volume variance for refineries. Actually, we would show that the volume variance was slightly positive for the quarter. So, what you are seeing on the capture rates is all market-driven. At a high level, there's a few things I would point to. The higher cost RINs certainly had an impact on our capture rates. The butane differential, the gasoline was much more narrow in the first quarter than what we saw last year that had an impact on the capture rates.","In the North Atlantic basin, when you look at our crude cost relative to Brent, the narrower Brent-TI arb impacted our crude cost most importantly at Qu\u00e9bec. Also the Western Canadian crudes, the Syncrudes were more expensive in the first quarter, so the volumes coming off Line 9, so we had a crude cost impact to our North Atlantic basin system. And the only thing that's really operationally we had the Benecia cat down on the West Coast for a planned turnaround, and so our capture rates there were down a little bit as well, but those are some of the real key factors.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Gary, can I have a quick follow-up. On the second quarter, your turnaround activity, is it focusing on the conversion unit or that is crude unit?","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Hey, Paul, this is Lane. We don't give second quarter guidance with respect to what kind of capacity we'll have in turnaround, so.","Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Will do. Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Phil Gresh. Please go ahead.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Phil.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question on the Gulf Coast, your crude slate clearly shifted more towards mediums. On your slide deck, you have given a range historically for heavies of about 24% to 37% over time, and you were at the low end of that range 24% in the first quarter. That's actually down year-over-year, so I know you talked about the medium and heavy discounts becoming available. Were there any one-time factors that led you to have actually lower heavies in the quarter or just generally how are you thinking about crude slate as we progress through the year?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Yeah, Phil, this is Gary. A couple of things, the way we report our results, we have the heavy sour crudes shown, but we also have a category we show resids, and some of those resids are actually replacements for heavy sour crudes in our system. We run the resids through our crude unit, and so where the heavy sour crudes were down, actually the resids we processed were up. So there really wasn't a significant difference in the amount of heavy sour crude we ran in the first quarter.","In terms of the range, some of the things that we talk about, it's not just the discounts that we are looking at, there is a rate lever associated with really pushing heavy sour crudes in our system. If we want to maximize heavy sour crudes, they generally mean we are running at lower throughput, so we have to look at the discounts and also where the crack spreads are, and then we do that optimization.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Follow-up question just on the M&A front. With respect to refining to the extent you are looking there, could you just remind us how you think about regionally where you'd want to be adding exposure?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, if you look at areas that we feel that we could grow, okay, and I'm doing this from just historical looks at different assets and how the FTC might view something, the West Coast, California in particular, will be very, very difficult for us. We are not really focused there. The East Coast, we've exited and so we're not interested there. The Mid-Con, I think we would be good to go on transactions and we'd be interested in there and then of course U.S. Gulf Coast. And when we look at the acquisitions, we look at them from a perspective of where can we create the greatest synergies.","And with the portfolio of assets that we have in the U.S. Golf Coast, we believe that we can create synergies around feedstocks and product movements there perhaps better than anywhere else now. So, that would be the U.S. side. If we go over to Europe, I think we'd be interested in assets in markets like the UK where we've got a presence today and we could bolt something on and support it out of the London office. We're not interested in a lot of the countries in Western Europe just because of the nature of the assets and then the issues that go along with owning assets in those markets. And then I really think from our perspective, the Far East is off the table. So, in a nutshell, the U.S. Gulf Coast would be interesting, the Mid-Continent of the U.S. would be interesting, the UK would be interesting, and that would be our primary focus.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just sneak one last one in on RINs? Do you have what the actual RINs cost was in the first quarter of this year relative to first quarter of last year?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we probably do.","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, $161 million versus $133 million last year.","Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Take care, Phil.","Operator","From Wells Fargo, we have Roger Read. Please go ahead, sir.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Roger.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess let me jump into the gasoline demand, obviously positive comments to start it off. Now that we're getting into the early part of summer driving season, summer grade gasoline, how is the octane market shaping up? Are we seeing significant supplies, any shortages in any particular regions? And just how you look at that as we roll through the rest of the second quarter?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Hey, Roger. This is Gary. I think we're seeing a very similar situation in regards to octane what we've seen the last couple of years. Octane's starting to get tight, so we saw the regrade in the Mid-Continent strengthen significantly. The premium regrade on the West Coast has also strengthened considerably in the last couple of weeks, so I think the industry's short of octane and we'll see similar regrades to what we've been seeing in the past few years.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, no reason to think there's any sort of surplus octane out there at all at this point?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","It doesn't appear that way to me.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on your comment on the diesel demand side, underpinned by the agricultural seasonality. I assume that backs off somewhat as we roll into the middle of the summer. Do you see any other places in the market where demand has picked up or has at least solidified versus where it was in the wintertime?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","I think going forward the thing we're looking at is our exports. And so you look to us and yesterday the JBC global refining margin showed Northwest Europe simple capacity at like $0.23 margin, so it doesn't take diesel falling off much before some of that low complexity capacity has to cut and as they cut, it'll open up even greater opportunities for us to export our barrels moving forward.","Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Paul Sankey. Please go ahead, sir.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, everyone. I'm not quite sure what I was called just there and I'm not going to repeat it.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Paul, it's better than probably some of the things you've been called.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, Joe. Appreciate that.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Just kidding. (30:42) All right, Paul.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Joe, you came in as CEO very clearly talking about cash return, a big jump in the dividend. I'm not quite sure why today you're suddenly saying you're going to buy stuff. If I missed something, is that mostly for VLP that you're talking about or is this a change in tone? And further to that, the macro follow-up, it seems like we got a really good environment in terms of demand and everything else out there, particularly for you guys with the heavy\/light spreads and stuff, heavy sour. Why are margins not better and is that related to oversupply, do you think, which would further underline that you wouldn't want to be growing in this market? You would want to be shrinking. Thanks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Well, I'll go first. You know, Paul, I'd say M&A is something that we've had in our capital allocation framework for the last two years and that really hasn't changed. Now it seems like you and your peers are the ones that are interested in that perhaps more than we are. When we look at our approach to trying to drive EPS growth over the next three years to five years, it's really multifaceted and it includes growth investments in refining and midstream.","We also look at M&A and we look at share repurchases and we've got a really good pipeline of refining projects that are under development. Now we don't want to get out over our skis, so we don't really discuss the specifics on these projects that are in development until we've gone further down the approval process. But we do have a bunch of great projects that exceed the 25% IRR hurdle rate that we've talked about and we'll try to do as many of those projects as we find. Midstream investments are of interest. They've got a lower hurdle rate, as you would expect, but they will drive earnings growth through optimization, so these are critical to us also. Then when we look at the discretionary uses of cash, M&A fits into that category for us.","And really what I just want to communicate on that is that the assets that we would look at there, Paul, would be those that create synergy and would be accretive to the company. We've got a great portfolio today and we do have that tension between the use \u2013 the discretionary use of cash via this framework that we put in place and we are not going to do an acquisition, and that's why you've seen we haven't pulled the trigger, we're not going to do an acquisition if we believe it's more accretive to do a share repurchase. So anyway return of cash to shareholders hasn't lost its priority at all from our perspective. It's just we are looking at that, growth projects and M&A as a competitive use of funds. So, with that, Gary, you want to answer the (30:47)?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","(30:48)","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Well, I guess, Joe, just to quickly throw in a follow-up. You're still running with the share of net income target paid out, I guess?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right. That's right.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","And then, do we think \u2013 are we oversupplied in this market? Is that why margins are not better for what should be seemingly a much better environment?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Yeah, I think so. You have a couple of key factors. We keep pointing down the distillate side. The warmer weather in the United States and Northwest Europe certainly hindered these demands coming through the winter and so it created this overhang we are living with today. I think the other thing that happened is the combination of relatively strong frack spreads in December and January incentivized higher utilization than what we typically see. In combination, the strong carry in the market and refiners that typically aren't running high utilizations in December and January, running high utilizations and selling their product forward, so those things kind of all contributed to build some inventory and it will just take us a little while to work that inventory off.","Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC","Understood. Very quick follow-up. Could you just update us on the impact what you're seeing in Venezuela in terms of if there is impact there and what sort of lost volumes there are? And I'll leave it at there. Thank you.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Paul.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Yeah, so, Venezuela was very important piece of our crude supply situation. We've had a very good longstanding relationship with PDVSA. What we've seen is we really haven't seen a decrease in oil coming out of the country. What we have seen is with some of the rolling power outages that they've had, that the grades of oil are changing so we are seeing a greater percentage of diluted crude oils and less of some of the synthetic crude oils into our system, but our system is robust enough to be able to absorb that, so we buy those barrels and continue to run them into our system.","Operator","From Simmons, we have Jeff Dietert. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Joe, in your initial comments, you talked about seeing more medium sours on the market and we are seeing that roll through the DoE statistics historically for January and February. I was hoping you could comment on some of the recent press releases that have highlighted increased supply coming out of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and some of the other Middle Eastern countries. Are you seeing increases of volumes coming from the Middle East coming into the market?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jeff. Let Gary answer this. He's in the market every day.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Yeah, Jeff, so we certainly are seeing that. I think on the Iranian barrels, of course we don't run any Iranian barrels, but what we've seen there is kind of some rebalancing in the market, so some of those barrels are making their way into Europe and we're seeing some of the Russian Urals come back into the U.S. market that we haven't seen here for a while. And then, yes, we are certainly seeing a lot more Saudi barrels flowing this way. We had decreased our Saudi volumes, but as they continue to put barrels on the market and they are competitive, we are ramping those back up on our system as well.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","And are you seeing a shift towards an increase in imported crude versus domestic crude? Just kind of confirming. U.S. Lower 48 volumes down 670,000 barrels a day from peak and imports increasing, it seems most of that is Middle East, LAM, and Canada.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Yes, I agree. What you're really seeing is a substitution somewhat of domestic light sweet for Middle East medium sours. We've seen sometimes where the arb is opened to import foreign light sweets, but that doesn't seem open very long. Same way. There is an occasional pop where the market goes, where incentivized exports of U.S. crude, but again that doesn't seem to last very long. The big switch has been a domestic light sweet for a Middle East medium sour.","Jeffery Alan Dietert - Simmons & Company International","Thanks for your comments.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","From Citigroup, we have Faisel Khan. Please go ahead.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, good morning, guys.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi Faisel.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Just two questions. First on the gasoline margins, the realized margins between the Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic \u2013 or sorry, Mid-Continent, if I look at the markers for the quarter, certainly in the Mid-Continent, the diesel and gasoline minus TI margins were higher than the Gulf Coast gasoline and ULSD minus Brent margins, but the realized margins in the Gulf Coast are much higher, so I just want to make sure I understand sort of what's taking place there with the Gulf Coast realized margins being higher versus the Mid-Continent despite the product market being more profitable in the Mid-Continent, and I know you guys had some run cuts.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","So, are you looking on a comparative basis quarter-over-quarter or are you just...?","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","No. Just in the quarter between regions. The Mid-Continent gasoline minus TI crack was stronger than the Gulf Coast gasoline minus Brent crack, but on a realized basis, it was still much stronger in the Gulf Coast than the Mid-Continent.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Yeah, so, I would say probably the key thing that contributed to that is that the Mid-Continent just had very, very high inventories. And so, in order to move product out over our wholesale racks, we were actually having to discount product in order to clear the refineries and so it lowered our realized kind of crack capture.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that makes sense. And then on light\/heavy differentials, it looks like recently, just in the last week or two, the differentials sort of narrowed a little bit. Just wondering what you're seeing there despite sort of the talk of more availability of heavy sour crudes in the market.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Yeah, I think the thing that happened there is really the K and the Maya formula changed, and at the same time it changed, the Brent-TI arb came in and fuel oil strengthened a little bit, and so it really made it to where Maya isn't pricing competitive with medium sour alternatives or really even pricing competitive with Canadian alternatives into the Gulf, which tells me the Maya formula is going to have to change again and the Maya discount will have to widen going forward.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks for the time, guys.","Operator","From Tudor, Pickering, Holt, we have Chi Chow on the line. Please go ahead.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Chi.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hi. Your throughput guidance for 2Q felt a little bit light across all the regions. Was that turnaround-related or more economic-related decisions?","John Locke - Vice President\u2013Investor Relations","Yeah, Chi, this is John. We can't talk about forward turnarounds, but I mean we take a view of turnaround activity and then also markets to plan our throughputs.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then I am not exactly sure this is an M&A question specifically or more a broader U.S. market question, but it feels like the breakup of Motiva is potentially a significant development in the domestic downstream market. Kind of how do you assess these opportunities and maybe even the risk associated with that event?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, okay. I don't know that I've assessed it the way you're asking. I mean we understand that they had a partnership that they wanted to both exit and they decided to do that. I think Saudi is pleased with the assets that they got in the deal and Shell is pleased with the assets that they have in the deal, and that's really all we know about that one to be quite honest. I do not view this transaction, though, as a precursor to a whole series of other major similar type of transactions in the U.S., Chi. I just don't \u2013 we're not hearing it and we're not seeing it.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Do you think Aramco is looking to take more refining capacity here? And will the government even allow that, do you think?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I can't \u2013 I'd only be speculating and I really don't have an opinion on it. Again, I think they'd have to find something that was for sale if they wanted to engage and I just don't know if there's a significant portfolio of assets out there that they could get into.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks, Joe. Appreciate that.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You bet. Sorry, Chi.","Chi Chow - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yeah, no. It's...","Operator","From Cowen & Company, we have Sam Margolin. Please go ahead.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","So, on U.S. crude exports, you touched on it for a second, windows not open all that often. But you're still seeing some upstream companies talk about it. There've been a couple of press releases. Have you seen any effect? And I ask in the context of the Corpus Christi topper, which sounds like it had a pretty good result in the quarter and doesn't seem really affected by either diffs or single cargoes exiting the Gulf whenever temporary windows open.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Yeah, this is Gary again. I don't think we've really seen any significant impact of the exports on any of our operations.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And that's sort of like \u2013 so the topper performance is essentially in line, you think, sort of operating with expectations in the current environment? Are there any commodity factors that are dynamic that affect that, if it's not differentials?","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Hey, Sam. This is Lane. We started up in December our funding investment decision, which was about $150 million of EBITDA. If you use 2015 pricing, it made about $200 million and if you look at the last quarter, we're estimating it contributed about $35 million. So it's in line with our funding decision, and then Gary spoke to the market on it, so that's where the project sort of fits.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Any other factors that are affecting it?","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Well, you have commodity risk all over the place. I think when we analyze a project, the one that we always stare at the most is naphtha. The Gulf has long naphtha with crude in it backed out resid purchases and so we always have a keen eye on the placement of naphtha that's created due to both of these projects, both the Corpus Christi and the Houston crudes. That's where I would say the greatest commodity risk is.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And I hate to harp on M&A because I recognize the opportunity to give color is limited, but I just wanted to touch on something you said about the Gulf Coast and ask about any regulatory elements we should know about. It sounds if the FTC is sort of pretty generous with these market share requirements or if it would be a little tougher?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, Sam, I never really heard anybody use generous and FTC in the same context, but I would describe them as a very reasonable group quite honestly and we've had a lot of dealings with them over the years as we've done acquisitions. I believe that what they would look at not only for Valero but for anybody is your ability to restrict trade in a particular market. And because the Gulf Coast is so long and so oversupplied and the barrels tend to move throughout the U.S. and abroad, you're not going to run into a situation whereby having a more significant concentration in the Gulf Coast, you could run into a situation where you could manipulate markets, it just wouldn't be possible. So, anyway, I really don't think they'd have a problem with additional Gulf Coast exposure for Valero.","Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks so much.","Operator","From Credit Suisse, we have Ed Westlake. Please go ahead.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, guys. Good morning. A couple of small ones. Just on the comment you said seeing a lot more OPEC barrels coming this way, is that a recent change or is that just a general comment around sort of the first quarter and market conditions? I'm just specifically thinking about the failure of Doha and whether that has sort of brought any more assertiveness into the marketing of these barrels to you given you're a big medium and heavy consumer?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","I think we have seen a strategic shift that the Saudis have made an effort to regain the market share they lost to a lot of the domestic crude producers and they're exporting a lot more barrels to the U.S. Gulf Coast, and we certainly saw that in the first quarter and we expect it will continue.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just then on the Gulf Coast, I mean you've got these toppers coming up, so that's adding to capacity and yet your sort of guidance was just a little bit soft. I mean just maybe is it the startup of those CDUs within the quarter?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Throughput guidance.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Throughput guidance, yeah.","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","So, Ed, I'll take a stab at this. I mean John sort of alluded to it. There's an \u2013 they're \u2013 both of the crude units are running in \u2013 the Corpus Christi crude unit is running in the second quarter and the Houston crude unit starts up in the second quarter. All the rest of the volume guidance is related to other activities and with our market outlook and the capacity that we plan to run with.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then on the RIN size, just we've obviously got the costs and we'll do the calculation, but are you drawing down any inventories? I mean folks are getting perhaps even more concerned about RIN prices into 2017 given the mandate and where your inventory position of the refining industry will be. Obviously there's an election between now and then, but maybe some color as to what \u2013 if everything was unchanged, what sort of inflation you might see in that RIN cost into 2017?","Martin Parrish - Vice President-Alternative Fuels","Yeah, this is Martin Parrish. I think a lot of it \u2013 there's quite a bit of stock to pull down on the RIN, so we'll see it and we still don't have clear sight of what's going to be called for in 2017. So I think right now it's a little early to say. It's been kind of remarkably stable for the last few months, RIN prices, so we'll see.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then final small one, you mentioned that you thought the waterborne octane components have been cleared up at this point. Maybe just some extra color, I mean we do hear anecdotes of (44:30) cargoes floating around, which would make limited sense to me.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Yeah. So we heard the same thing, that there was a lot of cargoes, especially parked off New York Harbor. Our understanding is a lot of that has actually come in over the last couple of weeks. And as I mentioned, we're actually seeing the premium regrade start to widen, which kind of contradicts this idea that there is all this octane laying around.","Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. And typically it widens more in May, so we'll watch that closely. Okay. Thanks very much.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","From RBC Capital Markets, we have Brad Heffern. Please go ahead.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Brad.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Joe and I guess maybe for Gary too, in the opening remarks, you talked about how strong export \u2013 or product export demand has continued to be. Can you dive a little more into that? Have there been any changes in terms of where that demand is coming from and I'm sort of asking about specifically in the context of what seems to be weaker Latin American growth?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Yeah, Brad, this is Gary. So in the first quarter, we did 249,000 barrels a day of diesel. If you include jet and kerosene with that, we're up to 295,000 barrels a day. That was split with about 80% going to Latin America, 20% to Europe. During the first quarter, the arb to Europe was closed most of the first half of the first quarter. It opened back up and has remained opened, so I think you'll see a little more volume going to Europe but we're still seeing very good Latin America demand for diesel as well moving forward.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Mike. Thinking about the cadence of CapEx, the first quarter number looked pretty light relative to where I expected it to be. And certainly on a run rate basis, it's not particularly close to the $2.6 billion annual guidance. Is there a reason to think that the CapEx is going to pick up throughout the year or are you guys running ahead?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right now, the $2.6 billion is what we have in our forecast. On an annualized basis, obviously we're way short of that, but we're okay on the forecast.","R. Lane Riggs - Executive Vice President, Refining Operations & Engineering","Hey, Brad. This is Lane. I'll give a little color on that. I mean the first quarter's always a little bit of a challenge. You're coming out of the holidays and you have weather to contend with. And so the first quarter for us, at least seasonally, is always light with respect to our CapEx. We'll spend some \u2013 we'll spend more than the run rate \u2013 than that rate second quarter and third quarter, and then it slows down again in the fourth quarter. And so that's where I would say the seasonality of the CapEx has been for our company.","Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks for that.","Operator","From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we have Doug Leggate. Please go ahead.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if I was going to get squeezed in there or not. How're you doing, Joe?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good, Doug. You?","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Not too bad. Thank you. I got a couple; one micro and one specific. I guess it's a follow-up to Brad's question. Last year when margins, gasoline in particular, was extraordinary strong at the beginning of the year, European refiners were running pretty hard. And I guess that, that dynamic is changing quite a bit. Given your European footprint or your Pembroke exposure, I'm just curious as to what you're seeing there. Is the distillate market starting to tighten up a little bit, at least in terms of what your prior comments were about the potential for export reopening?","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Yeah, so we've seen the arb to export diesel to Europe open since midway through the first quarter. It remains open today and we are seeing good demand for European quality distillate in our system.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I guess what I'm getting at, are you seeing refinery runs \u2013 is that translating to lower production in the region? At least that's what we're seeing. I just wanted to see if it was showing up on your markets as well locally.","Gary K. Simmons - Senior Vice President-Supply, International Operations and Systems Optimization","Yeah, so I think what you're \u2013 at least my view of where they are in Northwest Europe, the refineries that are cutting are primarily refineries that are producing fuel oil because fuel oil is so discounted today. Pembroke is a pretty high conversion refinery, so we're seeing production remain very high at Pembroke.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Two quick follow-ups, if I may. So the first one, I'm afraid, is M&A as well. Just very curious, Joe, you mentioned Europe. I mean European markets traditionally have not been anywhere near as seasonal or healthy, if you like, as the U.S. How would you characterize the opportunity set that you see there or was it just a passing comment?","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's more of a passing comment. I would say very limited. But I don't want to tell you we would never look at a UK refinery and then we show up in some point in time and do it, and you remind me of it. But I mean, Doug, you know those markets. I mean frankly, we've said this for years that \u2013 and we got a gem in Pembroke. And back to your first question, all the diesel that's produced at Pembroke moves inland, most of the gasoline. And so we've got a fairly unique footprint there in that we're able to supply the domestic markets in Ireland in a very efficient way.","So we really like that. We could find a similar type of asset in a market that was similar, okay, and when I say that, I really am thinking primarily of the UK. Well, I think we'd consider it. Now, are we having active conversations on anything like that? No. But would we want to move into France, Spain, Italy or the Med? The answer would be no. So it's more of a passing comment.","But we tell you guys we're looking at everything that's out there and we do that because we're always looking for opportunities to continue to grow the EPS. But again, we're very pleased with the portfolio that we have and we can create significant income with it. So we don't feel desperate to do anything in that M&A market. Certainly, again, it's in competition for all the other good uses of cash that we have.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Unrelated, I guess my follow-up is for Mike. Mike, the tax \u2013 or the cash received for the drop-down relative to the price agreed. How should we think about the after-tax proceeds versus your slightly lower drop-down target?","Michael S. Ciskowski - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would think, I mean we're going to continue to look at each of the drops, as we come up on them in this course, as far as how we want the financing we do to mitigate taxes. I think it would probably be on this next drop similar of a cash tax \u2013 after-tax cash as (50:58).","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You know, Doug, looking longer term and this is just the reality of it, a lot of the logistics assets that would be dropped are going to \u2013 they got zero tax basis, and so I think for a long time when everybody was looking at 10-time multiples, 11-time multiples on these drop transactions with all that cash flowing back in, we were really overstating the actual cash that would be coming back into the sponsor, and so the reality of it is we are not changing the portfolio of assets that we have to drop. We're really looking at the drop structure and doing it as efficiently as we can. Again, Mike mentioned earlier that we think the capital markets are certainly there, but it's a little bit expensive to go to the public markets today. We don't have a gun to our head to do something because we've got the distribution covered for two years with the cash flow stream that we have today.","And all the things that you mentioned earlier, I think we are in a very, very strong position here and we can take our time and time to market and be patient in doing this and whether we do $500 million or $750 million now and then we will start talking about next year what we are going to do, we are going to continue to grow the LP, we are going to continue to drop, I think we're just waiting to see if things don't improve a bit and certainly higher crude prices should take some of this pressure off if we see the crude markets move up and we should be in a good place going forward.","Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate all your comments, Joe, and your patience with all our M&A questions this morning. Thanks.","Joseph W. Gorder - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No problem.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Locke for closing remarks.","John Locke - Vice President\u2013Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you, Bianca. We appreciate you all for joining us today.
