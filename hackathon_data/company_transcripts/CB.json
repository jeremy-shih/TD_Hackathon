Today's call is being recorded.","Before we begin, Chubb has asked me to make the following statements. In order to help you understand Chubb, its industries, and its results, members of Chubb's management team will include in today's presentation forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. ","It is possible that actual results might differ from estimates and forecasts that Chubb's management team makes today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such differences appears in Chubb's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In the prepared remarks and responses to questions during today's presentation, Chubb's management may refer to financial measures that are not derived from generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in the press release and the financial supplement for the fourth quarter 2014, which are available on the Investors section of Chubb's website at www.chubb.com.","Please note that no portion of this conference call may be reproduced or rebroadcast in any form without Chubb's prior written consent. Replays of this webcast will be available through Friday, February 27, 2015. Those listening after January 29, 2015 should please note that information and forecasts provided in this recording will not necessarily be updated, and it is possible that the information will no longer be current.","Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Finnegan. ","John Finnegan","Thank you for joining us. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Chubb had record operating income per share of $2.29. Net income per share was $2.35. This capped off another great year, with operating income per share of $7.63 for the full year and net income per share of $8.62, each of these being the second best results in Chubb history. As you\u2019ll recall, 2013 earnings per share were the best in our history, so great back to back performance, reflecting superior underwriting execution. ","Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3, the best combined ratio for any quarter in the past six years and a 1.2 point improvement over the year earlier fourth quarter. The impact of catastrophe losses in the 2014 fourth quarter was 0.8 of a point compared to 2.1 points in the fourth quarter of 2013. On an ex-cat basis, our combined ratio was 83.5, essentially the same as in the fourth quarter of 2013. ","Premiums worldwide were up 3% in the fourth quarter or 4% excluding the impact of currency. As in recent quarters, we saw higher retention levels, continued rate increases, and new business. GAAP book value per share at year-end was $70.12, up 8% for the year. Our capital position remains very strong, and we just completed our existing share repurchase program. Today, we announced a new $1.3 billion buyback program.","As you saw in our press release, we have provided 2015 operating income per share guidance of $7.35 to $7.65, and Ricky will have more to say about guidance as well as our capital management activities.","And now Dino will provide detail on commercial and specialty lines, and then Paul will discuss personal lines and claims. Dino? ","Dino Robusto","Thanks, John. In a marketplace that was competitive but still behaving rationally regarding price and terms and conditions, commercial and specialty both had strong performance in the fourth quarter. This was characterized most importantly by excellent underwriting profitability and by executing our stated plans of emphasizing the retention of our profitable portfolio while pushing for rate increases on those accounts that still require it.","We also leveraged our distinct underwriting and claims advantages to write new business in our targeted niches. Beginning CCI, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 88.5 compared to 89 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 89.5 in the third quarter of 2014.","The fourth quarter impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 1.8 points of the combined ratio in 2014 and 0.6 points in 2013. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI\u2019s fourth quarter combined ratio improved to 86.7 in 2014 from 88.4 in the prior year.","Drilling down into the CCI lines, we had another strong performance in the Multiple Peril, where the combined ratio was 85.4 compared to the unusually low 73.5 in the fourth quarter of 2013. The casualty combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 99.8 compared to the 102.9 we posted in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Our worker\u2019s compensation combined ratio of 80.2 was outstanding, more than an 11 point improvement over the 91.5 that we posted in the fourth quarter of 2013 and well below our 10-year average of 88.","Property and marine produced a fourth quarter combined ratio of 84.4 compared to 83.1 in the year ago quarter. In recent conference calls, we told you that in light of rate increases over the past several years, we were increasingly focused on retention, while at the same time taking advantage of better priced new business in market segments we target.","This focus is contributing to our positive growth. In CCI, fourth quarter net written premiums grew to 5% or $1.3 billion. Worker\u2019s comp grew 16%, but as you would see if you looked back at results in previous quarters, this line can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter due to the presence or absence of a larger premium account.","For example, our workers comp growth rate for the third quarter of 2014 was down 1% while for the full year we grew the line by 6%, a little less than the 8% we grew it in 2013. Notwithstanding these fluctuations, we were able to achieve several points better retention in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, along with a slight increase in rate, and we were able to cross-sell a few large policies to existing customers.","Overall retention for CCI in the fourth quarter was 88% in the U.S., high by historical standards and a 1 point improvement over the third quarter. Please note that in our press release, the retention and renewal rate changes for CCI and CSI that are stated to be for our third quarter are in fact those for our fourth quarter. We apologize for any inconvenience. A corrected release is in the process of being issued.","Now, even with this higher retention, we achieved an overall written renewal rate increase of 2% for the U.S. booked. This was the sixteenth consecutive quarter we obtained rate increases and the earned premium impact continues to keep pace with our long term loss cost trends. Outside the U.S., CCI\u2019s average renewal rate increases in the fourth quarter were marginally positive. ","As we noted last quarter, the successful execution of our rate retention strategy resulted in there being fewer accounts in our portfolio that need substantial rate increases or that need to be culled from the book entirely. Of course, in those instances where we cannot secure appropriate rates and terms, the culling will persist.","With respect to new business, we continue to take advantage of our unique expertise and products and services to target the market segments in which we specialize. In the fourth quarter, we were able to secure new business opportunities that we believe will meet our required return targets in many of these segments.","In the U.S., our new to lost business ratio was 1.4:1 compared to 1.0:1 in the third quarter of 2014. This improvement reflects the historically high retention rate and some additional new business. Notwithstanding the continued improvement, new business writings as a percentage of our overall portfolio were still slightly below levels we were writing several years ago.","For the full year, CCI\u2019s net written premiums increased 2% to $5.4 billion. The combined ratio was 89.9 in 2014 versus 86.5 in 2013. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 3.8 points of the 2014 combined ratio compared to 2.1 points in 2013. Excluding the impact of cats, CCI\u2019s combined ratio for the year was 86.1 in 2014 and 84.4 in 2013. ","Turning now to Chubb\u2019s specialty insurance, our fourth quarter combined ratio was an outstanding 76.7 in 2014 and represented a 5 point improvement compared to 81.9 in the fourth quarter of 2013. And professional liability, which represents the majority of our portfolio, the combined ratio was 80.3 compared to 85.9 in the fourth quarter of 2013 due mainly to a higher level of favorable development.","Our continued strong underwriting results in the quarter stem from our disciplined underwriting, which is increasingly informed by our use of advanced analytics, continued culling actions, where we don\u2019t believe we can achieve our required return, and the cumulative effect of rate increases, which on our U.S. book exceeded 20% over the last three years.","With respect to growth, CCI\u2019s net written premiums in the fourth quarter were $701 million, down about 1%. For the professional liability portion of CSI, net written premiums of $628 million were essentially flat on a worldwide basis, but up 3% in the U.S. As we have noted in the past, premium growth in Chubb\u2019s specialty can vary from quarter to quarter, in part due to the absence or presence of large premium accounts and in the fourth quarter we did see fewer good new business opportunities outside the U.S. than we did in the third quarter.","In the fourth quarter, renewal retention for professional liability in the U.S. remained at the very high 89% level achieved in the third quarter. At the same time, we secured a 4% average renewal rate increase in our U.S. book, in line with our long term loss cost trends. The fourth quarter was the thirteenth consecutive quarter in which we achieved rate increases in the U.S. In markets outside the U.S., the average renewal rate change was close to flat. ","In the U.S., professional liability\u2019s new to lost business ratio in the fourth quarter was 1.3:1, unchanged from the third quarter. This was a function of high retention levels in both quarters and our ability to find quality new business opportunities in our target markets following several years of industry rate increases and underwriting actions.","Turning now to the surety portion of the specialty book, the combined ratio of 48.6 in the fourth quarter represented a 5 point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2013 and a 6 point improvement when compared to third quarter of 2014.","Net written premiums for surety were $73 million, down 6%, reflecting the lack of large premium transactions like those booked in the fourth quarter of 2013 for our customers who were performing work on major construction projects. It is not uncommon to experience this variation in work orders, but with the U.S. economy improving, we expect that our surety customers, who are among the best in their field, should particularly benefit from that growth.","For the full year 2014, CSI\u2019s net written premiums increased 2% to $2.7 billion and the combined ratio was an outstanding 80.5 compared to 84.3 in 2013. Professional liability premiums increased 3% to $2.4 billion and the combined ratio was 82.2 versus 89.3 in 2013.","Surety premiums for 2014 declined 4% to $300 million and the combined ratio was 67.3 versus 47.2 in 2013. Bottom line, we are very pleased with the strategies we implemented and the actions we have taken to improve the profitability of our specialty business, and we are well-positioned to continue to grow profitably over time.","And with that, I will turn it over to Paul. ","Paul Krump","Thanks, Dino. Chubb Personal Insurance performed very well in the fourth quarter of 2014. CPI net written premiums increased a healthy 4% to $1.1 billion. CPI delivered a terrific combined ratio of 83.9 in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the 83.5 produced in the corresponding quarter of 2013.","Catastrophes had only a 0.1 percentage point impact on CPI\u2019s fourth quarter combined ratio, compared to a 5.3 point impact in the fourth quarter of 2013. CPI\u2019s ex-cat combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2014 was 83.8 versus 78.2 in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Homeowners premiums increased 3% for the quarter. The homeowners combined ratio was 76.5 compared to 75.8 in the corresponding quarter of 2013. Catastrophes had a 0.1 percentage points impact on the homeowners combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to 8.5 percentage points in the corresponding quarter of 2013. ","Excluding catastrophes, the homeowners combined ratio in the fourth quarter was 76.4 versus 67.3 in the fourth quarter of 2013. As you might recall, we pointed out last year at this time that the 76.3 ex-cat combined ratio for homeowners was an unusually good result. The average homeowners renewal premium increase totaled 6% in the U.S. compared to 7% in the third quarter. ","In the fourth quarter, net written premiums for personal auto grew 4%. The personal auto combined ratio was 95.2 compared to 93.9 in the corresponding quarter of 2013. CPI policy retention in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 89% for both homeowners and personal auto. Homeowners policy retention was down slightly while personal auto was unchanged from the third quarter of 2014.","In other personal, which includes our accident, personal excess liability, and yacht lines, we had strong growth of 6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the combined ratio was 95.1 compared to 96.8 in the corresponding quarter of 2013.","Looking now at our full year revenue, CPI\u2019s net written premiums increased 4% to $4.5 billion. CPI produced a combined ratio of 90.9, including 5.5 percentage points of catastrophe losses compared to a combined ratio of 87 for 2013, including a 7.2 impact from catastrophes. Excluding catastrophes, CPI\u2019s combined ratio for the full year was 85.4 in 2014 versus 79.8 for 2013.","For all of 2014, homeowners premiums increased by 4% to $2.8 billion. The homeowners combined ratio was 88.3, including an 8.9 percentage point impact from catastrophes compared to a combined ratio of 82.3 in 2013 including an 11.5 impact from catastrophes.","Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the homeowners combined ratio for the full year was 79.4 in 2014 versus 70.8 in 2013. Personal auto premiums increased 1% in 2014 to $740 million and the combined ratio was 96.8 compared to 94.8 in 2013. Other personal lines\u2019 premiums increased 8% for the full year to $1 billion and the combined ratio was 94 versus 94.8 in 2013. ","Turning now to claims for Chubb overall, it was a fairly benign quarter from a loss perspective. On an ex-cat basis, new [unintelligible] claim counts increased only 3% from the fourth quarter of 2013, which is in line with our premium growth. ","Regarding catastrophes, their impact in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 0.8 percentage points of the combined ratio, or $25 million before tax. This includes $35 million of favorable development from cat events earlier in 2014, which was partially offset by $11 million of unfavorable development from cat events in 2013 and prior years.","Losses from catastrophe events that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 totaled $49 million and were dominated by two hail and wind storms, one in Brisbane, Australia and another that impacted Texas and Kansas.","The impact of catastrophes for the full year 2014 was 3.6 percentage points or $444 million before tax, reflecting $11 million of unfavorable development from events that occurred in 2013 and prior years.","And now, I will turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail. ","Richard Spiro","Thanks, Paul. Looking first at our operating results, we had strong underwriting income of $477 million in the quarter. For the full year, underwriting income was $1.4 billion. Our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was 84.3 compared to 85.5 in the same quarter a year earlier. ","Our expense ratio for the quarter was 30.5 in 2014 versus 30.8 in 2013. For the full year, our combined ratio was 88.3 in 2014 compared to 86.1 in 2013, and our expense ratio for the full year was 31.4 in 2014 and 31.9 in 2013. ","Please note that over the past few years, our expense ratio in the fourth quarter has been lower than for other quarters in the full year due to seasonality. The expense ratio varies from quarter to quarter due to mix of business and other variables.","Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 6% in the fourth quarter to $267 million, due once again to lower reinvestment rates in our fixed maturity portfolios and to a lesser extent the impact of foreign currency translations.","Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $18 million or $0.06 per share after tax, including a $0.01 per share loss from alternative investments. For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $67 million or $0.17 per share after tax, including a gain of $0.09 per share from alternative investments. ","Unrealized appreciation before tax at December 31, 2014 was $2.7 billion. For comparison, at year-end 2013, unrealized appreciation before tax was $1.9 billion. The increase in unrealized appreciation in 2014 largely reflects the decrease in interest rates and the increase in equity markets that occurred during the year.","The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is four years and the average credit rating is Aa3.","We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At December 31, our holding company portfolio had $1.8 billion of investments, including approximately $585 million of short-term investments.","Book value per share under GAAP at December 31, 2014 was $70.12 compared to $64.83 at year-end 2013, an increase of 8%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate as available for sale fixed maturities at amortized cost were $65.03 compared to $61.86 at 2013 year-end, an increase of 5%.","With regard to book value, as you may know, companies like Chubb that have defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans are required to prepare an annual revaluation of the plan\u2019s assets and benefit liabilities. As a result of our revaluation at the end of 2014, the estimate of our planned liabilities increased and our change in book value for the fourth quarter was adversely impacted by approximately $350 million after tax.","The increase in our plan\u2019s liabilities was primarily due to the decrease in our discount rate assumption that resulted from the decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year end rates, and to a lesser extent, a change in our mortality assumption. ","The change in our mortality assumption reflects the impact of the October 2014 revision of the Society of Actuaries\u2019 mortality tables, which many companies, including Chubb, take into account in the measurement of their benefit plan liabilities. In addition, the change in book value during the quarter was negatively affected by about $75 million due to the impact of foreign currency translation. ","As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2014 on prior year reserves by [SBU] as follows. In CPI, we had about $15 million, CCI had about $50 million, CSI had about $90 million, and the runoff reinsurance assumed business had none, bringing our total favorable development to about $155 million for the quarter. ","This represents the favorable impact on the fourth quarter combined ratio of 5 points overall, including an adverse impact from prior year catastrophes of $11 million. For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we had about $115 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $25 million in CPI, $35 million in CCI, $55 million in CSI, and none in reinsurance assumed.","The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2013 was about 4 points overall, including a favorable impact from prior year catastrophes of $6 million. Favorable development for the full year 2014 totaled about $635 million. It had a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 5 points, compared to $710 million in 2013 and a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 6 points.","For the fourth quarter of 2014, our ex-cat accident year combined ratio was 88.8 compared to 87 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and for the full year 2014, our ex-cat accident year combined ratio was 90, compared to 88.4 in 2013.","During the fourth quarter of 2014, our loss reserves decreased by $350 million, including a decrease of $344 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $6 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The overall decrease in reserves reflects the decrease of $53 million related to catastrophes. The impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter, resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $155 million.","Turning now to capital management, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $346 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $100.58 per share.","For the full year 2014, we repurchased 16.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.6 billion and an average cost of $92.05 per share. As of December 31, 2014, there was approximately $52 million remaining under our January 2014 repurchase program, which we completed this month.","As we announced today, our board of directors has authorized a new $1.3 billion share repurchase program. The size of the share buyback program is essentially in line with the 2015 operating income reflected in our guidance, less shareholder dividends. We intend to complete this program by the end of January 2016, subject to market conditions and other factors. ","Finally, let me make a few additional comments regarding our guidance. We expect operating income per share for 2015 to be in the range of $7.35 to $7.65, with a midpoint of $7.50. Before reviewing the key assumptions underlying our 2015 operating income per share guidance, I would like to highlight a couple of external factors that will impact our financial results this year.","First, interest rates have continued to decline on a global basis, which will once again put pressure on investment income. In addition, the impact of lower interest rates on our discount rate assumption will increase our pension and post-retirement benefit costs in 2015, which will be reflected in the slightly higher expense ratio for the full year, compared to the 31.4% expense ratio in 2014.","Second, since roughly a quarter of our business is generated outside the United States, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies will have a negative impact on both premium growth and investment income. ","As we said in our press release, we are assuming for the full year a negative 2 percentage point impact of foreign currency translation on written premium growth and a negative 1 percentage point impact on the growth of property and casualty investment income after tax. ","Our operating income per share guidance assumes, for the full year 2015, an increase of 1% to 3% in net written premiums or 3% to 5%, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, a combined ratio of 89 to 90, a decline of 6% to 8% in property and casualty investment income after taxes, or down 5% to 7%, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, and our guidance assumes 230 million average diluted shares outstanding.","Our guidance also assumes 4 percentage points of catastrophe losses, in line with our median annual catastrophe impact over the last 10 years. In terms of sensitivity, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on 2015 operating income per share is approximately $0.36. ","And now, I will turn it back to John. ","John Finnegan","Thanks, Ricky. Chubb had an excellent fourth quarter, posting record operating income per share of $2.29, which generated annualized GAAP ROE of 13.6% and annualized operating ROE of 14.8%.","These first quarter results top off a terrific year in which we achieved excellent operating and net income per share. Renewal rates improved in all three SBUs, with average U.S. rate increases for the full year of 3% for [unintelligible] commercial, 5% for professional liability, and we also achieved average U.S. renewal increases of 6% for personal lines.","The growing rate adequacy of our overall book has increased our focus on retaining more of our profitable portfolio, as evidenced by our high renewal retention rates. And in light of broader industry rate increases in the last few years, we were able to secure some additional new business that was attractively priced within the market segment we targeted.","We continued to actively manage our capital in 2014 by returning more than $2 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our ongoing commitment to capital management is demonstrated by the new $1.3 billion share repurchase program we announced today.","As you can tell from our 2015 guidance, we are expecting another overall strong year, despite the dual headwinds of continued low interest rates and the strong dollar.","And with that, I\u2019ll open the lines for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie. ","Amit Kumar","Two quick questions on the guidance. The first is on the NPW guidance for 1% to 3%. And even if I exclude the foreign exchange impact and factor in the comments on retention, why wouldn\u2019t the top line move directionally in the opposite direction more, versus what we have seen previously? Is it simply a function of new business, or are you factoring in some maybe rate momentum going forward?","Richard Spiro","I think it\u2019s a combination of things. I\u2019ll start by putting our 2014 premium growth in perspective. So for the full year 2014, net premiums written increased 3% or 4%, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. So we\u2019re expecting next year that ex-currency premium growth will be consistent with our 2014 growth, and we believe that it\u2019s reasonable, based on the current market environment.","In terms of assumptions, I can\u2019t go through each of the individual pieces, but obviously, retention is strong. You heard the commentary on rates and what we\u2019re seeing in the near term, and then there\u2019s some new business, of course, as well. ","And I\u2019d highlight also, just think about the relationship between premium growth and renewal rate increases. And not necessarily correlated. So for example, if you look back in 2013, we actually had lower ex-currency premium growth of 3%, but average renewal rates were actually higher than they were in 2014.","So hopefully that gives you some idea of what we\u2019re thinking.","Amit Kumar ","The only other question I had was on the discussion on the combined ratio guidance. The ex-cat guidance is 85 to 86. Can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about the underlying accident year going forward? Does that still improve based on how earned rates come in exceeding loss cost trends? Or does it sort of flat line? Can you just expand on that? ","John Finnegan ","A variety of things could happen, obviously. It depends to some degree on where rates do go. But you know, when you look at the 2015 accident year, let\u2019s start with what most of the analysts talk about as margin expansion, meaning earned rate versus long term loss cost trends. ","Remember that the 2015 accident year is based on earned rate, which means it\u2019s 50% driven by rate increases in the year 2014 and 50% by rate increases in the year 2015. In the year 2014, our rate increases exceeded loss cost trends and even our shorter term loss costs. So we go in with some tailwinds, a point or two from 2014, but 50% 2015 accident year. ","Now, as we move in toward 2015, right now our earned rate is still a little bit in excess of our loss cost trends in the fourth quarter, but our written rate is about neutral to loss cost trends. I don\u2019t know where rate\u2019s going but I expect, as we run a variety of scenarios, there\u2019s more bias in the scenarios to rate increases not being as high as they currently are.","But there could be some pressure on margins related to the 50% of accident year performance related to 2015. But then you\u2019ve got to combine that with the 2014 tailwind, and it\u2019s hard to call whether you\u2019re going to see, overall for the 2015 accident year, contraction or margin expansion. ","The second thing is that, we\u2019ve talked about this ad nauseam in the past, is that margin expansion analysis, even correct, doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate into year over year move in combined ratios. The other big factor is how do actual losses compare to loss cost trends? ","And as we saw this year, our actual losses, especially in the property lines, or I\u2019d say homeowners, were significantly higher than what we\u2019ve experienced in recent years. And you know, we\u2019d hoped to see some reversion to the mean in that line of business. ","There\u2019s no guarantee that you can\u2019t be higher than the mean two years in a row, so we\u2019re conservative when we look at that, but again, we\u2019re hoping for some reversion to the mean, actual losses. In some of the lines, we had an unfavorable experience in this year, which largely related to luck factors such as fire and non-cat water. ","Richard Spiro","And if I can add one thing, apart from the loss ratio side, as I mentioned in my remarks, on the expense ratio side, given the higher pension costs that we expect to incur in 2015, that the expense ratio also will be higher than what we experienced in 2014.","John Finnegan ","And finally, when you\u2019re looking at our guidance, you asked specifically about accident year, but when you look at our guidance for combined ratio, that\u2019s obviously a calendar year number. The big missing factor is development, and development is a major contributor to results. It was 5 points this year. Don\u2019t know if you can run that forever, so we have a variety of scenarios about development. But you\u2019d have to take that into account when you formulate your own projections. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. ","Jay Gelb","First, I had a question on the casualty combined ratio. In Q4 that was running a little high. I was hoping you could discuss that.","Dino Robusto ","The casualty ratio was the 99.8 in the fourth quarter, when you compare it to the third quarter of 2014, which is 95.3. It was 102.9 in the fourth quarter of 2013. The primary reason for the deterioration relative to the third quarter of 2014 is the impact of asbestos and environmental claims, which was heavier in the fourth quarter, although partially offset by more favorable development in excess liability. ","One other thing to point out, if you look at the full year 2014, our casualty combined ratio was 92.5, a 5 point improvement over 2013. So we remain pleased with the progress and the improvement in this line of business.","Jay Gelb ","So there was a Q4 impact of asbestos and environmental, and what was the dollar amount of that?","Dino Robusto ","About $60 million, or about 15 points to our casualty combined ratio in the fourth quarter compared to only $24 million, or 6 points, in the third quarter of 2014. ","Jay Gelb ","And then my second and unrelated question is on the high net worth personal lines business, of which Chubb has a major presence. ACE announced it\u2019s buying the Fireman\u2019s Fund high net worth business. I\u2019d be interested in your thoughts in terms of what that means for the competitive dynamic for a pretty important market for Chubb.","Paul Krump","Obviously, we don\u2019t know for certain how or if this will impact us, but over the decades, I think you well know there\u2019s been several firms which have entered the high net worth space to compete against us. Obviously, some of those players have exited over the years as well. ","We kind of look at it this way: we\u2019re the pioneers in this market. We developed it in the beginning. We have successfully competed in it now for nearly three decades, and we have every intention of doing so going forward. ","Jay Gelb ","So no real shift anticipated as a result of that acquisition?","Paul Krump ","We have our strategies, and we\u2019ll compete against the new entity, or the combined entity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith from Evercore ISI. ","Vinay Misquith","The first question is on loss trend. I believe you mentioned in your comments that written rate was in line with loss trend. So just curious as to what you\u2019re assuming for loss trend.","John Finnegan ","Let me talk about that for a second, and I\u2019ll reiterate something I said last quarter. When we talk about loss trend, we use 4%, but let me define that for you. Our loss trend is largely macroeconomic factors such as in workers comp it\u2019s healthcare inflation.","Loss cost trends are used by different firms in different ways. What it doesn\u2019t take into account is the impact of proactive underwriting initiatives. So the kind of culling of the book that we\u2019ve been talking about doing over the past two years reduces our loss cost in the short term. When you take into account the underwriting initiatives we have underway, we\u2019d expect our short term loss cost trends to be about a point or two lower than long term loss cost trends. ","So when we budget and look at profitability, we do this granularly, by line. But you know, we probably look at our short term loss cost trends at 2 to 3 points rather than the 4 point long term loss cost trend. But when I say we\u2019re about even in the fourth quarter, I was comparing written to long term. We\u2019re still a point or so above what we envision to be the short term loss cost trends. ","Vinay Misquith ","Right, but if I understand it correctly, that\u2019s purely because you\u2019ve taken some underwriting actions, correct?","John Finnegan ","Exactly, and I\u2019m sure all other firms do too. Yes.","Vinay Misquith ","The second question, I\u2019m looking at the accident year combined ex-cat for this quarter. That was about 88.5% for the company as a whole. Last year, it was about 87.2. So it went up year over year. Just curious as to why it rose year over year. ","John Finnegan ","What number are you using? Are you looking at the fourth quarter ex-cat accident year?","Vinay Misquith ","Yes, correct. ","John Finnegan ","88.8?","Vinay Misquith ","My math says about 88.5 this year versus about 87.2. So it went up by around 130 basis points year over year.","John Finnegan ","Year over year? Yeah, well, it was all due to CPI. Last year, we had an unusually good quarter. This year, we had a decent quarter. There was about an 8 point deterioration in homeowners, and that was basically all attributable to somewhat higher than normal non-cat and fire losses in the fourth quarter this year and extremely low fire losses in non-cat weather in the fourth quarter of last year. The rest of the units, CCI and CSI, were pretty much flat. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling","I wondered if I could follow on with a question on your personal lines business. I think I noticed you guys started advertising on television recently. And I was kind of surprised to see that. Just you\u2019re an agency company, you\u2019ve got a longstanding brand, and I\u2019m wondering how this kind of fits with your positioning of the personal lines business, how you are looking to be competitive as that business presumably gets more competitive. ","And can we read this into you guys thinking that somehow you\u2019ve been measuring the brand value, or consumer awareness, and we\u2019ve been seeing it slipping? Or is this sort of just something you guys felt like would be nice to do? ","Paul Krump ","I\u2019ll take a stab at it. First of all, thanks for noticing the ad. No regrets is the theme of the ad, and it pretty much tags onto what we\u2019ve had in the past, about expect the unexpected and insurance doesn\u2019t matter until it matters, and that kind of a thing. It\u2019s not just a personal lines ad. It is a Chubb Corporate ad, so we have people in there from a business, we have a couple of personal lines customers. ","It\u2019s really just trying to make certain that our name is out there in the marketplace. We do see, though, that there were some customers that, during the economic downturn, whether they be commercial or personal, that decided to save some money by going to less expensive insurance. And now that the economy\u2019s improving, we want to make certain that they know we\u2019re still out here and they don\u2019t have any regrets when they come to us.","So that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about. We\u2019re getting great feedback, though, from our agents, and a number of customers have called up and said that it\u2019s a nice use of a little bit of humor. So we\u2019re excited about it. ","John Finnegan ","You don\u2019t have worry about any line item on our financial statement from an increase in the advertising budget. [laughter]","Josh Stirling ","Good. Well, I always think of you guys as a humorous company. [laughter] So listen, I wonder if I could ask another question. We spend a lot of time talking about your guys\u2019 segments, but I was looking at your numbers, and it made me realize that the international business, it looks like it hasn\u2019t - I know FX makes this more complicated and harder to do with the way you present your numbers, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s had that much growth, but it also seems to have lower margins than your franchise in the U.S. ","And I\u2019m kind of wondering what you think your priorities are for those businesses and do you have opportunities to accelerate the growth rates or alternatively, to drive some greater profitability so they could look more like the United States?","John Finnegan ","We look at that. It\u2019s always discussed, currently, at the board level, overseas business and growth. It\u2019s very hard. You mentioned one thing. You know have exchange in here, so it\u2019s very hard. I think overseas used to be 25% or 26%. We think that maybe it\u2019s 23% or so today. But exchange is a big driver in that.","And then the other driver of relative growth is rates. And you know, rates in the U.S. over the last three years have been significantly higher than rates overseas. Growth has been hurt overseas by rates directly, and also because the lack of increase in rates has made new opportunities less attractive.","We still look at overseas as an area which should grow somewhat better than the U.S., constant change and similar rate increases. But you know, we\u2019ve also suffered over the last few years from an economic downturn in Europe, from Brazil turning down. So there are a lot of things that have happened in the last few years in the overseas economies in general, to exchange rates, and then the insurance industry just rate increases have not been as attractive as they\u2019ve been in the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi","Ricky, would it be possible to know what you were booking that comp business at, at an accident year basis? I know it was 80 combined on a calendar year basis, but I was just curious if we could understand kind of where you\u2019re booking that business.","Richard Spiro ","Yeah, that\u2019s not a number that we normally would give out. So, sorry about that.","John Finnegan ","Probably not one we have here right now, either. [laughter]","Michael Nannizzi ","Got it. Because obviously, you\u2019re growing a lot. It seems like there\u2019s maybe some bundling, some big accounts that you\u2019re bringing into the fold. I\u2019m just curious, is it possible directionally just to understand whether or not that\u2019s meeting your hurdle rates of return on an accident year basis? Can I ask you that one?","John Finnegan ","Absolutely, it is. And you know, again, the growth was great in the quarter. I think Dino pointed out in his remarks, we had seven or eight points for the year, eight last year. So you know, we were flat in the third and we were very good in the fourth. A lot of that\u2019s just timing. It\u2019s not a 16% growth business.","Michael Nannizzi ","And then I guess just looking at commercial overall, taking into consideration some of the non-cat weather, I felt like that was more in CPI during 2014, it looks like the underlying loss ratio didn\u2019t really change all that much, but you got rate throughout the year in CCI, and it seemed like comp was probably a bigger part of that growth and maybe got more rate than the rest of the book.","Just trying to square that. Was it the non-cat losses that maybe masked some of that margin expansion, or should we see some of that start to trickle through next year? ","John Finnegan ","We pointed out in the second quarter we had some very high large losses in the second quarter. They weren\u2019t non-cat weather, necessarily. But for the full year, our property marine kind of ran in line with our five year average, so I don\u2019t think that was an issue. I\u2019d say that first of all, when you look at CCI, we basically went from, what, five, four, three, and two were our rate increases over the course of the year? So we really didn\u2019t exceed long term loss cost trends by any significant amount, if at all, over the course of the year. ","Then second, you have these anomalies in actual versus loss trends. You know, for a point, we\u2019re talking about, 2013 was a very good year. So if you look at the analysis, 2013 through 2014, on an accident year basis, just on margin expansion, maybe it should have been a point better off. A point gets lost in [unintelligible], 2013 was a good starting base. So nothing really there to see.","Michael Nannizzi ","And just on the other personal lines of business, it\u2019s been running consistently in that sort of mid-90s range, and it\u2019s been growing more than the others. So how are you thinking about that? Is it low-hanging fruit, just from a bundling perspective? Does it provide retention benefits that more than offset the fact that the profitability is less than some of the other lines of business that you\u2019re maybe not growing as fast? Or is it the accident business that\u2019s not anywhere near the bundling of the other personal lines of business. Just trying to get some context there.","Paul Krump ","Just shy of about 70% of our other personal business is made up of accident, and accident has been what\u2019s helping fuel the growth in the other personal category there. It gets a little bit lumpy. You\u2019re right, when you look at it, basically running in the high single-digits for the year. ","The absence or presence of a large accident program is pretty much what will drive and make some of the swings there. But we hired some people a couple of years back, and we\u2019re doing very well in the accident space. ","Obviously, we\u2019re doing very well also in the personal excess liability space. We\u2019ve been writing a lot more umbrellas on individuals as well as on groups. The yacht business is slowly coming out of the doldrums from the economic downturn, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on in that category. ","John Finnegan ","I\u2019d say that accident, obviously being the lion\u2019s share of the category, it\u2019s a growth business, so right now the combines aren\u2019t exactly where we want it to be, which is quite often the case when you have a growth business. If your overall performance in that category is 95 and accident health is 70%, you could conclude that accident health is not running significantly below that. We hope, over the shorter term, that we actually see a substantial improvement in accident health.","But we\u2019re not unhappy. We\u2019re getting good growth and with growth comes a little bit higher expenses, and [you\u2019re not] earning through the income as fast, so over time, hopefully not too far, not too much time, I think it will improve. ","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan ","First question is that if you look back to 2013 and 2014, your operating results are pretty strong. You have record earnings. But [ROE] stayed roughly around between 11% to 13%. Going forward, the combined ratio could potentially deteriorate because the pricing is no longer rising as fast as in the past two years and the investment income continues under pressure. Or you can actually return this great return, 100%, of earnings to shareholders. Is there anything you can do to improve that ROE or that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at for the next few years?","Richard Spiro ","Obviously, we\u2019re doing a number of things. One, you\u2019ve heard on the business side, on this call and others, some of the underwriting actions we\u2019ve been taking to try to continue to improve the profitability of some of the books of business, where they\u2019re maybe not performing at the level we want. ","On the investment income side, I can tell you unequivocally, we are not going to change our investment strategy. We are not going to reach for yield in this environment. We simply do not see those opportunities. ","So the way we\u2019re going to try to continue to grow the earnings line as well as potentially ROE is continue to do what we\u2019ve been doing. We\u2019ll continue to be active in managing our capital. And there really aren\u2019t a whole lot of silver bullets out there. In the environment where we are today, where interest rates are, we think the ROEs that we are generating are actually quite attractive.","And our target ROE of 10% plus inflation over time has not changed. It\u2019s still what we\u2019re pushing in our pricing and in our rate discussions, and so the reality is, the only way you can get better than that, with investment income where it is, you\u2019ve got to get a better loss ratio. So we continue to push on that. ","John Finnegan ","We\u2019re talking 12.5% to 14.5% over the last two years, return on equity, in a 1% to 2% interest rate environment. That\u2019s a reasonably good return on equity when your investment income goes down 5% or 6% a year. And we\u2019re also carrying around, we think, some strong excess capital position. ","So I think those are pretty good returns. We gave you guidance for next year, so you know what we expect in our earnings, so you come up with some sort of assessment of where ROE will be. But in this environment, this interest rate environment, this investment income environment, you\u2019re not going to be running 16%, 17%, and 18% return on equity. ","Kai Pan ","That\u2019s great. My second question is a little bit different. Google recently announced that they\u2019re getting into the auto insurance business. I just wonder, do you see yourselves as a participant in any sort of an online marketplace for your personal products?","Paul Krump ","This approach is really focused on providing a price comparison driven distribution option for potential customers. I think it\u2019s really too early to know, based on our experience, if these types of distribution platforms actually work or not. I think I would direct you to look at what\u2019s happening in the U.K. in the last couple of years. There\u2019s been a couple of those platforms operating there, and what I can tell you is they\u2019ve had little to no impact on our automobile writings in the United Kingdom. ","Kai Pan ","Lastly, very quickly, do you have any early indication from the winter storm this week?","John Finnegan ","Juno? [laughter] As of now, we have an insignificant number of claims reported, and our initial investigations have not revealed any very large claims. But I want to just put out a little word of caution there. It isn\u2019t unusual with a Juno type snowstorm to have customers report claims to us over a period of weeks. You know, a water stain will appear in a closet they hadn\u2019t opened up for a few weeks, or they\u2019ll get to their secondary home and inspect it and see that there\u2019s been some damage there. So we\u2019re really encouraged by the paucity of claim activity that we\u2019ve had to date, but we\u2019re going to have to continue to monitor this. It\u2019s just too early to tell. ","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Ricky, I\u2019d like to know how you think about forecasting investment yield decline, or the extent to which the last three months of, you know, interest rates have come into that, what percent of the portfolio comes up for reinvestment during the year. It looks like your forecast accelerated in terms of decline from where it was a year ago. What are the ingredients that make that happen?","Richard Spiro ","You touched on a lot of them. So obviously, the way we do the forecasting is we take a look at the maturity profile of our portfolio, the upcoming year. We have to make, obviously, some assumptions related to what our cash flows are going to look like. We have our buyback and other things that impact all that. And we buy securities over time, which can impact some of the maturities and when they actually occur.","And we start by looking at that, and we have an estimate and a projection, if you will, of what we think our cash flows are going to look like, with the maturities. We have an estimate of what we think reinvestment rates are going to look like, and we project down over time. ","And obviously, as I mentioned, we also, this time around, given what\u2019s happened in the currency markets, also needed to take a look at what we\u2019re seeing, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. to make some guestimate about what we think the impact of currency will be. ","So that\u2019s how we do it. We look at our actual maturities and project out. It\u2019s sort of a moving target, because things change over time, but we have a pretty good idea of what we think the maturity schedule is going to look like. And as you know, we actually publish a maturity schedule in our 10-K every year, where we highlight the next few years of what the expected maturities are. So you can get a pretty good feel from that.","John Finnegan ","Interest rates have deteriorated in recent months, and the dollar has gotten stronger, so the outlook has deteriorated from real world factors. Whether that\u2019s permanent\u2026","Josh Shanker ","Is it reasonable to look at what\u2019s happened to the [10 year] in the last six months, and say the degree of the move is similar to the new money yield change at Chubb?","Richard Spiro ","You know, I don\u2019t have the comparison of what the new money yields were at year and last year. I can tell you what our current new money rates are and maybe you can get a sense from that, but basically, where we\u2019re reinvesting today, and obviously I\u2019ve said this before, it depends on asset class, but they run pretty close together these days. ","So outside the U.S., I\u2019d say our current reinvestment rates are about 2.25. Our reinvestment rate in tax exempt in the U.S. is probably around 2.4 or thereabouts. And our reinvestment rate for our taxable securities in the U.S. is probably around 2.5%.","And I\u2019ll go one step further. Given that, I can try to at least give you some idea of when we think about the maturity schedule and what\u2019s maturing over the next call it few years, on the U.S. tax exempt side, those reinvestment rates are probably 175 to 200 basis points below our maturing book yields on average over the next few years. For our domestic taxable fixed income maturities, it\u2019s probably 75 to 125 basis points. ","And there is some variability in this, because obviously, depending on when you bought a security, if you bought something five years ago, it may have had a higher coupon in the financial crisis period, and now it\u2019s going to be maturing. And then outside the U.S., it\u2019s about 25 to 75 basis points ","Operator","We\u2019ll next go to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen","I was hoping to get a bit more color on the continued favorable development in professional lines. I\u2019m wondering if you can maybe talk about what accident years it\u2019s coming from. Is it driven more by the frequency of claims or the severity of claims that you\u2019re seeing?","John Finnegan ","Let me say that your first question, professional liability reserves, the favorable development came from accident years 2010 and prior. 2011 and 2013 were roughly flat. 2012 slight adverse. Obviously, the later years, you don\u2019t have as much development. Overall reserve position really was all accident years were favorable, except pre-2004, they aggregated that period because of the A&E charge. But everything was favorable, so overall, all the years stood up pretty good.","Jay Cohen ","And what are the claims trends you\u2019re seeing in professional lines that\u2019s allowing the ongoing significant favorable development? ","John Finnegan ","I think when you talk about development, you\u2019re talking about kind of, largely, especially if you\u2019re going back three or four years, claims you know about. So you\u2019re talking about severity. You\u2019re not talking that much about frequency. In terms of frequency in current periods, they look fine, but when we talk about development, you\u2019re talking largely about the severity on claims you know about. Obviously, there can be some you don\u2019t, but for the most part, that\u2019s not the contributing factor. The loss experienced on claims that you have, you know about.","Paul Krump ","Maybe I can throw a little bit of color in here. You know, the claim trends, as John was saying, the patterns vary considerably, depending on the line of business, the types of claims. For example, EPL claims historically have tended to have a shorter lifespan than, say, public D&O claims. But with the economic downturn, we saw some lengthening in the duration of those EPL claims, while the notable segment of public D&O claims, those really involving the merger and acquisition activity, tend to resolve faster than the other types of D&O claims. ","John Finnegan ","So it is favorable loss experience, largely related to severity, on prior accident years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ","Meyer Shields","Looking at your guidance, it looks like, whether at the upper or the lower end of the range, your operating income expectations for this year are down about 3% than your original forecast for 2014, and the share repurchase program is down about 13%. I was hoping you could talk to the difference there. ","John Finnegan ","I think last year we decided to round up the number for a little bit bigger share repurchase program, and we identified that at the time. This year, we came in closer to the formula, which we were about $50 million above, I think, operating income less dividends, Ricky, aren\u2019t we?","Richard Spiro ","At the midpoint, depending on the assumptions.","John Finnegan ","So last year, we were a little bit higher than that formula would have given you. ","Meyer Shields ","So the valuation of the stock isn\u2019t something that is affecting this decision?","John Finnegan ","I\u2019d say this about valuation of stock. It\u2019s certainly not stopping us from doing buybacks, but in the past, we\u2019ve occasionally upped the amount on the buyback above this sort of framework, when we thought it was opportune based on valuation. That\u2019s been an occasional thing. At today\u2019s valuation, we don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any good reason to do that, but we still like the value, and we\u2019re willing to buy back $1.3 billion of shares. ","Richard Spiro ","And from an excess capital position, we continue to believe that we are in a very strong excess capital position based on both our internal assessment, as well as external. So the difference in the size of the buybacks year over year has nothing to do with that as well. ","Meyer Shields ","And this may be rounding also, but if 4% is sort of like the long term median [cat] provision, you\u2019ve got reinsurance that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, much, much cheaper now than it has been, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to buy reinsurance differently, to suppress the cat provision? ","John Finnegan ","To suppress cat exposure?","Meyer Shields ","Your net cat exposure, yeah.","John Finnegan ","You mean to buy more reinsurance?","Meyer Shields ","Yes.","John Finnegan ","Well, just because it\u2019s cheaper doesn\u2019t necessarily make it economic. It\u2019s cheaper than it was, but we think we\u2019ve balanced it pretty well. When we buy cat exposure, when we buy cat reinsurance, that has a few factors in it. One is sort of our balance sheet position and what we\u2019re willing to subject it to. The second is economics. It\u2019s still not cheap. And no, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll go out and see us adding all sorts of layers of cat reinsurance.","Richard Spiro ","We are obviously looking at the opportunities in the market, and on an opportunistic basis, we think that we can take advantage of the opportunities in the market, either to promote our growth or manage our volatility. We will certainly think about that, but as I said I think on the last quarter call, we\u2019re not going to change our longstanding strategy of focusing on underwriting and pricing of [each risk], just because reinsurance may be a little bit cheaper.","John Finnegan ","We found some opportunities in deals in the commercial markets. I\u2019ll let Dino talk about that a second.","Dino Robusto ","Yeah, clearly, with the broadening appetite and capacity, and some of the lower pricing that you\u2019re referring to, you\u2019re going to get individual situations where we\u2019re able now to get accounts that require larger limits of insurance than we would be comfortable with. So today\u2019s facultative reinsurance dynamics helps support those larger limits while we still effectively manage our overall net exposure.","Now, occasionally, we\u2019ve also used [fac] reinsurance, where maybe one of our insurers has moved to an area and expanded in an area where there\u2019s too much catastrophe exposure there for us and we can use some of the facultative reinsurance to cover us there. In this way, we get to be able to keep that account.","So, on individual account levels, we\u2019re clearly taking advantage of the facultative reinsurance marketplace, but as Ricky and John point out, we don\u2019t see it as influencing any wholesale change in our underwriting strategy. ","Operator","And our last question today comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny.","Ian Gutterman","First, Ricky, on the pension, can you just give us a sense of how much, in dollars, the cost has gone up?","Richard Spiro ","I\u2019ll give you a range, because it could be a moving target. It\u2019s sort of in the $30 million to $40 million range, a few tenths of a point or so on the expense ratio.","Ian Gutterman ","And then on FX, overall, international is about a quarter of your premiums it looks like. Is it similar by segment? Or are some segments much higher or lower than that, out of the three main segments?","John Finnegan ","It is about the same in total for each of the segments. CCI, right around the 25\/75 split, 25 overseas. Same within the professional line. Personal is a little bit heavier in the U.S. That said, when you look at the other personal, and we talked about the accident piece here, that business is dominated outside the United States. It\u2019s about 70% outside the United States and 30% in the U.S.","Richard Spiro ","The 75\/25 split is on a premium basis. If you actually look at, say, for example, investment income, it\u2019s actually a smaller percentage of our after tax investment income, because obviously, in the U.S., we have the tax exempt securities, which have a higher coupon as well as a tax benefit. So while it\u2019s 25% of premiums outside the U.S., it\u2019s closer to 15% of our investment income.","Ian Gutterman ","And then the A&E, I thought I heard earlier that it was a $60 million impact. I\u2019m looking at the PDF that you put on the website, and it shows incurred loss for 2014 of $25 million versus $51 million in 2013. So can you explain the difference there?","John Finnegan ","That\u2019s just asbestos.","Ian Gutterman ","And on the surety business, do you do much business in the energy sector? And if so, can you sort of describe what kind of exposures, and what your outlook is for them? ","Dino Robusto ","You know, we do do business in the energy sector, and we have very long term, long tenured customers. Manage their business very effectively. Our underwriting\u2019s very carefully done with them. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable with our exposure, and we think with the improving economy that we\u2019re seeing, that should help us out going forward. ","Ian Gutterman ","Is it sort of general well construction, or is it like offshore drillers? Just trying to get a sense of what types of activities, I guess.","Dino Robusto ","It\u2019s just a little bit all over. Mining, construction, etc. It\u2019s a wide cross section.","Operator","And that does conclude our question and answer session for today. I will now turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. ","John Finnegan","Thank you for joining us and have a good evening.

Today's call is being recorded.","Before we begin, Chubb has asked me to make the following statements. In order to help you understand Chubb, its industry and its results, members of Chubb's management team will include in today's presentation forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Finnegan","Thank you for joining us. We're extremely pleased with the results for the third quarter and first 9 months. For the third quarter, operating income per share was $2.06. The second best quarterly operating EPS in the history of Chubb. For the first 9 months, operating income per share was $5.97 and net income was $6.80, both all-time records for Chubb. Our combined ratio for the third quarter was an excellent 85.7, reflecting the impact of higher rates and strong underwriting performance in all of our business units.","During the quarter, the market tone in the U.S. remained firm in both our Standard, Commercial and Professional liability lines, where we achieved high single-digit average renewal rate increases and improved retention levels. In personal lines, we continue to secure renewal change increases averaging in the mid-single digits.","Third quarter operating income per share increased 4% over last year and resulted in an annualized operating ROE of 14.8%. Net income per share for the third quarter was $2.10 and annualized ROE for the quarter was 13.9%. GAAP book value per share at September 30, 2013, was $62.04, that's a 3% increase since year-end 2012 and a 2% increase since September 30 a year ago. Our capital position is excellent and we continue to make good progress on our share repurchase program. Net written premiums for the third quarter were up 4%, reflecting growth in all 3 business units.","In light of our performance in the first 9 months for the year and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we've increased our guidance for the full year 2013 operating income per share to a range of $7.90 to $8, from its $7.30 to $7.50 range we provided on our July 2013 guidance. Ricky will discuss the increased guidance in greater detail.","And now, for more details on our operating performance, we'll start with Paul.","Paul J. Krump","Thanks, John. Chubb Commercial Insurance and Chubb Specialty Insurance both had outstanding performance in the third quarter.","At CCI, net written premiums were up 4% to $1.3 billion. The combined ratio was 85.2 compared to 87.2 in the third quarter of 2012. The impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 1.4 points of the combined ratio in the third quarter this year, compared to 0.2 points in the corresponding year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI\u2019s third quarter combined ratio improved 3.2 points to 83.8 from 87 in the third quarter of 2012. CCI secured renewal rate increases on 90% of our U.S. book during the third quarter and it was the 10th consecutive quarter of rate increases. CCI\u2019s average U.S. renewal rates in the third quarter increased 7%, compared to the 8% increase we secured in the second quarter of this year, while retention was up 2 points from 83% to 85% over the same 2 quarters.","While this retention and rate movement quarter-to-quarter is relatively minor, it reflects directionally the progress we have made with differentiated rate-taking and calling over the past few years. As indicated on previous calls, this has been done using a performance ranking system that segments customers based on our assessment of rate adequacy. The bottom line is that we now have less premium volume in our lowest performing groups, where rate increases were the highest, and we have more premium volume in our better performing groups, where the rate increases were lower.","For example, for the customer segments within CCI in the U.S. with the greatest rate need, the premium volume was 28% lower in the third quarter of 2013 versus the third quarter of 2012. With this bottom group now comprising less than 20% of the portfolio. This dynamic occurred because some of the segments graduated to our better performing groups due to earlier rounds of rate action while others saw their premium volume decline as a result of our aggressive calling actions. The obvious result is an improved book from a loss experience standpoint, but one where somewhat lower average rate increases would be expected.","CCI achieved U.S. renewal rate increases in each line of business in the third quarter of 2013. The rate increases were led by general liability, which averaged low double-digit increases followed by workers' compensation, Monoline property, package, auto, Excess\/Umbrella, marine and boiler. In CCI markets outside of the U.S., the average renewal rate increases were in the low-single digits in Canada, Europe and Latin America. Average renewal rates in Asia Pacific were flat. These rate increases are very consistent with what we've obtained in recent quarters. As noted earlier, CCI\u2019s third quarter U.S. renewal retention was 85%, a 2-point improvement over the second quarter. Continued strong renewal rate increases and retention contributed to CCI\u2019s premium growth. CCI\u2019s new-to-lost-business ratio in the U.S. was 0.9:1, up from 0.7:1 in the second quarter. This ratio was aided by the improved renewal retention. Renewal exposure change for the third quarter was slightly negative.","Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance. We were very pleased with CSI's results in the third quarter. Net written premiums increased 5% to $670 million and our combined ratio was 82.3, an improvement of 9.6 points compared to 91.9 in the year earlier third quarter. In the professional liability portion of CSI, net written premiums for the quarter were $594 million, up 5% from the third quarter of last year, our largest percentage increase in 8 years. Our combined ratio was 87.6, a 9.4-point improvement over the third quarter of 2012 and our best combined ratio in professional liability in more than 2 years. Average renewal rates for professional liability in the U.S. in the third quarter increased by 8%, making it the eighth consecutive quarter of rate increases. This 8% average renewal rate increase compares to 9% obtained in the second quarter this year and 8% achieved in the third quarter of 2012.","During the past quarter, 85% of our professional liability policies in the U.S. renewed with rate increases. We secured renewal rate increases in every professional liability line of business. Byline rate changes were led by EPL, private company D&O and not-for-profit D&O. These 3 business lines average renewal rate increases in the low double digits and were followed by crime, E&O, public company D&O and fiduciary.","In markets outside of the U.S., average renewal rates for professional liability in the third quarter increased by low single digits, with small variations by territory. Like CCI, these rate increases outside the United States are very consistent with what we've achieved in recent quarters. Renewal premium retention for professional liability in the third quarter was 86% in the United States, a 2-point improvement over the second quarter and a 5-point improvement over the first quarter this year. The new-to-lost-business ratio in the U.S. was 0.8:1, up from 0.7:1 in the second quarter. With respect to the overall pricing environment for professional liability in the U.S., the dynamic parallels what we've experienced in CCI, as rate increases in the impact of calling poor performers take hold, the quality of our book improves and we want to retain more accounts. Likewise, we have fewer customers that require material rate improvement.","Similar to CCI, professional liability uses a ranking or tiering system to inform individual account pricing decisions. The average rate increase by performance tier in the third quarter was similar to what we have been obtaining in the recent quarters. However, because our aggressive underwriting actions have produced a shift in premium volumes to the better performing tiers, the resulting overall average rate increase is 1 point lower. To further enhance the quality of the portfolio, we are writing a disproportionately large share of new customers in the lines and market segments with the most attractive pricing and projected margins, and the same can be said for CCI\u2019s new business writing.","We believe that all these ongoing aggressive underwriting actions are producing a stronger overall book with better profit potential. Regarding the surety portions of CSI, net written premiums in the third quarter were up 4% to $76 million and the combined ratio was an outstanding 41.3%.","With that, I will turn it over to Dino, who will review our personal lines results as well as corporate-wide claims. Dino?","Dino E. Robusto","Thanks, Paul. Chubb Personal Insurance had another great quarter. Net written premiums were $1.1 billion, an increase of 4%. The same growth rate as in the second quarter. CPI produced a combined ratio of 88.3 including 7-points of catastrophe losses compared to 82.8 in the corresponding quarter last year, which included an unusually low catastrophe toll of 1.5 points.","On an x cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 81.3 in the third quarter of this year, the same as in the third quarter of 2012 reflecting continued strong underwriting performance across all product lines. Homeowner premiums grew 4% for the quarter and the combined ratio was 84.3 compared to 76 points during the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 11.1 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the third quarter of 2013 compared to only 2.4 points in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding cats, the third quarter homeowners combined ratio improved to 73.2 in 2013 from 73.8 in the same period a year ago.","Personal auto premiums increased 9% reflecting strong growth both in the U.S. and outside the US. The combined ratio of 95.8 for personal auto was similar to the 95.3 we had in the second quarter but higher than the particularly strong 92 in the third quarter a year ago.","In other personal lines, premiums were flat, reflecting growth in personal excess offset primarily by the loss of a large accident program in Latin America. The combined ratio for other personal improved to 94.9 from 95.5 in the third quarter a year ago.","In the third quarter of 2015, we experienced continued growth in U.S. policy count for both homeowners and personal auto, which were up 1% and 3% respectively. Policy retention for homeowners in the U.S. was 90%, which is down less than 1 point from the same period a year ago, and has a strong result given the multiple price increases we have implemented over the past 3 years. U.S. policy retention for personal auto was 89% and has remained consistent over the last 6 quarters.","Turning now to claims, corporate-wide. In the third quarter of 2013, the impact of catastrophe losses was $92 million before tax, accounting for 3 points of the combined ratio and evenly split between cat losses in the U.S. and outside U.S. In the third quarter a year ago, we had cat losses of $17 million before tax, accounting for 0.6 percentage points of the combined ratio.","For the first 9 months of 2013, catastrophe losses were $347 million before tax or 3.9 points of the combined ratio. This compares with $264 million or 3 points in the first 9 months of 2012.","Now, I'll turn it over to Ricky who will review our financial results in more detail.","Richard G. Spiro","Thanks, Dino. Looking first at our operating results, we had strong underwriting income of $443 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 6% to $280 million due to lower reinvestment rates in both our domestic and international fixed maturity portfolios.","Net income were slightly higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $18 million or $0.04 per share after-tax. Net realized investment gains included $0.06 per share of net realized gains from our alternative investments. For comparison, in the third quarter of 2012, net income was the same as operating income, as net realized gains from its sale of securities were offset by $0.12 per share of net realized losses from our alternative investments. Unrealized depreciation before tax at September 30, 2013, was $2 billion, which was unchanged from the amount at the end of the second quarter.","The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43 billion as of September 30, 2013. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter and the average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.9 years and the average credit-rating is Aa3. We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At September 30, 2013, our holding company portfolio had $1.9 billion of investments, including approximately $660 million of short-term investments.","Book value per share under GAAP at September 30, was $62.04 compared to $60.45 at year-end 2012, and $60.99 a year ago.","Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost was $58.52 compared to $53.80 at 2012 year end and $53.96 a year ago.","As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the third quarter of 2013, on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CPI, we had about $20 million; CCI had about $100 million; CSI had about $70 million; and reinsurance assumed had an insignificant amount, bringing our total favorable development to about $190 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the third quarter combined ratio of about 6 points overall including slightly less than half a point from catastrophes. For comparison, in the third quarter of 2012, we had about $145 million of favorable development for the company overall including $25 million in CPI, $70 million in CCI, $35 million in CSI and $15 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the third quarter of 2012 was about 5 points overall with no impact from catastrophes.","For the third quarter of 2013, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 88.6 compared to 90.6 in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 2 points. During the third quarter, our loss reserves decreased by $79 million including a decrease of $68 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $11 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in run-off. The overall decrease in reserves reflects a decrease of about $60 million related to catastrophes and the impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $75 million.","Turning to capital management. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares at an aggregate cost of $326 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $86.17 per share. The end of the third quarter, we had 433 million available for share repurchases under our current authorization, and as we have said previously we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2014.","Let me conclude with the few comments on the revised guidance we announced in today's press release. As John mentioned, based on our 9-month results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are revising our 2013 full year operating income per share guidance to a range of $7.90 to $8 from the previous guidance range of $7.30 to $7.50. This revised guidance is based on operating income per share of $5.97 in the first 9 months and an estimated range of $1.93 to $2.03 for the fourth quarter. The revised guidance assumes 2 percentage points of cats for the fourth quarter, which would result in 3.4 points of cats for the calendar year. This compares to the full year cat assumption of 4.6 points included in our previous guidance. The decrease being due to the lower-than-expected cats in the third quarter. The impact on 2013 operating income per share of each point of cats for the full year is approximately $0.30. The impact on fourth quarter operating income per share of each point of fourth quarter cats is approximately $0.08. The revised guidance is also based on an assumption of 259 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year unchanged from our previous guidance.","And now, I'll turn it back to John.","John D. Finnegan","Thanks, Ricky. Let me summarize a few of the key highlights of the third quarter.","We have operating income of $529 million at $2.06 per share. Our annualized ROE was 13.9% and annualized operating ROE was 14.8%. We produced an x cat combined ratio of 82.7, a 3-point improvement over the year earlier third quarter.","Our x cat exiting year combined ratio was 88.6, a 2 point improvement over the third quarter last year. We continue to secure rate increases in all 3 business units. GAAP book value per share at September 30, 2013, was $62.04, up 2% from a year earlier and up 3% from year-end 2012. And we returned a total of 440 million to shareholders for share repurchases and dividends.","For the first 9 months of 2013, operating income totaled $1.6 billion. On a per-share basis, operating income for the first 9 months was $5.97 per share an 18% increase over last year and the highest 9-month operating income per share in Chubb's history. Annualized operating ROE for the first 9 months is 14.7% and annualized ROE was 15%. The combined ratio for the first 9 months was 86.4 and the x cat combined ratio was 82.5.","And during the first 9 months, we returned a total of $1.3 billion to shareholders including $975 million in share repurchases plus $342 million in dividends. Our strong performance in the first 9 months of the year has enabled us to increase our 2013 operating income per share guidance to a range of $7.90 to $8. The midpoint of our revised guidance is $0.55 per share higher than the midpoint of our prior guidance of $7.30 to $7.50.","In summary, we had a great third quarter and we continue to be encouraged by firm rate trends in the market.","Before opening up to your questions, I want to take a moment to discuss the management-related decisions that we announced today. First, our Board has decided to waive Chubb's mandatory retirement policy that would have required that I retire at the end of 2014 and has asked me to remain as Chairman, President and CEO until December 31, 2016. I've agreed to do so. I appreciate the Board's high level of satisfaction with Chubb's performance during my tenure, and I remain committed to working with the board and our strong management team to continue to produce superior results going forward.","Second, with respect to my management team, to broaden the experience of the top 3 members namely: Paul Krump, Dino Robusto and Ricky Spiro, and to further enhance their ability to contribute to the leadership of the company in the future, we are making the following changes effective January 1, 2014.","Paul, who is currently President of Commercial and Specialty lines, will become President of Personal Lines and Claims and will retain responsibility for our Accident and Health business. Dino, who's currently President of Personal Lines and Claims, will become President of Commercial and Specialty Lines and will retain responsibility for information technology. Ricky will remain Chief Financial Officer and will assume responsibility for corporate development.","Paul, Dino and Ricky have all contributed greatly to Chubb's success and I'm sure they will contribute even more in these new roles. They are a key part of the strong management team at Chubb, which is one of the reasons I agreed to stay on the Chubb for the coming years.","And now, I will be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First, we'll go to Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","John, congrats on the announcement that you'll be staying until 2016. I think the real reason is that you enjoy these conference calls too much with us. So that's what I believe. But very quickly moving on, the first question is on pricing in CCI, if I understand this correctly, when you talk about the different buckets, all as being equal, as the quality of the book has improved, it is likely that the headline pricing number will directionally move downwards going forward. Is that fair?","John D. Finnegan","I think that's fair, within reason. I mean, the order of magnitude is not going to take it from -- for a book, if you're going to take it from 8 to 0 or anything like that. But certainly, the more you get a little bit higher retention because you have a higher-quality book, you have less rate needs. And you're not getting the big increases in the lower-quality book, where you are losing a lot of business and that -- therefore, you see that we have lower volume in that book. It's not a bad thing. A higher-quality book is, obviously, a good thing. You can expect some creep downwards, though.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Do you have some sense of an early view as to what you might have seen in October?","John D. Finnegan","I'll let Paul answer that.","Paul J. Krump","Sure. Amit. I would say that in October, the data is not yet conclusive, obviously, because we're only -- we haven't ended the month yet. But we do get the preliminary data and we, obviously, get a lot of anecdotal input from our field staff. At this point, I would say that most of the lines are quite firm. We have sensed that the Monoline property is coming under a little bit more of competition in the month of October. That said, I don't want to give you any impression that it is falling off the cliff. It's clearly still running comfortably above loss-cost trend, but we did sense a little bit more competition on the Monoline property book.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Got it. The only other question I will stop is, in terms of loss-cost trends, specifically, could you just broadly address, has there been any change in the loss-cost trends in either professional liability or in workers comp over the past few months?","John D. Finnegan","Are you talking longer-term loss-cost trends? Or you're talking...","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Yes.","Paul J. Krump","The answer -- the short answer, Amit, is no. There has been no change there. We've -- you can think broadly across all the professional liability lines around 4%, 4.5% for their loss cost. Workers' Compensation, obviously, varies a bit by state but we haven't changed any of our loss cost trends over the last couple of months. And clearly, we take a longer-term view whenever we think about loss cost trends.","John D. Finnegan","I would say that while trends with severity and frequency we can make many which are macroeconomic or change that quickly, I mean, we have obviously been actual losses below trends and actual losses below expectation. And some of it has to do with luck -- we've talked in the past about large fire losses and non-cat-related weather. Some of it has to do with all of the underwriting and the calling we've done, where we have much more -- much better new business book and a much better book overall. So trends are one part of costs, as you look forward, but you also have to take into account underwriting strategies and initiatives too.","Operator","We now go to Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question is regards to Chubb's international operations, which I could say aren't about as much. Any areas with particular focus for rates, maybe an adequate or scale hasn't been achieved, and maybe can also touch on quickly, the competitive environment within Accident and Health?","Paul J. Krump","Sure, I'm going to take a stab at that. Taking the latter part, Accident and Health are -- globally, our 2 main competitors are AIG and Ace. We've been growing our book of business overseas very nicely. This past quarter, we did lose 1 large account due to an acquisition done in Latin America that Dino mentioned but aside from that, it's been growing quite nicely and that market is growing nicely. As respects, the rates overseas, they've been very consistent for the last couple of quarters in the Commercial space. I think the U.K. is probably -- and Canada are the more firm marketplaces. Australia came down a little bit in this past quarter, but you have to recognize, after the number catastrophes they had the past couple of years, we've got a lot of cumulative rate increase there. Our book in Asia and Latin America, frankly, is so different because it is so specialized. I don't think we're a great bellwether to look at those markets in their entirety, but the type of rate increase that we've been getting, the low single-digit numbers are very consistent with what's been running in the last couple of quarters.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Lastly, this $433 million left under the current repurchase authorization. Should we expect a new announcement in January within an 8-K?","John D. Finnegan","As always, we expect that our board will review our future buyback plans in January. So beyond that, I really can't comment.","Operator","Next we'll go to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","John, shareholders have been well served with you serving as CEO for over the past decade, and my question with today's announcement is, why did you agree to extend your tenure?","John D. Finnegan","Well, I think, I like the job and I think I've been able to contribute in the job. And there was every reason to continue to work at it. So, I'm more than happy.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right, I mean, I guess what I'm getting at is, it's been pretty clear who the potential internal frontrunners are for the CEO succession position and I'm just trying to -- given that there's 3 individuals that have been in place for quite some time, I'm just trying to understand why extend it out another 2 years as opposed to -- as opposed to making that change at the end of 2014?","John D. Finnegan","I don't think the executive committee members have been in their job an untoward long period of time. As you remember, John Degnan was Chief Operating Officer only 3 years ago. But I don't think you'd be asking the question if we happen to be -- we didn't happen to be one of the very rare companies that have a mandatory retirement age. I think the Board took a clean sheet approach and they decided that we -- that they have the discretion to waive it or not, what was in the best interest of shareholders. And they believed that the continuity of the current leadership team, with me as CEO, was in the best interest of shareholders. It's not a referendum on the capabilities of the executive committee members.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Of course not, okay. Has there been any changes in Chubb's reinsurance buying strategy?","Richard G. Spiro","No, again, it's Ricky. We don't buy all that much reinsurance. We tend to be more of a gross line underwriter. Our cat program and most of our other major property programs don't come up for renewal until April 1, and so no changes to speak of.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then last issue, with Chubb on track this year in terms of share buybacks plus dividends to turn around $1.3 billion in capital and the company also on track to generate probably at least $1.7 billion in retained earnings. I'm just wondering why the share buyback pace isn't a little more significant compared to, say, $2 billion that Chubb is doing back in 2010?","Richard G. Spiro","Again, we -- when we announced our program back in January, we did say that as a guide, the size of the program is roughly equal to, at the time, when we thought our projected 2013 operating income less shareholder dividends was going to be. However, the size of the program is not intended to simply adjust automatically based on our quarterly results or if our earnings expectations change. In fact, our expectation for earnings is only one of the factors that we take into consideration when we set the size of the share buyback at the beginning of the year. Other things we think about include our capital position, our valuation, prevailing insurance market environment and portfolio investment opportunity cost. And so, for example, as you know, the recent rise in interest rates, although they come off a little bit recently, has negatively impacted our excess capital position by reducing the size of the unrealized depreciation of our bond portfolio, although this is partially offset by the positive impact of higher rates on our reserve discount. So putting all those pieces together as a result, we believe that our current program is a sizable program, which appropriately balances all these considerations, including the economic opportunities we see in the market with the retention of a strong capital position and, as I mentioned earlier, we would expect that our board will review our future buyback plans again in January.","Operator","Next we'll go to Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","First questions on the competitive environment, just curious as to what that is on the commercial line side. And curious about whether you think you have achieved adequate rate based upon your entire book, and so will you be pushing for rate in excess of loss-cost trends next year?","Paul J. Krump","As I mentioned, Vinay, this is Paul. Why don't I talk a little bit about rate adequacy and touch on the competitive environment a little bit, but as I mentioned earlier, we've been working very hard to improve the overall quality of our book of business and moving closer to be in rate adequate. This has entailed all that differentiated renewal rate increases, disproportionately non-renewing the worst performers, trying to retain more the better performers and finally writing the bulk of new business in the segments in areas where we believe the rates are at or close to being adequate. However, given the current catastrophe loads, we're not just talking about the third quarter. You got to really look at the last 5, 6 years on what's going on out there with respect to the weather. I would suggest that, given those cat loads as well as today's low reinvestment yield, it really shouldn't be surprising to anyone that the overall book is still not currently at the adequate rate levels to achieve our long-run ROE targets, again, using new money yields. And even when we achieved our long-run target, Vinay, we've touched on this before, we've got that loss-cost trend out there, so we're going to be pushing very hard. So we feel good about all the improvements in the overall book of business. We think the market environment has certainly helped us a lot in the last couple of years. We think the market environment continues to be quite good. It's certainly very good in the professional liability lines, but we're going to keep driving for rate increases and across the board. But we're going to differentiate them and do them on a granular account-by-account basis.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure. Fair enough. That's helpful. The second question is on the personal auto side. You guys had a very strong growth this quarter on the personal auto side. Could you help me understand what's happening there, please?","Dino E. Robusto","It's Dino. We're obviously quite pleased with our progress in growing auto and more specifically, really cross-selling to our homeowners customer in the U.S, which has been a strategy of ours. So that now we're getting both growth internationally, which we haven't been getting for several years and also domestically. It's really -- it's a function of the continued investment we make in our sophisticated segmented auto pricing tool that I'd referenced before called Panorama. It's really allowing us to bring a high-quality product and service offering at a competitive and enough price level that's attractive to our targeted niche, which is the high net worth, a very specific niche. And given that today, we only have roughly 1\/3 of our Chubb homeowner customers have auto coverage with us, we have a lot more opportunity. And so we're going to continue to push that strategy going forward and continue to invest in our sophisticated analytics.","Operator","We'll go to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just kind of running some quick numbers, and please let me know if these are wrong, but it looks like if you don't include development, the ROE is probably somewhere in the 11-ish percent range. And then, if we adjust for new money yields, we're probably closer to the high single digits, maybe very low double digits. I'm just wondering like in terms of now being an opportunity to grow, is it that you see the ability to -- as maybe Paul was mentioning before, to adjust the profitability of the book from here, so that on the forward that ROE starts to gradually improve? Or how should we think about lining those up? And again, let me know if my math is wrong because it certainly could be.","Richard G. Spiro","It's Ricky. Let me put the math in perspective. If you take the x cat accident year ROE that we had in the quarter of 88.6, add on top of that a normalized cat load, whatever that is, and you know what we've generally assumed per cats as we put out our guidance at the beginning of the year as an example. You do get to an accident year ROE on the business we're writing today that is high single digit, low double digit. And to put that in perspective, we have an ROE target of 10% plus the cost of inflation over time. So generally, we think of that ROE target as been higher than that number and that's the reason, as Paul mentioned earlier, that we're still pushing hard on the rate side because we are not at rate adequacy.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then -- so as far as your professional liability book is concerned particularly, I mean, I think that one is one where, I think, you've done a great job getting rate and certainly the profile of the book has improved significantly. But that one in particular, you're growing now and it looks like if all that development in that segment is in professional liability, you're still right at around 100%. So is that -- I mean, now, I'm guessing that the good business that you're writing and keeping, and then the bad business that you're -- or the less good business, I should say, that you're taking a lot of rate on and maybe losing some of, is going to allow you to bring that number down more rapidly than it's come down so far. Is that fair?","John D. Finnegan","Let me talk. This is a little nuance. I mean, the fact is that we did have some positive development in surety, to begin with. So we're probably running high 90s accident year combined ratio right now. But you shouldn't compare that to the first 2 quarters. It's a little bit better, but a lot of that is seasonal in expenses, and it's a point here, point there. But it's not going to improve during the current year because we don't get enough feedback. We establish it based on what we think rate will be, what we think loss trends will be. We get very little data on the current accident year. So it's kind of what it is. It's running 98 now. Now if I look at it compared to last year, our loss ratio is about 4 points better than the same quarter last year. So that's an improvement. I looked at the rates we're getting and what we see is very manageable all of a sudden, much more manageable loss-cost trends. And I think that we're talking about -- we're hoping that by next year, we'll be in the mid-90s on an accident year based in professional liability. Now time will tell if we get the kind of the rate increases we're getting this year, we should definitely be there. That's a pretty significant improvement. And while we'd like to be in the low 90s, this is a line that we try to reserve appropriately for and precisely for. But it is a line, 7 years, we've run pretty substantial favorable development in this line. So one could argue we do end up -- we're a pretty conservative company. In terms of growth, I wouldn't get overwhelmed. Growth was 4% in the third quarter. It's been 2% year-to-date. That's hardly a heck of a lot of growth. What you're talking about is that we're getting 8 points a rate. So 8 points of rate and 2 points of growth is not growing a lot. Now to be fair, we're not getting 8 points of rate worldwide. We're probably getting 6. But it's still a lot more than the 4% growth even. And so we're not really -- and this business isn't growing that much. And we've gone through a number of years, it was a negative growth. So the answer is we hope to grow it a little bit more. We think that this business will perform better than maybe we're booking it at. You won't see that in the current accident year. You're seeing some improvement in the current versus last accident year. And I think you'll see some fairly significant improvement going forward next year in our accident year combined ratios in professional liability.","Operator","We'll now go to Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","The question is, if you would explain more sort of the transition, I think from -- it sounds like it has been through a particularly notable sort of profit take -- sorry, rate taking at the expense of volume over the past couple of years. You're starting to shift -- obviously, you're still shrinking units, though the new business ratio is coming back up. It sounds like maybe you're going to be a bit more balanced in the rate taking. Should we think about you guys actually maintaining flat units or actually having a chance to grow in CCI and CSI next year for 2014?","Paul J. Krump","This is Paul, Josh. Why don't I take a stab at that. First of all, when we talk about the improvement in the new-to-loss ratios, I want to be fair and point out, being candid here, that some of that improvement is definitely coming from the increase in retention. Clearly as the renewal book has improved, and we've done all of that calling, we see a need -- a desire to be able to hang on to a lot more business. So that certainly is something that we're mindful of. That said, I don't want to put too much emphasis on that, because on any given month or even a quarter when you start talking about professional liability or CCI lines, you could lose a deal or a couple of large deals, and that can move your number around a little bit. But clearly, as the markets continue to improve, and they are, there are more opportunities for us to be able to find good business. When you look at Worker's Compensation as an example within CCI, half of the new business that we wrote came from accounts that we already have the package in auto and comp on. So we're able to round out as Workers' Compensation rates move up. The other half, obviously, is coming from rate increases on the rentals. But clearly the mark in some lines is coming closer to what we think is good pricing, solid pricing. We'll take advantage of that whenever we can.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","It's helpful. I wonder if we could also just follow up on the point, I think, John made earlier about pricing isn't going to go from 8% to 0. One of the dynamics I've been interested in is just simply just the fourth quarter is the first time that customers who started getting rate increases of any material size in the third quarter -- or the fourth quarter of 2011. So it's the third time that you have to ask for rate increase. And I'm wondering how you're communicating around that issue with your underwriters, and then conversation to brokers, how you're sort of -- how to keep everybody focused on driving pricing while at these sort of mid-to high single-digit levels that have been down for some time.","John D. Finnegan","Let me clarify my comment. I didn't mean rates gone from 8% to 0, I don't think they are. But I think, the answer to the question as would we expect to see lower rate increases plus the improved quality of our book? And I'd say, yes, we would expect directionally to see them. I said, but the quality of the book only is going to bear a certain burden in that area. You're not going to see rates go from 8% to 0 just because you have an improved quality of the book. That would take a significant swing in the market. And I'll turn it over to Paul for the second part of the question.","Paul J. Krump","Yes, Josh, I spent a lot of time with clients and brokers out there, and clearly, this is the topic, \"OMG, well now we're going into whatever the third round of rate increase or something.\" Not to sound glib, but I don't remember that conversation ever happening after 7 rounds of rate decreases in the past. So that's the first thing that I kind of toss out there. But again, the better underwriters are really doing a lot of segmentation of their book of business, and they're looking back at the history of the account. You walk into a client and an agent, and you explain to them what the history of their customer has been, where their price decreases have been over the years, where the price increases have been, what has actually happened. Then you start talking to people honestly about loss-cost trend. And maybe you'd be in California and talking to people about their Workers' Comp and pointing out to them that the loss-cost trend there is in the high single digits. So they know what's happening in the marketplace. They know what's happening with the weather. They know about low interest rates. So you try to build on the fact that you're being logical and you're trying to be fair in what you're asking for. I would say overwhelmingly, our producers and agents support us, a lot of the clients obviously, support us, but you don't win them all.","Operator","We'll now go to Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wanted to just ask about the guidance today relative to January. As I look at it, you guys are in the midpoint of your current range of $1.35, above the midpoint of the January range, maybe $0.30-something is due to catastrophes coming in lower than you thought. So perhaps that's some degree of luck. But really there's a $1 or so where you guys are just beating numbers and it doesn't seem to be in share count net investment income, it's just underwriting. And so my question is, what -- relative to what you thought the world will be in January, what has broken so demonstrably better in the projection versus today? And then obviously, what does that mean to '14, how do we think about '14 as well?","John D. Finnegan","I think in broad terms, we've got a benefit from cats, you're right. We achieved rate, which we weren't as certain going into the year we would get the kind of rate we got, and that was an improvement, so margin expansion continued. Also as we said on a number of calls, we've benefited from some good fortune in the terms of losses being below trend lines, whether it be non-cat-related weather, fire losses especially -- you see it in homeowners, to some degree you've seen a terrific year in terms of large losses in the property line. We just had a substantial benefit. So some of that is luck. And also you've seen a lot of development, development at last year's level, which you probably wouldn't have -- we definitely didn't anticipate coming into the year. I mean, in 2014, I think you got you make your own judgments. I mean, you guys can project out margin expansion, although you only have half of the puzzle. You have this year's rates, half of which will go into 2014. You have to anticipate what 2014 rates will be to come up with a margin expansion idea. You probably have to believe that there's going to be some reversion to the norm in terms of large losses and good fortune. And you can make your own judgment on where favorable development should be. I assume 2014 will be a good year, but I can't -- other than directionally, I really -- we've got a lot of good things happen this year. Don't know if they'll all happen again next year. But the baseline trend, the longer-term trend is positive, at least in today's mark with the rate we're getting.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right, right. The biggest thing, John, I'm trying to get is just the sizing of the non-cat large losses that you mentioned. Any kind of sense year-to-date, how much better that's been in terms of combined ratio points?","John D. Finnegan","No, it hasn't been inconsequential. I mean, it depends if you add homeowners and things like that. But probably a point, I'd say, I mean, I'm just -- maybe a point.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So yes, again, so you have your normal cat load, you have your point there, and then you start to build it off of that for next year, okay. That makes sense. Next would be maybe for Ricky, just on that investment income. It's kind of coming into where you said it was going to be. At what point can we actually see the net investment income declines begin to abate? Just how does the role work from what's coming off versus what's going in?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes, it's obviously -- it's a little complicated because there are a lot of other pieces to the puzzle than just the reinvestment yields. You have cash flows. We had the buyback and things impact that. And without giving you specifics, I think, as we've looked out, I think certainly we would expect that over the next year and maybe the next 2 years, you will see a decline still in investment income, but it will be at a much smaller percentage decline than it was this year as the portfolio has been rolling over the last few years and the overall book yield has been coming down as it relates to the fact we've been reinvesting for 2 or 3 years now at lower rates. So you will still see a bit of a decline but it should be a smaller decline than what we've seen this year.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Very clear. And then last is just on the buyback. Is there any level at which you wouldn't buy back your stock? I mean, the shares look to be about 1.5x book or so and the valuation keeps rising?","Richard G. Spiro","Always a good thing that the valuation keep rising. We have no bright lines regarding valuation and there's no single price or multiple that currently makes us uncomfortable. In our view, the intrinsic value of our shares, which ultimately impacts our share repurchase decisions, is a moving target as macroeconomic industry and certainly company-specific dynamics continue to evolve, and it's good stewards of our balance sheet. We constantly review our alternative investment opportunities and other uses for excess capital. And we understand that at some share price level, it may theoretically make more sense to pursue other capital management options. At this time, however, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And we still perceive attractive economic opportunities in repurchasing our shares at the current stock price. So the answer is we don't see that point where we sit today.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So steady as she goes there. But you mentioned other things you can d,o, sort of, to my mind there's a special dividend. What are some of the other things you could do with excess capital if the valuation went to some insane level?","Richard G. Spiro","Well, obviously, you mentioned that. I mean, clearly the #1 priority for us, and anyone running a business, would be to reinvest in the business if we saw significant growth opportunities. We happen to be in a position today where we think we have enough excess capital to support any growth in the business, as well as continue our buyback programs. But should we find ourselves in a period where we see significant growth opportunities, we would certainly be willing to reinvest. Now bear in mind, we went through the whole rate adequacy discussion earlier. So where we are today, there's certainly -- while there may be some growth opportunities on the margin, we certainly don't see that significant growth opportunity. And then lastly, one that John has talked about in the past, mergers and acquisitions, that's not something that's high on our priority list. So our priorities would be to invest in the business and then return any excess capital to shareholders.","Operator","Moving on to Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","The way your competitors mentioned new competition in surety, and I want to know if you had seen the same thing. They were complaining about some levels of competition, maybe a couple of crazy competitors. Are you seeing that with your business?","Paul J. Krump","People always love to complain about the competition. This is Paul. We certainly know that there's some new entrants into the marketplace in surety. We really -- we're not into the homebuilders market. We're not into the smaller guys. Our surety book is really a pristine list of contractors at the high end. There's really only a handful of players that the specialty surety brokers go to, and we're one of them. So no, we really -- we know they're out there, but we really don't bump into them. And they're not used as stalking horses for the major contractors -- the major contractors don't look to them.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Terrific. And then I want to ask on the new accounting system that the FASB and the IASB has proposed. Do you have any thoughts and will you be writing a comment letter?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes, and yes. We've obviously filed the project over the years, and we've been very actively engaged with it. Like many other companies in our industry, we previously indicated to FASB that we believe the U.S. GAAP accounting and reporting model for P&C companies works well and is understandable for both preparers and users of the financial statements of insurance companies, and we continue to hold that same position. And we are concerned about the possible loss of usability and transparency that may result from this proposed guidance, and we'll continue to share our concerns on this proposal with FASB. And hopefully that addresses your question.","John D. Finnegan","How about 2 more questions?","Operator","Next, we'll go to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. John, you had talked about for the 9 months that, obviously, it was a bit of luck with non-cat weather or large fire losses. Did that aid this quarter's results at all? Or was this quarter more in line with what you have thought?","John D. Finnegan","I would say in the homeowners business, the gap closed a little bit in the third quarter, so it wasn't unusually low either in non-cat-related weather or fire. It's a little bit better year-to-date. But property and marine still benefited from low large losses. We want to take credit for some of it. We've got some good underwriting action, but you can't take credit for all of it.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Fair enough. And then the other question was, on the favorable reserve development, I'm wondering if you could give us a bit more color as far as what lines of business and what accident years that was coming from?","John D. Finnegan","Yes, our overall favorable development, it's pretty easy, it was broadly favorable across all the accident years this quarter and actually for the -- and for the 9 months, too, including the 9 months, with strong contribution for accident year 2012 driven by much-better-than-expected results in commercial property.","Richard G. Spiro","And, Jay, if you want a little more color behind each of the business units. In CPI, all 3 of our lines were favorable in the quarter. In CCI, all 4 lines contributed some favorable development, and most of the favorable development was in the property, marine and package area, including some favorable cat development. In CSI, both professional liability and surety were favorable. And the favorable development in professional liability was driven by D&O and fiduciary. And as I mentioned, in our reinsurance assumed business, it was an insignificant amount this quarter.","Operator","Now we'll go to Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just 1 or 2 quick ones here. First Paul, just wondering the casualty combined ratio kind of ticking up the last couple of quarters and is at kind of highest level it's been in looks like a couple of years. Anything going on there?","Paul J. Krump","Yes, let me start by pointing out that the year-ago third quarter result of 89.2 in casualty was unusually good compared to the surrounding quarters. So we've got a tough comp there. And that was good due to substantial amount of favorable development in the Excess\/Umbrella flask. We saw some continued favorable development in Excess\/Umbrella in this year's third quarter but just not as much. In addition, in this quarter, we did see some largely offsetting adverse development in the other portions of casualty, and that was really driven particularly by the general lability class, where we had 1 claim with some large unexpected development on it. So that's really what's behind all that.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And just want to go over to the personal lines. On homeowners insurance, I'm just curious, are we getting close to where we're kind of rate adequacy and are we -- have we seen any kind of policy in-force growth there, or that kind of been flattish declining? Are we in a position where we might start to see that grow again?","Dino E. Robusto","Yes, so as I indicated, our policy in-force count growth continued. It was up on homeowners and up on 3 points. And in terms of our rate adequacy, we're going to continue to fly [ph] on average about mid-single-digit increases for homeowners, but low single digits for auto. And obviously, these vary granularly by geography. And that's really just a function of the fact that we've had a lot of increased weather and catastrophe activity. And as Paul indicated earlier every year you've got your loss-cost trend above 4 points running on homeowners. So we're going to continue to push that forward. Our retention, as I indicated in our opening comments, holding up really well in auto, and even on the homeowners, really over the course of multiple years of price increases. It's really only moved down less than a point. So we think in the face of our rate increases, we're holding our own really effectively and we'll keep pushing it.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Has the competitive landscape increased at all in that area, I'm curious, out there, and there's a bunch of guys?","Dino E. Robusto","Yes, there's been a couple of new entrants in the high-net worth space over the last few years. And clearly it's generating a little bit more competition. Having said that, I think it's important to realize that the high net worth business is really -- the majority of it is not with the small number of high net worth specialists including us, Chubb. Rather it's with a lot of even direct writers, more likely simply driven by the fact of their sheer size. So we focus on delivering our superior products and service really across this broader competitive landscape rather than focusing on any one competitor. We've been very pleased with our strong performance. Notwithstanding really any change in the competitive landscape. So steady as she goes.","John D. Finnegan","Thank you, everyone.

Those listening after July 24, 2014, should please note that the information and forecast provided in this recording will not necessarily be updated and it is possible that information will no longer be current.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Finnegan.","John D. Finnegan","","Thank you for joining us. Chubb produced solid results in the second quarter of 2014, we generated operating income per share of $17, net income per share $2.03. Our results benefited from strong premium growth of 5% ex-currency and our highest level of retention for commercial and professional liability in three years.","In addition, we enjoyed excellent profitability in our long-tail lines of business such as professional liability, casualty and workers compensation. However, our results of the second quarter were adversely impacted by the performance of our short-tail property lines. We had unusually high levels of large fire losses in our commercial and personal books of property business.","In addition, severe weather in the United States resulted in elevated non- catastrophe losses, as well as catastrophe losses of $0.39 per share. The market remained stable in the second quarter, as evidenced by the continued increase in the rates. We are pleased that we\u2019re able to secure our mid single-digit increases in our U.S. rate change metrics in all our businesses.","With respect to our commercial and professional liability businesses, well the size of the increases was slightly less than in the first quarter. We\u2019re very pleased that we are able to obtain these increases and still achieve higher levels of renewal rentention. We produced the second quarter combined ratio of 90, including 4.8 points of cats.","Excluding cats, our combined ratio was 85.2 compared to an exceptionally low 80.9 in the second quarter last year. That 80.9 last year was the best ex-cat combined ratio we\u2019ve had any quarter in the past six years.","Annualized operating ROE for the second quarter was 11.3%, while annualized GAAP ROE was 12.2%. GAAP book value per share at June 30, 2014 was $68.60 an increase of 6% from year end 2013. Our capital position is excellent and we made progress on our share repurchase program during the quarter.","For the first six months of 2014, we produced net income per share of $3.83 and operating income per share of $3.20. As a result of our performance in the first half, we have reduced our guidance for full-year 2014 operating income per share to a range of $6.75 to $6.95 from the $7.10 to $7.40 per share range, we provided in January. Ricky will discuss our revised guidance later.","And now for more details on our operating performance will start with Dino, who will discuss Chubb\u2019s commercial and specialty insurance operations.","Dino E. Robusto","","Thanks, John. Chubb Commercial and Chubb Specialty insurance both had strong performance in the second quarter characterize by excellent underwriting result in most lines of business particularly our long tail lines. We also had great retention, which as we stated last quarter was our focus and a modest increase in new business allowing us to improve our overall growth rate.","Starting with CCI, second quarter net written premiums were up 3% to $1.4 billion. While the commercial market is always competitive, our value added underwriting driven approach continues to work well. CCI\u2019s second quarter combined ratio was 93.3% compared to 89.9% in the corresponding quarter a year ago. The impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 4.9 point of the combined ratio, compared to 8.1 points in the second quarter of 2013.","Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI\u2019s second combined ratio was 88.4% in 2014 compared to 81.8% in 2013. The deterioration in CCI's ex-cat combined ratio from a year ago was entirely explainable by the property and Marine line of business. Our other three CCI lines performed well, in fact, casualty and workers' comp had much better results than in the year ago second quarter.","In the second quarter of this year, the Property and Marine business experienced significantly higher than usual ex-cat loss activity. This line had a combined ratio, excluding catastrophes of 97.4%, which was 34 points worse and the extremely low second quarter of 2013. And if we consider a longer historical perspective, this year\u2019s second quarter property and Marine ex-cat combined ratio was about 15 points worse than our five year average. At current earned premium levels, this equates to approximately $50 million. ","This elevated loss activity was driven by a combination of several large fire losses and some non-cat weather related losses. As we have pointed out in the past, property losses can fluctuate substantially in any one quarter. The second quarter last year was an unusually low outlier for the Property and Marine business. With an ex-cat combined ratio of 63.1%. In fact, that was the best ex-cat combined ratio a 9.5 year, whereas this year the second quarter was an unusually high outlier.","We have carefully analyzed the losses in the quarter and found no trends or issues that warrant any change in our underwriting strategy. Partially offsetting the property results was in almost ten point improvement in the casualty combined ratio the 85.3% which was the best performance for casualty in 12 quarters. We also had about a two point improvement in workers' compensation combined ratio, an outstanding 84.5% reinforcing our status as one of the most profitable workers\u2019 comp underwriters in the industry.","In our first quarter conference call we mentioned that in light of the rate increases over the past several years we were focusing on retaining profitable business and taking advantage of better price new business in this focus favorably impacted our growth rate. While we are always looking to call accounts where we cannot secure appropriate rates and terms and conditions, our underwriting and pricing actions over the past few years have resulted and there being fewer accounts that needed to be called. This benefited both retention and the new the lost ratio.","Indeed, CCI's second quarter retention in the U.S. increased to 87% its highest level in ten quarters and up from 85% in the first quarter of 2014. We achieved this two point increase in retention over the first quarter while still securing average U.S. renewal rate increases of 4%. Outside the U.S., CCI's average renewal rate increases continued in the low single-digits.","With respect to new business, we continue to penetrate our target market segment where our unique expertise and products and services afford us the greatest opportunity to achieve our required risk adjusted margin. CCI's new to last business ratio in the U.S. was 1.2 to 1 compared to 0.9 to 1 in the first quarter of 2014.","Turning now to Chubb Specialty insurance net written premiums were up 5% in the second quarter to $655 million. CCI's second quarter combined ratio was an outstanding 78.7% in 2014, versus 86% in 2013. For the professional liability portion of CSI, which represents the majority of the portfolio, net written premiums were up 4% to $572 million. The combined ratio for professional liability improved to 83.2% from 91.9% in the second quarter of 2013 and from 84.6% in the first quarter of 2014.","The continued improvement in the combined ratio over time reflects our discipline underwriting and culling action, aided by our advanced analytic and predictive modeling, skillful portfolio management and the compound effect of the price increases we have achieved over the last few years. Renewal retention for professional liability in the U.S. in the second quarter improved to 88% from 85% in the first quarter of this year.","As our rate taking in underwriting actions have earned into our renewable portfolio as is the case with CCI, we have been increasingly focused on retaining our profitable renewal business, all the while securing a strong 6% average renewal rate increase. In markets outside the U.S., renewal rate increases remain consistent with prior quarters rising by low single-digits.","Our new to loss business ratio for professional liability in the second quarter was 1.2 to 1 up from 0.9 to 1 in the first quarter of 2014 and 0.8 to 1 in the fourth quarter of 2013. The steady improvement in this metric is driven both by less loss business and we focus on retaining our profitable renewal business, as well as our success in writing better priced new business available in the market after several years of industry rate increases and underwriting action.","One final note on our professional liability business. Several weeks ago the Supreme Court of the United States rendered its long-awaited decision in the Halliburton case. We view the ruling as a middle of the road outcome and not unexpected, while it will take a long time to know the full impact, if any on the frequency and severity of securities class actions, at this stage our perspective is that the ruling is a mild positive, but should do little to change the current D&O landscape with respect to underwriting or pricing.","Turning now to the surety portion of the CSI book. Net written premiums were up 8% to $83 million. This compares to a decline of 13% in the first quarter of 2014 and was driven by an increase in U.S. construction activity among a few of our larger customers. Surety is a lumpy business from both a premium growth and a profitability standpoint. ","The combined ratio was 45.3 compared to 42.1 in the second quarter of 2013. Despite the occasional large loss, our expertise in customer selection, underwriting and portfolio diversification, has enabled us to achieve outstanding long-term results in our surety line making this business very attractive to us.","In conclusion, the results of the second quarter demonstrate that continued success of our long standing commercial and specialty underwriting strategy. In any one quarter the profile of accounts that are up for renewal can vary and as we have noted in the past, the change in premium growth from one quarter to another is sometimes attributable more to the renewal or non-renewal of a few large accounts than to any underlying trend. ","Nevertheless, we are confident that our underwriters will continue to manage the rate retention dynamic, in order to strive for the optimal balance based on the underwriting characteristics of each insured. It is this commitment to underwriting discipline along with building strong relationship with the best agents and brokers in the industry in providing our customers with unparalleled claims service that should enable us to continue to grow our business profitably over time.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Paul, who will review our results for CPI and corporate wide claims.","Paul J. Krump","Thanks Dino. Considering the elevated level of homeowners losses Chubb Personal Insurance turned in a very good quarter. CPI net written premiums increased 5% to $1.2 billion and CPI produced a combined ratio of 92.7 compared to 89.6 in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes on CPI second quarter combined ratio was 7.5% in 2014. In the second quarter a year ago the cat impact on CPI's combined ratio was 12.7 points. On an ex-cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 85.2 in the second quarter of 2014 compared to 76.9 in the second quarter of 2013.","Homeowners' premiums grew 4% in the quarter and the combined ratio was 92.2 compared to 86.9 in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 12.1 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the second quarter of 2014, compared to 20.1 points in the second quarter of 2013. Excluding the impact of catastrophes the 2014 second quarter, homeowners combined ratio was 80.1, compared to an extraordinary 66.8% in the same period a year ago, which was the lowest homeowners ex-cat combined ratio of any quarter in the previous eight years.","As in the first quarter this year CPI experienced an elevated level of homeowners\u2019 fire losses in the second quarter. For comparison, U.S. fire losses in the second quarter of 2014 accounted for 13 points of the overall worldwide homeowners loss ratio, versus only five points in the second quarter of 2013.","In addition the effect of U.S. non-cat weather related losses contributed about two points more of the loss ratio than in the corresponding quarter of 2013. Together the impact of U.S. fire and non-cat weather related losses accounted for ten points of the year-over-year second quarter ex-cat combined ratio delta for homeowners.","Looking at our average combined impact of U.S. fire and non-cat weather related losses on homeowners over the past five years, the impact in the second quarter of this year was about six points worse than the average. At the current earned premium levels, this equates to about $40 million. Fire and weather losses do not occur in a linear fashion. We believe our book as well underwritten and that the losses will average out over time.","Homeowners\u2019 rate and exposure premium increases totaled 7% in the U.S. in the second quarter. The same is what we achieved in the first quarter of this year, as well as in the second quarter of 2013. Apart from the dollar impact of rate taking we continue to implement a greater pricing sophistication as our ability to match price to specific risks improves thus, enhancing the quality of our portfolio. The use of sophisticated analytics is also helping us retain more of our best customers. We believe this suite of enhanced tools will continue to drive profitable growth in the years to come.","Personal auto premium growth was flat for the quarter, auto premiums increased in the U.S. and decreased outside the U.S. driven by currency fluctuations. The combined ratio was 95.6 compared to 95.3 in the second quarter of 2013. Policy retention in the U.S. in the second quarter was 90% for homeowners and 89% for auto. Both of which were essentially unchanged from the first quarter 2014. In other personal, which includes our accident, personal excess liability and yacht lines, premiums increased 10% and the combined ratio was 93.1 compared to 93.3 in the second quarter a year ago. Growth was driven by accident and personal excess.","Turning now to corporate-wide claims. Catastrophe losses for the second quarter totaled $146 million before tax. There were 13 cat events in the United States and two in Canada. The events included wind, flood and hail, and affected customers in 30 states and three Canadian provinces. The vast majority of our cat losses were in the U.S., and were skewed to CPI. As we are all aware the season of hurricanes and heighten wildfires is upon us.","As evidenced by hurricane Arthur in the Carolinas, as well as the wildfires that are burning in Northwestern United States. Thus far, we have had only a handful of small claims from these events. That said, it takes just one significant event to create intense demand for the claims services, which are the hallmark of the Chubb brand. Therefore, each year we thoroughly review our cat preparedness protocols to ensure they are current and we incorporate lessons learned from prior events.","And with that, I will turn it over Ricky who will review our financial results in more detail.","Richard G. Spiro"," ","Thanks Bob. As usual I will discuss our financial results for the quarter and I will also review our updated earnings guidance. Looking first at our operating results, we had underwriting income of $278 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 4% to $275 million, due once again to lower reinvestment rates in both our domestic and international fixed maturity portfolio.","Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $125 million or $0.33 per share after-tax of which $0.15 per share came from our alternative investment. For comparison, in the second quarter of 2013 we had net realized investment gains before tax of $179 million or $0.44 per share after tax of which $0.12 per share came from alternative investments.","You will recall that in the second quarter of last year, we also recognized the gain of $0.21 per share related to the merger of Alterra Capital and Markel Corporation. As a reminder, unlike some of our competitors, we do not include our share of the change in the net equity of our alternative investments and property and casualty investment income. We included a net realized investment gains and losses.","Unrealized depreciation before tax at June 30 was $2.6 billion compared to $2.2 billion at the end of the first quarter. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43.5 billion as of June 30, 2014. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is four years and the average credit rating is AA3.","We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At June 30, our holding company portfolio had $2 billion of investment including approximately $575 million of short-term investment. Book value per share under GAAP at June 30, 2014 was $68.60 compared to $64.83 at year end 2013 and $60.76 a year ago. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available for sale fixed maturities at amortized cost was $63.87 compared to $61.86 at 2013 year end and $57.03 a year ago.","As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the second quarter of 2014 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows. In CPI, we had about $50 million, CCI had about $70 million, CSI at $80 million and the runoff reinsurance assumed business had none, bringing our total favorable development to about $165 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the second quarter combined ratio of almost 5.5 points overall.","For comparison, in the second quarter of 2013 we had about $215 million of favorable development for the company overall including $40 million in CPI, $115 million in CCI, $55 million in CSI and $5 million in runoff reinsurance assumed business. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the second quarter of 2013 was about seven points. For the second quarter of 2014, our ex-cat accident year combined ratio was 90.6 compared to 88 in last year's second quarter.","During the second quarter of 2014 our loss reserves increased by $28 million, including an increase of $35 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $7 million for the runoff reinsurance assumed business. The overall increase in reserves reflects an increase of $21 million related to catastrophes and the impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $10 million.","Turning to capital management, during the second quarter we repurchased 4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $375 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $92.95 per share. At the end of the second quarter, we had $823 million available for share repurchases under our current authorization. And as we have said previously, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2015.","Before turning it back to John, let me provide you with some additional details on our updated guidance. We've revised our guidance for operating income per share for the full-year to a range of $6.75 to $6.95 on the range of $7.10 to $7.40 that we provided in January. As John mentioned, we\u2019ve reduced our guidance primarily because of our operating results in the first half of this year.","Our outlook for the second half of the year remains essentially unchanged from January, when we provided our initial guidance. As a result, at the mid point of our updated guidance, we expect our ex-cat combined ratio in the second half of the year to improve by about 1.5 points from our actual results for the first half of 2014, which was impacted by an unusually high level of large buyer in non-cat weather related losses. Our revised guidance is based upon the following underlying assumptions.","We expect our combined ratio for the full year 2014 to be in the range of 90% to 91% compared to the January guidance assumption of 89% to 90%. This change reflects our actual operating results in the first six months of the year. We are assuming five points of catastrophe losses for the second half of 2014. Based on the 5.7 points of actual cat losses we had in the first half, our assumption for the full-year calculates to 5.3 points, compared to the 5 point cat assumption in our original guidance.","For those who would like to make a higher or lower cat assumption the impacted each percentage point of catastrophe losses for the full-year on operating income per share is approximately $0.33. We expect net written premiums for the full-year to increase 2% to 4%, with an insignificant impact of foreign currency translation. This assumption is unchanged from our January 2014 January 2014 guidance. And we expect property and casualty investment income after tax to decline 4% to 6%, which is also unchanged from our January guidance.","Finally, we assume 244 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full-year compared to 245 million in our January guidance.","And now, I will turn it back to John.","John D. Finnegan","Thanks Ricky. Despite an unusually high level of fire and weather related losses, we produced solid earnings in the second quarter of this year, which included a number of very positive developments. With respect to the U.S. market we enjoyed mid-single digit rate increases. All increase in overall retention to levels better than we have enjoyed for a number of years.","In addition our new to lost business ratios improved. The upshot was ex currency premium growth of 5% in the quarter, versus 1% in the first quarter of this year. Profitability of our professional line business continued to improve professional liability, I'm sorry, reflecting rate increases in the underwriting initiatives we begin to undertake at the end of 2011.","Our combined ratio and professional liability of 83.9% for the first six months of 2014. Represented about a 5 point improvement from calendar year 2013 and almost 13 point improvement from calendar year 2012. In fact the 83.9% posted in the first six months of this year is better than our professional liability performance in any full calendar year since 2007. We also enjoyed terrific performance in other long tail lines.","For example, our 85.3 combined ratio in casualty was the best quarter we\u2019ve had three years. Equally as impressive was workers compensation were combined ratio in each of the first two quarters of 2014 were the best we have recorded in any quarter in about six years. Our reserve position remains strong as reflected in the 5.8 point a favorable development we had in a quarter.","And finally, during the first six months of 2014 book value per share increased 6% from year-end and we will return more than $1 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and cash dividends. On the minus side, our second quarter earnings were significantly dampened by an unusually high level of fire and non-cat whether related losses. And both commercial property and homeowners business.","As we have mentioned in the past, wide fluctuation in losses in these areas from quarter-to-quarter are generally a function of the presence or absence of good fortune. Nevertheless, we reviewed these losses exhaustively on a case-by-case basis to ensure that they do not reflect any important underlying trend. So we expect to reversion to the mean overtime. And as Ricky noted an updated guidance we assume some improvement in the loss experience in the second half of this year.","With that, I will open the line to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Amit Kumar from Macquarie.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Group Limited","","Thanks and good afternoon. Just two quick questions on I guess the guidance and the discussion on pricing. You mentioned better priced new business few times. What is the approximate delta between the new business pricing and renewal business pricing?","Dino E. Robusto","","Hi, its Dino. As we've always mentioned, it's not surprising that renewals are always going to perform better than new lines. We have an ability to review lost until modify terms and conditions as needed. Usually results in reduced losses. And so we are always careful in our new business selection process and that's why we just focus on the target niches that we did where we have developed some expertise and we see a little bit of contraction in that gap, but it\u2019s really just a function of new business always going to be a little bit less than renewals, there is always going to be a little bit of that gap, we just stick to what we know in our target markets that we like and where we have expertise and we are able to write a little bit more in new business in the second quarter. Now again, it's still at levels that are much lower than what they have been several years ago so just to keep that I guess the new business.","Richard G. Spiro","Volume.","Dino E. Robusto","Yes, the volume, yes, yes.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Group Limited","Okay, got it. The other question I had is on the guidance and premiums. Just based on your comments, it seems that you're probably incrementally more satisfied with the price adequacy of our accounts or I guess the buckets which need rate increases. I would have imagined that seven months from the initial guidance probably you would have ended up thinking about retaining more and hence the NPW guidance might have changed, but its essentially unchanged seven months from when it was announced. Can you just maybe just explain that to me?","Richard G. Spiro","","I guess \u2013 it's Ricky, I'll try. I guess as we think about that the premium growth when we look at what we did in the first half and what we were thinking about when we came into the year, we were probably a little bit lighter in the first half of the year on margin than we had thought given in the first quarter this year we had premium growth of about zero and 1% on an ex-currency basis. So if I\u2019m answering your question correctly, you probably would get a little incremental growth in the second quarter in order to get from where we were for the second half to get from where we were in the first half for the year to say the midpoint of the guidance. Does that help?","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Group Limited","","Yes. I just wanted to asking was that Dino, are you now with seven months elapsed are you more satisfied with price adequacy of accounts than what you might have imagined at Jan, when you had come out with the guidance.","Dino E. Robusto","Maybe \u2013 its Dino, maybe I can just take a look at \u2013 answer it from just overall rate adequacy and how we look at that if I can and I\u2019ll give you a little color and hopefully this answers its, but I don\u2019t want to talk about rate adequacy in terms of specific percentage of the book, because that\u2019s a little too over simplistic, right the book is very dynamic, its diversify, sophisticated, geographically diverse and also risk characteristics of an account or set of accounts can change in anyone year.","Having said that clearly after the compound rate increases we've achieved over the last several years as well as the underwriting actions, it\u2019s important to keep that in mind. We clearly feel that the book has improved in terms of rate adequacy, but there is still are portions of the book that need rate and you have to keep in mind that this happens really at the individual account level. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, our underwriters are focused on managing the rate retention dynamic based on the underwriting characters of each individual accounts and so you still see some variation on the individual accounts as an example, in the second quarter, in the top quintile by premium rate increasing we\u2019re still getting greater than a 15% increase and in the lowest quintile we were giving about a 5% decrease. You're still seeing that variation, but clearly bottom line, after several years both of rate increase and the underwriting action the book has an improved in terms of rate adequacy.","John D. Finnegan","","I would just point out though it is a moving target and more rates was gotten over the first six months, improved rate adequacy on the other side. Interest rates and therefore investment income prospects are down from the end of last year you might remember interest rates are 50 points lower than they were at year end. There are headwinds here too.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Group Limited","","You answered my question I apologize, I phrased the question poorly. Thank you.","Operator","","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jay Gould from Barclays.","Jay B. Gould \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","Thank you and good afternoon. I want to ask you given that we\u2019ve seen the underlined combined ratio tick up to the low 90% range from kind of high 80% level, should we anticipate going forward that low 90s is probably more reasonable run rate and that\u2019s excluding cats in prior development?","Richard G. Spiro","","Yes Jay it is Ricky. I don't think that is the correct assumption. If you look at the guidance that the updated guidance and as we mentioned on the call, we are expecting some improvement in the combined ratio performance in the second half of the year. So I wouldn\u2019t make that assumption. And in fact.","John D. Finnegan","","I\u2019m sorry you go ahead.","Richard G. Spiro","All right in fact it\u2019s as I mentioned when I talked in my remarks, when we came into the year, if you look at what our initial guidance was on an ex-cat combined ratio basis, you do the math between what the midpoint of our guidance is now versus what we had in the first half in essence we believe that we\u2019re going to have the same performance in the second half as we'd assumed we started the year.","Jay B. Gould \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","So you would attribute the underlying combined ratio in the first half being in the low 90s more to these\u2026","John D. Finnegan","Definitely.","","Jay B. Gould \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","","Number of fires and non-cat weather losses.","John D. Finnegan","Absolutely. If you look at the comparison to last year \u2013 to this year, last year we look at year-over-year comparison, you\u2019re talking, I mean \u2013 I think Paul kind of gave it, but you\u2019re talking $180 million deterioration due to fire and non-cat weather and then a commercial property in marine lines, that's on $6 million of premium that\u2019s a mouthful. At three points right there. And I guess for the second half our guidance is what 88 to 89, what's the second half guidance?","Richard G. Spiro","","We keep the year 90 to 91 and then and the second half is\u2026","John D. Finnegan","I want again doing on an ex-cat basis it would be something similar to the ex-cat combined ratio we assumed at the beginning of year which was about 80.5, calendar year.","Jay B. Gould \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","I see, okay. And then a separate issue, with regard to the Halliburton decision, I would have thought that could be more than a mild positive giving it has the ability to call the number of securities claims before they get the class certification. So wouldn't that meaningfully if not reduce the number of class actions and at least take down overall severity in defense costs?","John D. Finnegan","If it all worked out Jay but I think we have to watch and see how the courts rule following the Supreme Court decision here. It's not clear what kind of real threshold are applying in practical matters. So were not beating a wardroom, it's a great victory, we have to say, and there are some argument that it might increase defense costs on the other side. If courts take aggressive approach at our position it would help. But again, we'll have to see what happens here.","Jay B. Gould \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","The defendants have the ability to say well prove to what you actually relied on that statement, or that you didn't rely on that alleged fraud when you brought the stock.","Paul J. Krump","","Jay this is Paul, I will augment that a little bit by saying it\u2019s not just Halliburton you have got Omnicare, you got [indiscernible], you have got a number of decisions out there, and what really encourages us is that at first to at first to court continues to choose these cases right. So they a right to accept them or not and they're choosing to take them. I think that gives us a lot of hope. And second because these cases do present opportunities for the court to make changes that could benefit our insureds, the compounding effect of all of these cases could certainly be more than mildly positive. But taken on individual base I think you know, is characteristic of this mild positive for Halliburton is correct.","John D. Finnegan","Yes. And again Jay it was also in the context, I mean, that we didn\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change the marketplace in the near term, right. The people are going to wait.","Jay B. Gould \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.","I see. That\u2019s helpful thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.","Joshua C. Stirling \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Hi good evening. Thanks for taking the call. So as you guys are shifting from focusing on driving margins to really more about retention and putting and getting into growth mode, I thought I had asked a couple of more longer term questions on your posture with growth. Paul, think you mentioned you brought up a topic I hadn't heard you guys talk about before which was sophisticated analytics that that it was interested because I was think if you guys first and foremost of having a brand and its relationship stay good business selection to start off with.","I\u2019m wondering if you give us a sense of what Moore's behind the comment to what kinds of things you guys doing to integrate analytics in your strategy and may be where you think you stand compared to some of your competitors. And if you think that analytics can start to be a competitive advantage for you guys?","John D. Finnegan","Absolutely Josh I mean we\u2019ve talked before, I know Dino last year, for example, brought up our panorama of product and that is certainly taken our auto to a far more sophisticated level. We\u2019ve got many tiers there. Now remember, what we write in automobile isn\u2019t the same lets say some of the large direct writer's that have been using sophisticated analytics for a very long time.","That said, when we talk about our fleets of affluent or high net worth or high valued cars that type thing, these tools are very sophisticated in helping us a lot to retain the right business and to attract new business. The same thing can be said for our pricing tiers in our predicative models around the homeowners as well for the affluent. Now your point about our brand, our relationships with agents all of that comes into play, and the analytics are just one part of the tool, but they are not everything so, Dino you wanted to touch on the unified [ph].","Dino E. Robusto","Yes, just at the introduction of your question right, I mean our increased retention is increased retention of profitable business? As we are always focused on increasing our margin, so I don\u2019t want \u2013 I just want to clarify that point, but, just a talk a little bit about the analytics on our professional liability as an example there. Our strategy and our capabilities are good towards taking advantage of the wealth of experience in our tremendously rich data set of information that we have, having underwritten literally hundreds of thousands of professional liabilities, polices over roughly more than three decades.","So it\u2019s through to this expertise and this data mining of coverage, pricing, loss data, we've built proprietary underwriting an account ranking tools and these tools can be also supplemented with external data feeds and it's the proprietary analytical tools are then just one more arrow in the underwriters quiver for them to drop on when making renewal decisions. As Paul said, analytics are increasing in this industry, but where we see it as being a real competitive advantage for us because of the history of proprietary data that we have amassed overtime.","And the underwriters are very pleased with additional insight gained from these tools and we intend to continue to invest in this area.","John D. Finnegan","Yes and Josh not to beat it to death, but we not only use them on the front end underwriting side, but we are using in awful lot of tools on the back end, on the claim side as well. So for example some of our tools are predicative models around fraud detection in workers compensation, you are seeing that manifest itself into some of the spectacular world-class combined ratio in workers comp.","John D. Finnegan","Let me interrupt Josh, what Dino said. We are properly focused on profitability. We are happy with the growth we\u2019ve got in the second quarter; we didn\u2019t have much growth in the first quarter. Our accounts are in strong form, we want to retain more of the counts and we think that\u2019s certainly a stepping stone to more profitability, but we are not giving away any rate to do so, we are getting what the market will bear and what we need on the accounts.","Joshua C. Stirling \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","","Got it, that\u2019s really helpful. If I could ask just one another topic that\u2019s comes to mind a bit not sort of is internally focused but sort of more risk management and just sense of growth and how you think about risk return and the opportunity. Obviously, the markets changed a lot with changes to the reinsurance industry, smaller guys starting to try to take share and write more Florida business, more coastal opportunities. How do you guys think about the coast these days are you still sort of running from them and trying to play defense or is this something we could see you be serves a big opportunity for Chubb here?","Richard G. Spiro","","I\u2019ll mention the coastal piece here Josh, just because I think you're probably thinking along the homeowner side of it. And again I\u2019ll go back to what John just really emphasize around profitable growth, where we are seeing it on the homeowner side frankly is maybe we are seeing some customers that have exposure in Florida along the coast where heretofore we weren\u2019t able to necessarily take on that house, but given their spread of risk that they bring to us, not just in Florida but maybe in the Northeast and Illinois another places. We are able to use some reinsurance opportunistically to hang on to those types of customers or to even write more than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Dino I don\u2019t know if you want to touch anything commercially.","","Dino E. Robusto","","I\u2019ll point out that the cat modeling agencies have significantly reduced PMLs on the coastal areas which hasn't hurt either.","Joshua C. Stirling \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Vinay Misquith from Evercore.","Vinay G. Misquith \u2013 Evercore Group LLC","","Hello, good evening. The first question is the above average property and marine losses and the fire losses and the homeowners. We have seen that for a couple of quarters and I think you touched upon this in your remarks, in your opening remarks but if you could help us understand and if we see some sort of trend developing or is it just quarterly volatility?","John D. Finnegan","I think that in the first quarter we had very high non-cat weather related losses in homeowners that's because the weather was awful, but we\u2019d expected that the \u2013 this quarter we had somewhat higher non-cat related weather, fire losses kicked in, first quarter we really didn't have unusually high commercial and property and marine losses just the second quarter last year was so unusually low, 63 combined. This quarter, sometimes as you never know. The quarters are discrete on a piece of paper but things we roll forward.","We all loss experience was not very good in the second quarter, but we can't find any trend. Last year when I was on these calls and we had usually low losses and I certainly didn\u2019t talk about any trends in fact what I suggested you all was that you should not project or combined ratios in the future based on margin expansion of the base period last year, combined ratio last year because it was so low. Similarly, I don't think you should project anything out the next are off this years second quarter combined ratio because I think it's unusually high. You're talking way beyond what we normally have in way beyond we had second quarter.","Paul J. Krump","","Really this is Paul, if you look back on the homeowners side to 2009 and you can see another period where we had some anomalous losses. We've been reading high network homes now for 30 years and as we go back and we look at the history of this there have been periods where you to get that kind of misfortune of a rashes of some fires but as John mentioned we scrubbed each of these individual accounts to look for anything that we can learn from them and try to detect any trends, but at the end of the day, I think the conclusion is this is the insurance business.","Vinay G. Misquith \u2013 Evercore Group LLC","So that\u2019s helpful thank you. just to follow-up on the pricing and the competitive environment. If could you give us an update on the competitive environment out there? Thanks.","John D. Finnegan","Sure. We didn\u2019t categories it as clearly the market is competitive, but frankly, it usually is. On average, we would say that the pricing dynamics though in the markets are rational. We can always point to a always to a situation where you're going to scratch your head asking why competitor may have right and account at a low price but general we are seeing most of the pressure emerge on the most profitable account.","So if you're an account with longer-term profitability will on average its going to be priced much more aggressively than an insured with a similar operation that is historically less profitable or inherently tougher exposures which makes sense in particular after multiple years of rate increases. One area where we might question the rationality of pricing its around some large accounts.","Example a situation where you have a low six-figure property account versus a large seven figure similar property account, the latter is going to tend to have much more aggressive pricing even if to exposure to loss on the large one as far greater and this dynamic seems to be especially prevalent at least wholesaling ENS markets as we see it. So I guess for some you can conclude that the Lora the big premium is driving motivation quite frankly in our opinion size doesn\u2019t matter. Its really the price and the terms and conditions measured against the risk characteristics that we rely on.","And in fact if you look at our retention rate of these larger accounts its below our overall retention rate we just choose draw align in the sand. In professional liability I was mainly commercial but in professional liability you\u2019d to see same dynamics. The better businesses is being more aggressively priced however we also continue to see general acceptance in professional liability for meaningful price increases on those lines of business that have had particularly poor profitability over the years such as EPL and review the stability as encouraging.","So I guess I'd say that's against this kind of competitive back drop were pleased what our mid single digital average rate increase in both commercial and professional liability and combined with some of the highest level of retention so that\u2019s the general feel for the market. I hope that helps.","Vinay G. Misquith \u2013 Evercore Group LLC","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","","Thanks. One question maybe on other personal lines, so that picked up a bit, is that bundling or is there another effort or something else that's we seen that lift the couple of quarters here in the double-digits recently so I\u2019m just curious sort of what\u2019s been driving that and then just a follow-up. Thanks.","Dino E. Robusto","","No problem, Mike. Other personal is where we report our accident and health business, up little over 15% of that other personal the remainder than it\u2019s represented by personal excess any odd accident as I mentioned had the highest growth driven by travel accident coverage in the United States. Personal excess liability also grew, but that was fueled by both rate and exposure, on a year-to-date basis other personal move about 6% I think grew for at 6% for the entire year 2013.","so other personal growth had loss related little bit through out the year because if we have an additional subtraction of a single premium program so that can pretty much drive the growth in any one three month period of time, but I would just tell you that overall we\u2019re very optimistic about our opportunities in accidents and as well as personal excess and in last couple of months we\u2019ve seen some uptick in the yachts purchasing and mega yacht business that\u2019s good for us as well. That\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing out there another personal.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","","Got it okay and is the ANH cohort I mean is that you expect to continue to trend higher I mean is that relatively sustainable.","Paul J. Krump","","Yes, we've got to learn very good plans for A&H in the coming years, I had mentioned before that we\u2019ve invested in the team of underwriters over the last five years, we've built-in some infrastructure around the globe and we\u2019re finding out that our reputation and our quality of our paper and the relationships are making a big difference in that market place and in fact, we\u2019re finding that there is just an awful lot of commercial accounts that we can round out with A&H covered and we\u2019re also seeing a lot of high net worth individuals that are looking to purchase travel accident as well.","","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","Great, thanks and then just one sort of bigger picture question I guess is just on this recent volatility that we\u2019ve seen I mean again I mean its part of the business and its part of the reason that you\u2019re able to sort of extract the premiums you do, but they are \u2013 I would their reinsurance solutions out there especially given sort of the state of that market on the property side at this time. Would you or how do you look into solutions that might help you reduced volatility of earnings and attritional losses outside of cats?","Richard G. Spiro","","It\u2019s Ricky. Obviously given the environment as you point out, you know we do constantly monitor the reinsurance alternatives available in the market, see whether it can not only improve our overall performance of our portfolio but also help us manage our volatility perhaps potentially grow all at the same time well trying to maintain or improve our combined ratios. We have and will continue to consider variety of options in both the traditional and alternative markets and as always we look at the cost of these alternatives versus the benefit of purchase and protection and where we routinely manage our overall portfolio and reinsurance strategy by reviewing various types of risk transfer options. We\u2019re not going to change our outstanding strategy focusing on proper underwriting and pricing of each risk.","Having said all that, we are looking at all kinds of alternatives. We understand that there are opportunities in the marketplace, but as you might expect there is always we try to balance the potential short-term opportunities with our long-term objective and strategy. So we\u2019re looking at things, but they've got to meet our particular objectives and our strategy.","John D. Finnegan","You know in the end we are an insurance company and we have to bear some risk and eliminating volatility is a big step from eliminating true balance sheet risk and given away a lot of profitability and so you look at the downside. This is the worst quarter we've had since here in terms of fire losses and this kind of things and its three points worst than a five year average and guess what? We still make $2 a share on net income. So you know I mean its \u2013 we are sorry we didn't hit what we expected to hit, but this awful quarter we make $2 a share I don\u2019t think we have to ensure it away.","Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good evening. Thanks for taking my call. As a first question you saw, do you see any sort of loss cost trend across your business and the question is really as you see the pricing increase gradually slowing down, I just wonder at what point the price increase is essentially matching the loss cost trend that was the no margin expansion or what potentially margin contraction?","John D. Finnegan","Well let\u2019s talk a little bit about it. I mean, let\u2019s take, we use we say often that we have 4% loss cost trends. And I don\u2019t think for looking at margin expansion is kind of a theoretical notion, but if you project combined ratios out, it gets important to understand what\u2019s really going on there. We\u2019re above that in CPI and CSI. We\u2019re right above that and CCI. But I\u2019m thinking kind of couple of things when you project out loss ratios, in the future. The first is that, we\u2019ll turn transfer are different than what we might expect for losses in given short-term period.","For example, when we talk about long run lost cost trends, we generally mean the economic forces our portfolio paces, before consideration of any underwriting initiatives, any business mix changes that we might adopt. So they assume a pass of underwriting approach. You know workers compensation it might be, or we\u2019re talking about as let\u2019s got to more the 4% with medical care, cost inflation and payroll inflation it doesn't take into account the types of things we might do in terms of changes in business mix, the client paper predict, but analytically we are using in claims and adjusting these things.","So we\u2019re constantly seeking to improve our books of business and where you just beyond rate taking focused under initiatives calling in the performing risk. It was successful in our book management, the effective year-over-year pressure on our lost ratio is overtime what generally been less in the long-term most trend itself so that\u2019s one. Two, as I mentioned before even when you project loss ratio, you got a pickup base period that\u2019s representative. Last year, as I said we talked about don\u2019t use the second quarter last year that\u2019s very, very low and we found at that wouldn\u2019t have a good quarter to use. But because the second quarter was low initiate second was high. ","Now going forward I would suggest as you look at what you called margin expansion a future loss cause, you also taking into account that this second quarter roughly high loss ratio and you know you probably need to assume some reversion to the mean as you project out into the future loss trend just not apply, the difference in margin expansion that help.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes, thank you with that. Just different topic on the buyback it looks like this first half you really terms some buybacks and dividends more than what you earned to operating earnings. If you fair to assume that you could have return 100% like operating earnings as through the entire 2014?","John D. Finnegan","Yes, our objective as we\u2019ve said in the past, on average is that the buyback in essence we equal to operating earnings, less shareholder dividends. If you actually did the math when we came into this year, we were going to get back a little bit more than that formula might suggest an even with the updated guidance \u2013 operating earnings will exceed that amount, operating earnings less dividends would be a little bit less than our share buyback efforts. So, it depends on the period but on average we would expect that we would use the operating earnings less dividends as sort of the guideline.","Richard G. Spiro","","It might recall last year the opposite\u2026","John D. Finnegan","","The opposite\u2026","Richard G. Spiro","","Were a couple of $100 million more in operating earnings, less dividends. And, we are not going to just the program of $100 million shorten income this year. Obviously give a big catastrophe all bets are off.","John D. Finnegan","","And we continue to believe that we have a significant excess capital position, so we have plenty of flexibility.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Thank you so much for all the answers.","Operator","","We will go next to Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","","Thank you. A couple of questions, first is on the surety business, obviously a big contributor to your profitability. I guess we're hearing some noise that, that business is getting more competitive, wants you to kind of discuss what you are seeing there. And then, secondly, the favorable development in the specialty business, presumably that's going to be from the professional lines business was with the highest we\u2019ve seen in something like six years or so. And I'm wondering if you can get into more detail what drove that pretty significant favorable reserve development in the quarter?","John D. Finnegan","","Okay, maybe a I can start just with the \u2013 on the surety fees I mean clearly is the competitive market, because really surety capacity it\u2019s increased over the last several years with demand is down obviously due to the slowdown in the construction in the U.S. as well as actually many geographies around the world.","So, it has put pressure on rates that we can and we obviously do compete successfully really because of our brand or underwriting acumen or pricing discipline and the quality of customers that we have and we have been able to do that very well, it tends to grow slowly to surety business and it\u2019s a little bit lumpy, but has been historically very profitable and we\u2019re going to continue steady as we go.","Richard G. Spiro","","Okay. And then, Jay, as relates to the question on development, let me try to give a few data points to answer that. First if you look at the development we took in CSI for this quarter which was $80 million, it was driven mainly as you rightly point out by professional liability, but surety was also favorable and within professional liability it was driven by D&O and fiduciary and it was partially offset but it's a small adverse development in the crime and fidelity classes.","If you go back and look at it compared to a year ago quarter where we also had more development this quarter than we did in the second quarter of 2013 that was mainly because a year ago we had more offsetting adverse development in crime and fidelity E&O and EPL reflecting some of that the trends that we've talked about on this call and on prior calls as well.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","That\u2019s helpful. And then on the D&O and Fiduciary what accident years are we talking about?","John D. Finnegan","","We are taking 2010 and prior.","","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","","Great. Thank you.","","Operator","","We\u2019ll go next to Meyer Shields, KBW.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc","","Thanks good afternoon. I was just hoping I could get the catastrophe numbers for the other segments besides homeowners?","Richard G. Spiro","","Can you just give me a second here?","John D. Finnegan","","You want to split between commercial and personal?","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc","","Well if I could it online that would be great, but I will take it if it\u2019s available.","Richard G. Spiro","Okay let see here. Okay, I got it right here by the line here. We got package at five multi parallel, yes and then we come down at Property and Marine 13.1, homeowners 12.1.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc","Okay. So nothing in auto?","Richard G. Spiro","Well auto and personal it was tiny, it was 0.6. All right that\u2019s enough.","Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc","Okay thanks very much.","Richard G. Spiro","Sure.","Operator","","We\u2019ll go next to Ian Gutterman from Balyasny.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","","Hi, thank you. I guess I wanted to follow-up on the fire losses, is there any other maybe the first spilt I take it, was this a large number of fires relative to normal or was it few and just a very high end homes and basically getting is it a frequency or severity issue?","John D. Finnegan","","Both.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Both okay. Any geographic or okay.","John D. Finnegan","No, I mean there were \u2013 to get these numbers, you got to have a large number and by our nature of the kind of business we have, they are large in dollars too, but it was a too major losses there was a lot of losses.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","And but the factor we are calling is not cat means they weren\u2019t say wildfire related or tornado related or anything like that?","Paul J. Krump","","You\u2019re absolutely correct Ian. We make a distinction between a brushfire that would get a PCS cat number say a wildfire that might take place out in California or something and burn up a neighborhood that may or may not, but if it got a cat number, we would put that in the cat numbers. These are just large individual homes that burnt to the ground that's the business we're in.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Got it and has there been any issue is as far as on the severity that rebuild cost is maybe higher than you think or insured values were too lower, anything that suggest aside from the frequency that there might be something you are taking up on the underwriting?","Paul J. Krump","","It\u2019s a great question and the answer is no, we've gone through those files with a fine-toothed comb. We\u2019re very proud of our appraisal process. Getting the insurance to values absolutely key for us its part of our underwriting DNA because we don\u2019t get that valuation right nothing else really matters, because the rates are promulgated off of that. So that\u2019s a big difference when we send people in that really understand high net worth homes all the special mill work and all the special features and fixtures to the homes, we have fine arts specials, jewelry specialist, you name it. So that's our bread and butter.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Perfect, perfect, that was my real concern. Rick, a question on the guidance, just to make sure I heard right. I think you said earlier that the implied second half is a point and half better combined ratios than the first half, but it looks like that the fire in the non-cat was a best three points impact on the first half. So that would imply the second half apples-to-apples as a point and a half worst in the first half. Am I doing that right?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes, the other piece that I didn\u2019t talk about redevelopment.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Got it, got it. So we\u2019re assuming a less development I guess in the second and the first?","Richard G. Spiro","We don\u2019t make any specific development assumption; we just run a whole bunch of different scenarios so make your type.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Got it, got it. And then my last one, the pickup in the new to loss ratio given that the retention picked up or is it more a function of less lost business and sort of stable new business or was it more new business and stable loss business, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of was it more in offensive or defensive driver I guess or both?","Richard G. Spiro","It was both, but it was mainly attributable to the higher retention ratio in both the CI and CSI.","Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Perfect. I think that\u2019s all I had. Thanks so much.","Operator","","And with no further questions in this queue.

This call is being recorded For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.","Thank you and welcome to our September 30, 2018, third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company's performance and growth, pricing and business mix, and economic and market conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially.","Please see our most recent SEC filings, earnings release, and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.","Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Good morning. As a global insurer we experienced an active quarter for natural catastrophes around the world, but hardly on the same scale as the industry's record-breaking CAT events from the prior-year quarter. As you saw from the numbers, Chubb reported core operating income of $2.41 per share; excluding CATs and prior reserve development, we earned $2.82 per share, which compares to $2.68 prior year on the same basis, up over 5%.","Overall, it was a good quarter for the company, highlighted by excellent underwriting results and strong investment income. Premium revenue growth was good in U.S. commercial P&C and particularly strong in our international P&C business, personal and commercial, as we benefited from a number of our growth initiatives. On the other hand, growth in our U.S. personal lines business was impacted by the onetime accounting action we described last quarter, which distorts the year-over-year comparison.","P&C underwriting income of $669 million benefited from contributions from current accident year results and positive prior-year reserve releases. Our published P&C combined ratio was 90.9% which included 6 points of CAT. On a current accident year basis, excluding CAT, the combined ratio was 88.2% versus 88.5% prior year; simply world-class. For your information, the current accident year combined ratio with an expected level of CATs was 92.8% versus 93% prior year.","Net investment income of $883 million was driven by strong positive cash flow and higher reinvestment rates, which are beginning to benefit from an improving interest rate environment. Book and tangible book value per share were up about 0.5% and 1.3%, respectively, and were unfavorably impacted by FX. Phil will have more to say about book value, investment income, CATs, and prior-period development.","Turning to growth and market conditions; for the company overall, Global P&C net premium revenue, which excludes agriculture, was 4% for the quarter in constant dollars. Foreign exchange had a negative impact on growth of about 0.5%. Excluding merger-related actions, growth was actually 4.5% in constant dollars. Merger-related actions are virtually behind us now.","Commercial P&C pricing for the business we wrote overall was similar to what we saw in the second quarter, and in fact better in many lines. As a general statement, pricing in the U.S. in particular was not keeping pace with loss cost trends in a number of important longer tail classes. All things being equal, this puts pressure on margins and serves as a natural governor on growth. For our company, this pressure is ameliorated to some degree in those lines by our ongoing underwriting portfolio actions and, overall, by our mix of business, i.e., we're emphasizing growth in other areas.","In North America, rates overall were up about 2.5%, down marginally from last quarter's 3%. The difference was almost entirely a result of mix of business. At the same time, retention of our customers remained strong across all of our North America Commercial and Personal P&C businesses, with the renewal retention as measured by premium, over 90%. Beginning with our major account retail and E&S wholesale division, premiums were up over 3.5%. Excluding merger-related underwriting actions, which are concentrated in this division, net premiums were up about 5.5%. Again, merger-related actions are now behind us with only about $20 million left for the fourth quarter.","For major accounts, our renewal retention, as measured by premium in the quarter, was 92.7%. And for the business we wrote in major, rates overall were up 2%. The rate of increase for several important long-tail lines was higher than prior quarter, including casualty, management liability, and risk management; while the rate of increase for property was lower than the last few quarters.","In our North America middle market and small commercial business, premiums overall were up over 3.5% in the quarter. Excluding financial lines, where growth was essentially flat due to underwriting actions, premiums were up nearly 5%. New business was up almost 14%, with a quarter of that coming from growth initiatives. Renewal retention in our middle market business was 90%. Middle market P&C rates, excluding comp, were up 2%, the strongest quarter again in several years and continuing a positive trend; while exposure growth added an additional 1%.","In our U.S. small commercial business, premium revenue continued to accelerate in the quarter, with net premiums up 30%. Over 3,700 Chubb agents are now actively using our small business platform and took advantage of our broadening appetite to submit over 34,000 opportunities to us in the quarter. Over time, this will become an important business.","In our North America personal lines business, net premiums were up 2% in the quarter. Growth was 2.7%, and in line with our expectations and the prior quarter's after adjusting for onetime accounting actions which we discussed on last quarter's call. Retention remains very strong at 96%. Of note, the personal lines loss ratio was up due to elevated loss cost both non-CAT weather and non-weather-related water and fire losses.","Pricing was up 2.7% in the quarter, the strongest rate increase quarter for homeowners in a number of years. We are taking and will continue to take underwriting and pricing actions which, over a reasonable period of time, will bring our loss ratio back in line.","In our North America agriculture business, yields for the crop year look very good based on what we know today. We cannot yet predict prices, but they appear to be in the range of deductibles. Our crop insurance business is a great franchise where we are the clear leaders. Crop insurance is a part of the agriculture economy and farmers need this coverage and buy it every year; the same as other businesses buy insurance. Our ability to select and underwrite risk, pay claims, and service customers year after year through our nationwide network of offices is simply unrivaled. We have 5,600 agents and 450 employees producing this business.","Turning to our Overseas General Insurance operations; as I mentioned at the opening, we experienced excellent growth this quarter in our international P&C business. Net premiums written for our international retail division were up over 8% in constant dollar. And FX then had a negative impact of 1.8 points. This compares favorably to growth of 6% last quarter and year-to-date growth of 5%. So we are experiencing good momentum.","Asia Pacific and Latin America contributed growth of 11.5% and 10%, respectively, while the Continent was up over 3.5%, and UK\/Ireland was up about 1.5%. Net premiums for our commercial P&C lines overall in international retail were up over 11% in the quarter; while premiums for middle market and small commercial, another growth initiative we have been discussing, grew 13% in the quarter, led by Asia and Latin America, the key focus regions for us where net premiums were up 19%.","Net premiums for our London market wholesale business were up about 6% in the quarter. International personal lines premiums were up over 7.5% in constant dollar driven by double-digit growth, again in both Latin America and Asia. As for pricing conditions outside the U.S., rates in our international retail and London wholesale business is varied by line and region, and by country within region. We have so many classes and so many territories. Overall rate increases were in line with last quarter, up 3% in our retail division, and up 4% in our wholesale business.","Our global A&H division in total had a reasonable quarter with premiums up 4.5% in constant dollar. In our international A&H business, premiums were up 4%, led by Asia Pacific with growth of 8.5%; while premiums in North America grew 6.5%. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade, and Ed Clancy can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends.","In summary, it was a good quarter for Chubb. Business activity is brisk. We have received over 1 million new business submissions year-to-date in the U.S., a record for our company, and up 12% over last year. Our people are optimistic and focused on serving their customers and distribution partners. The compelling nature of our franchise, our broad product lineup, our distinguished service reputation, our expansive distribution capabilities, and our geographic presence gives us great confidence in our future earning power and our ability to outperform.","As our industry-leading combined ratios clearly illustrate, we are trading some growth for underwriting profitability. At the same time, because of our global presence and the expanded capabilities of Chubb today, we have many areas of opportunity to take advantage of without sacrificing underwriting discipline from our unrivaled large account franchise to our small commercial and middle market businesses globally, our international personal lines, global A&H and Asia-based life insurance businesses, all of which are growing more rapidly and are not subject to current commercial P&C pricing conditions, varies by area.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil. And then, we'll be back to take your questions.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","Thank you, Evan. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong with total capital of $64 billion. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.7 billion. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $716 million to shareholders, including $337 million in dividends and $379 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date, through October 23rd, we have returned $1.8 billion to shareholders, including $1 billion in dividends and $760 million in repurchases. We also paid off $100 million of debt that matured in the quarter.","Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $883 million, compared to $893 million in last year's quarter. Last year included a one-off gain of $44 million. Given the rising interest rate environment and in anticipation of a steepening yield curve, we have shortened the duration of our fixed income portfolio from 4.2 to 3.9 years. This in effect helps immunize the portfolio against the mark-to-market impact from rising interest rates. In addition, as rates rise, we will reinvest the portfolio at a faster rate.","To that point, as you saw in the supplement, our portfolio's reinvestment rate has increased year-to-date from 2.9% at December 31st to 3.5% at September 30th. Our current book yield is 3.5% and, therefore, the increased yield will eliminate downward pressure on investment income.","To improve the efficiency of our global cash management, we maintain a cash pooling program. Our local legal entities around the world deposit excess cash into this pool or borrow cash from the pool to minimize our global cash balances and to avoid disturbing local investment portfolio. The cost of borrowing is included in interest expense, and the interest earned on deposits is included in investment income.","The use of this program will be reduced during the fourth quarter based on current needs, resulting in offsetting declines in both interest income and corresponding interest expense of approximately $10 million to $15 million. As a result, we now expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income run rate to be in the range of $875 million to $885 million, which reflects this reduction in interest.","We also have investment activity that's included in other income from our private equity funds where we own greater than 3%. These returns have some variability quarter to quarter. This quarter, other income included $21 million pre-tax related to these investments. We expect our run rate on these investments to be $10 million pre-tax, again, as part of other income.","So putting everything together, we should add to the investment income range the estimated $10 million in other income from private equity returns and $10 million in lower interest expense, for total income to the company from investment-related activities of $895 million to $905 million.","Turning to book value, in the quarter, book and tangible book value per share increased 0.4% and 1.3%, respectively. Both were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange losses of $425 million after-tax; $252 million of which impacted the tangible net assets. As a result of our shorter duration and the diversified nature of the portfolio, there was no significant change to book value this quarter for mark-to-market changes in the investment portfolio.","The mark-to-market on our fixed income portfolio was an unrealized loss of $135 million after-tax, offset by other realized gains of $154 million after-tax, principally related to the valuation of the underlying investments in our private equity funds.","For the year, rising interest rates have resulted in realized and unrealized losses of $1.3 billion after-tax. Excluding the mark on investments, book and tangible book value per share increased 3.3% and 6.9%, respectively, reflecting strong underlying results, strong net investment income and positive cash flow.","Our annualized core operating ROE in the quarter was 8.7%. As a reminder, Chubb records the change in the fair value mark on its private equity funds as realized gains. So, therefore, it is not included in core operating income. Other companies record the impact of the mark as part of their investment income.","This quarter, we had after-tax gains of $144 million, which would increase our core operating EPS by $0.31 per share and our annualized core operating ROE to 9.8%. For the year, after-tax gains of $269 million would increase our core operating EPS by $0.57 per share and our annualized core operating ROE to 9.8%, compared to the reported ROE of 9.1%.","Net catastrophe losses for quarter were $450 million pre-tax or $372 million after-tax as previously announced and as are further detailed in the financial supplement. We had positive prior-period development in the quarter of $243 million pre-tax. This included $65 million of net adverse development related to the homeowners' lines where losses trended higher than expected; and $54 million of adverse development related to our legacy environmental exposure. The remaining favorable development of $362 million comprises 85% long-tail lines, principally from accident years prior to 2014 and 15% short-tail lines.","Net loss reserves increased $269 million in the quarter, adjusting for foreign exchange. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 93% in the quarter. Adjusting for PPD and CAT losses, the ratio was 86%. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.1%. As we continued to evaluate the impact of U.S. tax reform, the final amount of the provisional tax benefit recognized may increase or decrease, as new regulations are set to be issued in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in a range of 13% to 15%.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Helen.","Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.","Thank you. At this point we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. My first question; Evan, I appreciate all the comments on the pricing view. As we're now in the fourth quarter, starting to annualize when we saw some of the rate increases last year, seems like a pretty stable environment in the third quarter. Do you think the industry \u2013 I know overall there's a lot of business lines will be able to continue to push for a stable level of rate as we annualize the losses that we saw last year. And when you're giving the pricing color, another commercial lines insurer did point to potentially looking to higher interest rates as a reason to maybe push for less price. Could you just comment if you're seeing a reliance on interest rates in the pricing decisions of other companies in the market?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Well, Elyse, I can't look into the minds of others, so I'm not sure what they're thinking. But when I'm looking at the fourth quarter right now, I'm not seeing any change really in pricing momentum. The one variable you always have in the fourth quarter is, people who really want to puff up their chest about how they grew. They chase volume always \u2013 and this is just the way it works \u2013 in the fourth quarter to try to meet budgets and all that stuff.","And so you always see some more desperate noise around getting business in the fourth quarter that you don't see the same way in other quarters. Interesting. But I've seen no change to that pattern. But with that said, we see the same pattern of rate movement so far in the fourth quarter that we saw in the third, with more casualty-related lines getting rate, with the exception of Middle Market comp, and property because you're now rate-on-rate slowing down. And that's kind of the pattern, as we've been seeing it.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of the homeowners business, you alluded to taking more price and looking to improve the margins there. So, is it that you guys expect the level, I guess, of non-CAT losses, the fire and water that we saw in quarter, kind of taking price for that and that might continue, and was that also a driver of the adverse development? Could we just get a little bit more color on what's going on within the homeowners' book?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Sure. Yeah. I'm going to turn it over to Paul Krump, but I'm going to make this one general statement and it will be redundant a little bit to what he says. But we've been \u2013 this is a trend we've been talking about for a while. And it's a trend; it's not simply a one off, one quarter or one or two quarters. We've been seeing this movement in loss ratio and talking about it for two years now.","And with that, let me turn it over to Paul.","Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.","Thanks, Evan. Thanks, Elyse. I kind of anticipated the question. So I've got a little bit of a fulsome answer here. So the current accident year ex-CAT ratio, loss ratio for PRS is up 5.7 points in Q3 2018 versus last year's Q3. So, as Evan mentioned, the deterioration is driven more by larger water and non-CAT weather and fire losses in the homeowners' line. We've experienced an increased frequency and severity throughout the year which, frankly, as you noted, has been seeping in for last two years.","We don't think we're alone in the industry here, Elyse, in experiencing this elevated loss activity, and we're not dismissing it as simple, normal volatility. Recognize we have a portfolio of homeowners and the amount of rate needed to achieve adequacy varies by region and cohort from no rate increase required to something more substantial.","We're already surgically addressing this issue by zip code, age of home, construction, size of property, supporting ancillary lines of business and the type of dwelling our insured owns. Variations matter between home, say, versus condo or co-op. And, of course, we're doing this within the confines of a very highly-regulated business.","Along with already taking more rate where needed, we're addressing the issue with underwriting actions including predicting and preventing losses. We don't believe that simply passing on rate increases will win the day. That said, I've been involved in overseeing this book for a good portion of the last 15 years, so allow me to add my perspective, as I hear way too much misinformation about the high net-worth market and PRS in particular.","First, for us, this is a homeowners issue and while homeowners is half our book of PRS business, it is not the entire PRS portfolio; the other lines are performing well. Second, we're seasoned insurance professionals and have served the high net-worth category for over 30 years. Over those years, environmental and societal changes have caused spikes or elevation in the homeowners' loss ratio from time to time, and we have addressed them while growing our book.","This is our business; we're very proud to serve our customers and our world-class claims service is the bedrock of our customer value proposition. As an example, J.D. Power recently recognized this exceptional service by ranking us one of only two carriers to earn their prestigious five Power Circles rating for property claims satisfaction.","We will continue to enhance our reputation and improve our loss ratio while growing the PRS book. Growth will continue to skew towards those clients who appreciate our broad coverages and first-class services. This past quarter, our new PRS business volume was up 7% over Q3 2017. Make no mistake, we're not resting on our laurels, and we will continue to blaze new trails and invest more than anyone in the high net-worth business.","Four quick examples. One, on the product front, we have recently launched coverage for customers with in-home businesses, cyber coverage, farm and ranch coverage for our clients with a penchant for the outdoors, global coverages, and enhanced travel accident coverages. We are also working on what I'll call slim down offerings for those prospects who desire a little less coverage and service in exchange for a premium savings.","Two, on the digital front, we're working to enable the full client experience to be done digitally. Specifically within our customer portal, we have recently added ePolicy, eBilling, eSignature, personalized risk inspection reports, loss mitigation enrollment, as well as mobile apps for items like Auto ID Cards and another to monitor and promote safer drivers. We just added biometric login to make the process even easier, and we are just getting started. We will continue to expand our digital capabilities.","Three, on the predict and prevent front, we are using the thermographic scanners, water detection shut-off valves, arborists, art experts, our in-house risk engineers and, of course, our well-known Wildfire Defense Services to assist our clients and mitigate losses, all while making ourselves more relevant to our customers, independent agents and brokers, and furnishing the Chubb brand.","Fourth, in speaking of our producers, we are supporting them on the sales front by arming them with hundreds of warm leads and aiding them in writing in specific ZIP codes where profitable new business resides. In summary, the past few years of wildfires, floods, hurricanes, hail storms, tornadoes, mudslides, and water damage have intensified losses and made many agents and their clients take serious notice of who is insuring them. This backdrop is causing our homeowners line to experience margin compression, but longer term, this spells opportunity for Chubb as well as our agents and brokers.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","More than you ever wanted to know, Elyse.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes, that was very helpful. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Thank you. Evan, I guess my first question is when you talked about U.S. commercial lines pricing, you said, yeah, things are kind of in line, maybe a little better in casualty than last quarter; but pricing is still below loss trend. I'm just curious, where do we need to get to in order to see margin stability here, and do you think we can get there?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. Look, it varies by line of business, so you really \u2013 you can't sort of make a general statement. And this is what I mean: there were some lines \u2013 in E&S casualty as an example, and I'm going to turn it over to our Chief Actuary in a second, to give you more color, but I want to give you a certain perspective.","You can listen to commentary that says rate right now equals loss cost trend. So there's no erosion in combined ratio. Well, you could be listening to that about certain E&S casualty lines that happen to be running 110% or 120% combined ratio. Now, there's a head fake around that statement. Right? When you hear it. There are other lines of business where, frankly, we're getting 1% in those casualty lines, and it is adequate because we're earning a reasonable underwriting profit there and we don't see a lot of loss cost trend.","So, it really varies around the lot. But to give you a more general picture of all this, let me turn it over to Paul O'Connell.","Paul O\u2019Connell - Chubb Ltd.","Thank you, Evan. Brian, the issue on loss cost trend, first of all, our loss cost trend impacts, obviously, our reserve base as well as our current accident year loss ratios. If we start with the loss reserve base, I'm confident that our current reserves are adequate. As Evan pointed out, we have many different products, classes, and territories so that trends do vary. But if we focus a high level look on long-tail lines, we are seeing a continuation of the broadly-favorable trends in the prior accident year development.","There are a few exceptions in select product lines, particularly those where we observed elevated frequency in the last few years. On our more recent accident years, or recent year loss ratios, the trend is putting pressure on margins in our casualty business. And again as Evan pointed out, the combination of rate and exposure isn't keeping pace with loss cost trend in many product lines, so all else equal there is potential for compression in our margins.","Despite the margin compression though, all our lines are producing an underwriting profit. And the compression in margin is also less than what the pure rate and trend math would suggest, since one has to consider the impact of underwriting actions, particularly our portfolio management process, as well as how the favorable prior-year trends are flowing through our current year projections.","Some high-level views on the U.S. operations for some of the casualty lines are as follows: so for workers' comp, rate has been flat to declining, our loss cost trends are exceeding exposure change, however, the continued favorable development on the prior accident year has tempered the compression that we're seeing on a year-over-year basis, that one would expect given the rate activity.","On the liability lines, again, a very broad mix of coverages and attachment points, we are seeing neutral to negative impact as loss cost trend is close to or exceeds current rate changes. So there has been some recent activity in rate that does show some promise. And then, there are also pockets of our portfolio where we are experiencing rate and exposure in excess of loss trend. In other areas, margin compression is tempered by favorable development and underwriting actions as well.","And then finally, on financial lines, again, also a very broad mix of products, so recent issues have been concentrated in select D&O product lines and classes; and there, loss trend is running higher than rate. So the majority of the portfolio, putting aside certainly the select D&O classes, is generating an underwriting profit and trends in rate have improved. Loss cost trends, while elevated, appear to have plateaued in these challenging classes.","John Keogh was going to provide a little bit more color about the financial lines.","John W. Keogh - Chubb Ltd.","Sure. As Paul noted, we've been observing in many classes our D&O business where rates simply aren't keeping pace with loss cost trends. And I guess we're now doing surprise interviews and we're finding more and more instances where our underwriters are not finding instances where rates are adequate to the exposure that we're looking at. So this has led to, as a result, shrinking our business. And, in my view, I think it's a pretty good example of good underwriting, and that is trading growth for adequate pricing.","So, in fact, if you look at our North American (sic) [America] Commercial P&C business year-to-date, that business has grown 3.6%. However, within that business is our substantial financial lines business. That business has actually shrunk 3.5% year-to-date. So if you look at North America Commercial P&C without the financial lines business, we're actually up a 5.5%. So, again, an instance where we are trading because of inadequate rates to loss cost trends in that business.","As respect to the actual loss cost trends in D&O, we've been talking about this for a better part of the year, and here we're seeing an increased frequency really starting in 2016 of suits against boards and directors. If you look at security class actions, they're running roughly in the last two years double historical averages. And there's a lot of drivers behind that, but the three that I would note that are the biggest drivers that we observe, one would be merger objection cases. This is where in a majority of merger transactions, there's a suit against the board, whether you're a seller or a buyer. It leads to a D&O suit. We've seen that drop a little bit in frequency as Delaware courts have taken a bit of a tougher stance against these claims, but it's definitely a problem.","Emerging plaintiff bars. There's firms out there that didn't exist 10 years ago that are finding this is a great opportunity to make money. And so, here, we're seeing innovation. I'll call it creative series of liability in terms of suits being against the boards and the management teams.","And then, lastly, a driver that we're observing, I'll call event-driven litigation against boards. So imagine the traditional general liability and property claims. Think of mass tort, a dam bursting and people being hurt, a cyber breach where you get property claims, you get liability claims. Well, guess what, more often than not today, you also get allegations and claims being brought against management and boards of directors. So there's the loss cost trends that we observe.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Wow. Very thorough. And just can I have a follow-up here. Talk a little bit about the agricultural crop business here. I know you said that we'll see how pricing comes out as far as how the profitability of that gets (00:37:22) for the year, because yields look like they're pretty good. I guess maybe just talk about the business more from a strategic perspective, how it fits within the whole Chubb franchise. And then, if I look at the profitability of that business, it's been quite attractive the last couple years. Do you think you're earning excess profits in that business right now or is that kind of where the margin's profitability should be?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","I'm going to turn it over in one second to John Lupica, but I'm going to take the last part of that question for a moment. He's going to talk to you about average combined ratios for the last decade. And there's, of course, a range of deviation around that like any line of business, but particularly a line of business that has a catastrophe element to it. And I think that's the way you have to think about it. I don't think there's this question of excess versus inadequate. I would disabuse of that, but let me turn it over to John.","John Joseph Lupica - Chubb Ltd.","Thanks, Brian, for the question. Chubb, via our legacy companies, we've been involved in the crop business for well over 30 years now. And as you know, we purchased 100% of the rain and hail franchise in December of 2010. And the franchise has been and continues to be the leading writer and brand in the crop insurance space. Rain and hail is part of the ag community with our 10 regional offices housing our 450-plus ag-only employees around the country.","Our multi-peril crop insurance policies are a vital part of the chain of commerce for farmers. As a tried and true revenue protection product, our farmers are able to use these policies as collateral when they're financing machinery, seed and fertilizer for the season. The financial security of the revenue product is just one critical reason for the purchase. Based on market data that we have, 86% of all eligible acres in North America utilize crop insurance due to its proven worth.","Again, rain and hail is the leading rider, with 20% of the crop market. We insure over 125,000 farmers farming 65 million net acres and growing 125 different crops. And our 10-year combined ratio has been an industry-leading 88%. We believe we can outperform the average due to a number of key differentiators in a business that really has, as you know, fixed-base pricing. And that's our brand and longevity in the market. Our service component and technology where we delivered to the agent to help process the business, and in claims where the efficient handling and quick payment of the claims are really critical.","We have a national footprint that gives us the scale and spread of risk. We have 2,600 agencies represented by 5,600 agents that are appointed and we train every year on the marketplace. We talked about 10 regional leaders who are the best in the business. On the data side, we have modeling capabilities on over 2.1 million farm fields that we have decades of data; and our leadership, who spent their careers in this business. All of this has led rain and hail to outperform the market.","So in a simple answer, yeah, we understand the crop business. We get the CAT-like volatility it brings and we manage to that. And we absolutely believe it's a core contributor to the Chubb organization. So hope that helps.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Thank you, and good morning. You gave a very comprehensive answer to Elyse's question on personal line, but I do have a follow-up. Evan, you mentioned you want to get the core loss ratio back in line, and do you mean that you're going back to the 51% levels back in two years ago and how long will it take you to get there?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, I'm not giving you a point estimate, but you're in the range. And it will take \u2013 look, it will take a little while. It could take 18 months or thereabouts, because you got \u2013 this is a filed product, you got to keep filing rate increases. You put them in on renewal. It takes time to earn in. And then in the meantime, we are taking other underwriting action regarding coverage, how we offer coverage, who we offer it to, where we offer it \u2013 we're refining some of that right now, based on what we know \u2013 and our use of reinsurance. So, all of that will play, Kai.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. The other question I have is on the Chubb's EPS growth potential. If you look at top line premium growth, underlying had been sort of mid-single digit, 4% to 5%; and your margin is excellent, so probably \u2013 which also means probably less room for further improvement there. And then on net investment income, you've been growing mid-single digit as well. So, your earnings is growing mid-single digits. If you add on top of that you're buying back $1 billion, that's about a 1% to 2% of the shares, so EPS is going to grow like mid-single digits; is that right way to think about your growth potential? And other driver could accelerate that growth?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Well, your math is pretty good. The thing I'd add to that is, I think with a combination of our own underwriting discipline and the freedom that we have to grow in other areas when there are certain areas under stress because of our geographic and product reach and the customer segments and distribution. The freedom that gives us. When I add that and I add an interest rate environment that, frankly, is improving from our perspective and what I think is a yield curve that's going to steepen, I might, over a reasonable period of time, play a little more about the earning power that will come out of the investment side.","That's as far as I'm going to go, Kai, because I don't engage in \u2013 I don't give guidance and this is a guidance discussion. And so, I'm being friendly and patient.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. I guess just one quick comment related to Kai's question, the other leverage you may have is \u2013 you have acknowledged you have excess capital so at some point deploying that capital one way or another could add to growth, I would think. But my question is...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","That's very true, Jay, but it's opportunistic. And I can't predict.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, absolutely.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","The only thing I'll tell you is is, you go into a difficult environment, the more difficult the environment gets, I'm thinking from a macroeconomic or financial or political, that's when opportunities rear their heads.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","We've seen that historically. So, my question was on Overseas General. There was a \u2013 you look at this year, there's just been a notable acceleration in the premium growth, and you talked about some of the drivers. I'm wondering if you can drill down a little bit more and talk about what you think going forward will be the key areas of growth for that business.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yes. I'm going to do that. But what I'm going to do first is hand it to Juan Andrade, who runs that business, and let him speak a little about it. And then we'll come back and have a short chat.","Juan C. Andrade - Chubb Ltd.","Great. Thanks, Jay. As Evan said in his opening comments, our international business is continuing to grow very well in the third quarter and the growth was driven by international retail operations which grew over 8% in constant dollars. London wholesale operations also grew close to 6%. We're seeing the growth accelerate as we continue to implement our strategies and leverage the power of today's Chubb through our expanded distribution, our product capabilities, and our customer segmentation. Our diversified platform in terms of geography, our branches within that geography, our product, our distribution, continues to be a competitive advantage and a key growth driver for us.","We saw growth across all of our major lines of business, with commercial P&C leading the growth at 11% in constant dollars. As Evan mentioned, our small commercial and middle market businesses grew 13% with Asia and Latin America contributing with growth of 19%. Personal lines also had very good growth. The investments we have made in technology, product, customer segmentation, and traditional bancassurance and digital distribution are paying off.","Our strongest growth continues to come from the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America as a result of our focus on customer segmentation, our consumer lines, and our expanded agency, bancassurance, and growing digital capabilities. In the quarter, Asia grew over 11%, and Latin America 10% in constant dollars. This is consistent with the double-digit growth we experienced last quarter.","Our focus on the emerging middle class with targeted product offerings through a multi-channel distribution approach, along with our focus on small commercial, mid-size companies, and offering them a wide product range from technologically advanced front-end systems and accessing them through a wide distribution platform, enabled by our significant branch impressions, has been the backbone of our growth.","Australia and Mexico are two examples of these regions of countries that continue to produce excellent results given the product and technology capabilities we have built and deployed and the distribution relationships that we have expanded. We have a well-diversified product and distribution platform, geographic reach, and outstanding management teams.","In addition, our underwriting discipline has also paid off, as we have been able to react fast to changing market conditions, while competitors focus on their internal profitability issues. In addition to Asia and Latin America, we also saw meaningful growth contributions from developed markets of Japan and Europe.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very helpful. Thank you, Juan.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome, Jay. Will we it will continue? Well, you see momentum building.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just for Evan, your comment was that you're confident you'll be able to continue to outperform. In your view, does outperform \u2013 and I'm assuming that's other competitors in the industry, do you think margin stability over the next, I don't know, X amount of years, X amount of quarters, is going be enough to outperform, or do you think you need margins to expand?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Or need what, need the margins to expand? Is that what was the question?","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Yeah. Yeah. So in other words, when you think about what will make Chubb outperform fundamentally...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","When I think about our performance, I think \u2013 when I look at the combined ratios of this company, and I look at the size and scale of this organization, and I look at the breadth of it, geographically, and the customers we serve, and what we do, and you add all of that relevance together to add \u2013 to take the size of what this company is, and what we are producing as earnings, and the combined ratio because it's an underwriting company in the risk business, I think the company outperforms. I think it is outperforming.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Got it. And just wanted to maybe hear you opine a little bit on catastrophes. I think year-to-date we're already through I think the level that you thought was a normalized CAT load. And it doesn't seem like numerically there's been a normal CAT year, but I know that things have been kind of tricky. So, how should we \u2013 how are you thinking about this year from a CAT standpoint, and why are there more than $1 billion of CATs just three quarters in?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. I think it's an elevated CAT year, for sure. I think the math speaks. You can't be \u2013 Ryan, it's a global question and a global answer. It's not a U.S.-centric question. Though I think people tend to focus on \u2013 in the U.S., on just seeing America and American-related when \u2013 just look at the globe, there's a much bigger world out there. And on a global basis, CATs are elevated. This year is elevated.","And is it a new normal? There's deviation around the mean. You just look at it over the last bunch of years. It's obviously better than last year, but it is an elevated year. And you look at the CAT losses in Asia, you look at some in Europe, you look at what there's been in the U.S. between from wildfires to water and everything in between, and you look at the fourth quarter of that; this is not an average year if you define average as the mean or the median over the last 10 or 15 or 20 years.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Fair enough. Any indication on how to think about, I guess, the Michael loss and how that might fit within the 4Q budget?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Look, it's early days, and we don't have a good handle on this yet. Our very early indication would say $150 million to $250 million pre-tax net. But you know what; I don't know if it's going be higher than that or lower than that.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Thanks for your answers.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse Group AG","Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up for Phil on taxes first. There's been a few \u2013 at least a few multi-national financial firms that have signaled that this \u2013 it's called the base erosion tax, the BEAT is the acronym, it kicks in 2020, could cause the tax rate to creep up in the coming years. But there's still kind of uncertainty which I think you also mentioned as to guidance from the tax authorities. So I know Phil you said 13% to 15% is the right range, but were you speaking to 2018, and more information is needed to determine longer-term?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","That's exactly right. So certainly the BEAT kicked in this year and it's affecting our tax rate this year and it's reflected in our 13% to 15%. But as I said, there's going to be new guidance that's issued around Thanksgiving that will clarify the BEAT provision, and \u2013 among other things, and once we get to see that we'll have a better estimate for 2019.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse Group AG","Okay, great. And, Evan, kind of wanted to talk about \u2013 you've been one of the leading insurers investing and talking about the need to adapt to the digital age. Some of your peers seem to also be increasingly talking about it as well. I don't typically think of CapEx being material for P&C insurers, but I'm curious if it is material these days. And I guess, similarly, some insurers have kind of made technology-oriented acquisitions that maybe could be put in that digital CapEx bucket as well.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","What are you asking me? What's the question?","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse Group AG","So just curious if Chubb's CapEx levels are material. We don't typically talk about that, but it seems like there's more and more investments being made in technology-oriented processes and investments. I know you guys have been doing it for years now as well. So just curious if that could...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. And I have tried to be clear about it. I haven't given a number relative to the increase and I'm not doing that. But our CapEx \u2013 our investment, both CapEx and non-CapEx-related, because some of it comes directly just through expense and activities that you wouldn't classify as CapEx. So CapEx and that expense related to digital has increased over the last number of years. We have been clear. We spend about $1 billion a year on technology.","A good portion of that is CapEx related and capitalized. That would go towards technology related to software, to infrastructure, to communications, et cetera, and to improve your abilities or your insights from customer experience to data analytics and everything in between that. And of the $1 billion, roughly 40% of it is towards development that we classify as digital. And that kind of gives you a sense.","Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse Group AG","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, everybody. I guess my first question goes back to the small commercial space. You posted two consecutive quarters of very, very strong growth. And I hate to nitpick here, but, Evan, I think last quarter you talked about getting this portfolio up to a multi-billion-dollar level within three to five years. So I think even with this growth level, you still would need more. So are you expecting more acceleration of your organic growth or would this require \u2013 getting to your target, would that require some inorganic opportunities as well?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Well, first of all, I don't know how you did your math. Because I gave you a U.S. number, but I didn't give you a basic premium; and gave you an international number where you even have basic premium. And last quarter, we talked about the U.S. alone being at an annualized run rate of $400 million. So I'm going stop right there. I think I've answered the question.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. So maybe I misunderstood, because I do remember the $400 million number in the US alone. I thought that multi-billion dollar target was for the U.S. alone. So if I misunderstood, I apologize.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","No, I think it's global.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I see.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","And in any event there, you...","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","And I didn't break it down, because I just don't give guidance that way. I didn't break it down \u2013 and fair enough, I didn't break it down how much of that would be U.S. and not. But I did leave it vague as to \u2013 I gave a range around it and left it vague because I'm really trying to express the intent, the kind of size of opportunity and our confidence in executing it. That's really the point, rather than to allow you to make a point estimate.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","I'm not trying to express it and deliver it in a way that makes it sort of work sheet-related.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay, but at least it clarifies my confusion.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And my second question was around the annual A&E reserve update. I guess I was a little surprised to see as low as $12 million of strengthening this quarter. Can you maybe talk about that?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","There were two moving parts in that. One was, we did take a charge from environmental. On the other hand, we had a greater recognition because it just factually came through of recoverables against third parties that helped to offset.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, that's right. So we had $54 million charge as I've said in my commentary on environmental. And then as Evan says, we had the benefit of an increase in our estimate of reinsurance recoverables relating to long outstanding legacy liabilities.","Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. Thank you very much.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I was hoping to get your perspective on the Lloyd's marketplace based on the new leadership there, and that market's focused on improving its underwriting profitability. What do you envision there, and what are the implications for Chubb? Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","I know John Neil. I think he's a good man. And I wish him \u2013 and he's a good \u2013 I think he's a good executive, and I wish him all the best in his role. And on the other hand, it's the chief executive of a marketplace and the governance over a marketplace. The syndicates make their individual decisions regarding underwriting. And there's only so much that the Lloyd's Corporation can do about that, though it has important strategic handles that can pull in the future.","The Lloyd's marketplace is important to the industry, but it has longer-term structural issues in my mind that it ultimately has to address. It's a business model where the business seeks the market and comes to the market. That was a model that worked very well before a globalized world and before a digitized world. But I think the world has changed, and I think that the model to survive and remain as robust has got to adapt.","Its cost structure is way too high, and the way you access the market is \u2013 and underwriters are way too inefficient. Those are the bigger strategic questions. And over time, given the way the world has adapted, there is an element of antiselection that starts creeping into what comes to that marketplace if you fail to adapt. That's my reflection on that, and I'll stop right there.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks very much.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome.","Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.","Thank you. We have time for just one more person to ask question, please.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Meyer Shields from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Just a very brief question. We saw administrative expenses in corporate come down significantly on the year-over-year basis. I was wondering whether there's anything unusual in that.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","No, there's nothing unusual. We did have some integration-related savings but there's nothing material \u2013 no material change in that.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Meyer, there's some variability quarter to quarter in that line, based on one-off items and that sort of thing.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome.","Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.","Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention this morning.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.","Helen Wilson - Chubb Limited","Thank you and welcome to our September 30, 2016 third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company and investment portfolio performance, pricing and business mix, economic and insurance market conditions and integration of acquisitions including our acquisition of the Chubb Corporation, and potential synergies, savings and commercial and investment benefits we may realize. All of these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially.","Please refer to our most recent SEC filings, as well as our earnings press release and financial supplements which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.","During today's report, our management will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in our third quarter 2016 earnings press release and financial supplement.","Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Good morning. Chubb had an excellent quarter with record operating earnings per share, excellent core underwriting results and premium revenue growth in line with our expectations. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion were $2.88 per share compared to $2.74 per share prior year, again demonstrating in my judgment the accretive nature of our merger.","As I have done in the last two quarters when discussing our underwriting results and premium growth and to give you greater visibility to the health of the company, I will compare our results to the 2015 prior quarter as if we were one company back then and exclude the effects of purchase accounting, again this is how, as a manager, I look at the company's performance.","The P&C combined ratio for the quarter was a published 86% and excluding purchase accounting 85.5%. That compares to an 85% last year as if we were one company back then. There are three components to that. Catastrophe losses were up over prior year to $144 million pre-tax versus an exceptionally low $101 million last year.","Second, positive prior period reserve development of $349 million pre-tax was down $40 million versus prior year. So that leads to the P&C current accident year combined ratio excluding cat losses of 88.4% versus 88.9% last year benefiting in particular from a reduced expense ratio. Both our North American and international insurance operations had excellent calendar and current accident year results.","Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $830 million, a very good result, particularly given the record low interest rate environment. Investment income was at the top of the guidance we gave you. We have made good progress repositioning our portfolio in ways we have discussed on past calls. And this has in fact contributed to the quarter's results.","Tim Boroughs, our Chief Investment Officer, is prepared to make a few comments on the portfolio. If you like, just ask him.","Book and tangible book value per share were up 2.4% and 5.5% respectively. And our annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 12%, a really good result. Phil will have more to say about tangible book prior period reserve development and cat.","Turning to premium revenue, total P&C net premiums in the quarter were on a constant dollar basis declined 3.5%. Foreign exchange had a one point impact. As I have discussed on our previous calls, when we were planning the merger, we contemplated underwriting actions in certain portfolios not meeting our standards or exceeding our risk appetite. These actions which include either canceling or re-insuring certain business reduce our premium, but improve our risk reward profile. The impact from these actions will continue for the balance of this year and 2017 though at a reduced level and will dissipate as the year goes along.","If we normalize for these underwriting actions including the purchase of additional reinsurance, total P&C net premiums in the quarter grew over just 1% in constant dollars, a 4.5 point difference. The additional reinsurance accounts for 3.6 point of that 4.5 point difference with business cancellations representing the balance.","Keep in mind, the additional reinsurance had an outsized impact this quarter because of the one-time unearned premium transfer in personal lines.","I want to say a few words about current commercial P&C insurance market conditions globally. Pricing environment continue to grow more competitive in the quarter for our commercial P&C business and varied depending on the territory, line of business, and size of risk.","As noted in prior quarters, large account business particularly shared and layered is more competitive than midsize. And wholesale is more competitive than retail. Certain markets are noticeably more competitive than others. London, Bermuda, Australia, and Brazil, by example, were particularly competitive while the U.S. and Continental Europe competition is a little less ferocious and a bit more orderly but continuing to soften nonetheless.","Globally, new business is harder to come by. It is a hungry market and competition is fierce for new business; both rate and increasingly terms and conditions, particularly when it comes to large account business. Retention of renewals is a high priority. Our renewal retentions are excellent and I will give you some details shortly.","Rate movement varied by territory and market segment, but in general, fluctuated in a reasonably tight range. For example, renewal pricing for the business we wrote ranged from flat in our U.S. middle market business to down 2% in our U.S. major accounts business to down 3% and our international retail commercial P&C operations.","Globally, general and specialty casualty related pricing ranged from down or 0.5% to down 2.5%. Financial lines pricing range from flat to down 3% and property related pricing range from down 1% to down 5%.","Now, with all of that as context, let me give you some detail on our revenue results. In our North America commercial P&C business, net premiums were down about 2.5%. Normalizing for the impact of the additional reinsurance we purchased and for the underwriting actions, net premiums were flat. The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was quite good at just over 90%. And new business writings were up about 1.5%.","In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were down about 16%. The additional reinsurance we purchased had a 16.5 point impact, and the Fireman's Fund had a 3 point impact. Therefore, growth was over 3% for the combined Chubb and ACE portfolios.","Overall, North America personal lines rates were up 1.5% and exposure change added about 3%. Retention remained quite strong for the legacy Chubb and legacy ACE portfolios at 94% and 95% respectively.","The legacy Fireman's Fund portfolio as we continue to convert the business to Chubb paper, retention was 75%. The impact of the Fireman's Fund conversion is diminishing and will be virtually gone by first quarter. Net premiums for our agriculture business were up over 15% in the quarter. While still early, from what we can see today, based on yield forecasts and commodity prices, this is shaping up to be a very good year for crop insurance results.","Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were down in the quarter 1% in constant dollar, and up about 1.5% when normalized with the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions. While in our London market based E&S and surplus lines business, premiums were down 4%, were flat when normalized for underwriting actions.","The renewal retention rate for our international commercial P&C business was 84% in the quarter, actually right in line with historic averages, and new business writings were down 2%. International by line of business commercial P&C net premiums declined 3% but were flat excluding the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions, while personal lines grew 3% on the same basis.","Our global A&H business, net premiums written in constant dollars were flat in the quarter and up 1% adjusted for the underwriting-related portfolio actions. We expect improved growth in our A&H business in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, our combined insurance operations in North America grew 4% in the quarter.","Again, in sum, total company P&C net premiums in the quarter on a normalized basis grew just over 1% in constant dollar. While market conditions globally are competitive, I expect as we progress through future quarters and the impact of the merger continues to fade, given the compelling power and capabilities of the new Chubb, we will produce faster growth in the near future. In particular, we are building on the tremendous potential of our middle market businesses both domestic and international with both traditional core package and specialty product. We also have greater growth potential in our A&H and personal lines business.","To the large account and upper middle markets, the power of one Chubb is compelling, as we combine product and expertise to bring total solutions to clients. It is a real differentiator and will provide more opportunity in spite of soft market conditions.","We are already seeing evidence of this potential growth. We estimate that our efforts to promote new areas of coverage to midmarket and large account producers and account cross-selling in all of our businesses around the globe contributed about $88 million to our company's new business growth in the quarter, or 16% of North America's new business and 5% of international's new business.","We are also on the front foot with new products in digital distribution. For example, we recently began to introduce our small commercial business owner's package policy, the so-called BOP, during the quarter. What began as a small pilot with 12 agents in one state, has now been rolled out methodically to several hundred agents and we were approved to write business in 43 states. We are executing a disciplined plan and currently have capabilities to write some 500 industry classes of business. We have proven and deep expertise.","Our package includes broad coverage for property and liability exposures and is complemented by workers' comp, commercial auto, and financial lines products. Technology and data are a differentiator for us. Our business package can be quoted and issued by an agent online in as little as four minutes with minimal questions. We expect 80% of our packaged plans won't require underwriter intervention with an eventual goal to be 90% plus.","We also recently launched a cyber risk product specifically designed for micro-businesses via digital distribution through CoverHound as part of their new commercial insurance solutions for micro-size small businesses. We will soon add to that a miscellaneous professional liability product and a business owner's P&C package all featuring strength through processing from quote to issue. A number of Chubb's existing micro-insurance products are scheduled to be redesigned for digital distribution on the CoverHound platform and other web-based producers in the near future. Just stay tuned.","John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter including current market conditions and pricing trends as well as examples of how our expanded capabilities are benefiting the company.","Before I close, we are in good shape with our integration plans and activities. We are ahead of schedule in terms of both realized and annualized savings as you can see from the updated table in the press release. And in fact, we have now increased the total annualized run rate savings we will achieve by the end of 2018 to $800 million, up from $750 million.","Finally, our outstanding claims and risk engineering organization is performing at an especially high level as tested recently with a number of cats including Hurricane Matthew in the U.S. Let's remember, outstanding claims service is what this organization is all about.","Speaking of Hurricane Matthew, while early days and from everything we know, we project our cat losses from this event to be circa $200 million pre-tax.","With that, I will turn the call over to Phil, then we are going to come back and take your questions.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","Thank you, Evan. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong. Our loss reserves remain conservative. We have $102 billion portfolio of cash and high-quality investments that are well rated and liquid and we are generating substantial capital and positive cash flow.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion. We grew our tangible book value per share by 5.5% in the quarter. You will remember that at the close of our merger, the initial dilution to our tangible book value per share was 29%. As of the end of the third quarter, our year-to-date dilution has been reduced to 16%, an improvement of 13 percentage points in three quarters. Of course, that includes five points of benefit in unrealized gains because of lower interest rates.","In the quarter, investment income of $830 million was at the top end of our estimated range and benefited from strong cash flow and from the changes we are making to the management of our portfolio.","There are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income including the level of interest rates, prepayment speeds on our mortgages, corporate bond call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange.","Our expected quarterly investment income run rate remains at $820 million to $830 million. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $264 million pre-tax and include a $307 million gain from the investment portfolio primarily from a narrowing of credit spreads, a $44 million mark-to-market gain on our VA portfolio primarily from the improvement to equity markets and a $95 million loss from FX.","Our investments are in unrealized gain position of $2.5 billion after-tax. Net loss reserves increased $315 million for the quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 90%. We had positive prior period development of $349 million pre-tax or $252 million after-tax with about 20% from short-tail lines and 80% from long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2010 and prior. This included $52 million of adverse development for legacy environmental liability exposures which are now included in our corporate segment. As a reminder, we conduct our environmental review in the third quarter and our asbestos review in the fourth quarter.","Our catastrophe losses in the third quarter net of reinsurance were $144 million pre-tax or $107 million after-tax principally from U.S. weather related events. During the quarter, we purchased additional reinsurance that reduced our net written premiums by $260 million. $200 million related to personal lines, the remainder related principally to commercial lines.","The $200 million personal lines reinsurance premium included $128 million of one-time unearned premium reserve transfers which impact net written premiums for the third quarter only. Excluding the one-time transfers, the annual impact of personal lines of this new treaty is expected to be approximately $280 million.","As we have mentioned, we are increasing our estimate of integration related savings. There is no increase in our integration and merger-related expenses. Our tax rate of 18.4% is slightly higher than our normal range due to a higher tax rate on our positive prior period development because of the jurisdictions in which the development occurred.","I will turn the call back over to Helen.","Helen Wilson - Chubb Limited","Thank you. At this point, we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll go first to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. And thank you. The first question on the capital management and you generate in the first nine months $3.5 billion of operating income. You recovered more than one third of the tangible book dilution and debt leverage is towards the low 20% and you've purchased additional reinsurance, I'd assume, that would limit some of the earnings volatility. And also you said market is more competitive. So how do you think your current excess capital position and the potential buyback in 2017 and beyond?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Well, Kai, it's early days. We are pleased with building our capital position. It's in line with our own expectations. Capital management, we pay an awfully good dividend. We understand the potential for share repurchase and that always fits into our overall thinking when we look at all of our options and what we will do with our capital. Stay tuned. We are not in a hurry.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's good. And then thank you for all the details on the sort of new products. I just wonder what's the reaction from your distribution networks including the middle market about this new products and also if you're worried about sort of too much concentration in terms of a like a carriers from \u2013 more from the high net worth perspective. Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","For the small commercial that we just launched and that's in line with our plans as we told you from the very beginning and it's a book of business that we'll build over. It takes years to do. That's right in line and that goes to agents. And we've just begun really rolling out a real way and that will continue as our technology and product comes online into the middle of next year when it will be fully operational. But as far as agent reactions, very good and I'm going to turn it over for two moment \u2013 for a moment to Paul Krump who will give you a little more sense of the feedback we are getting in the marketplace.","Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.","Sure, Evan. I'd say that the agent feedback has been very positive. The new organization really hasn't missed the beat in terms of service to both agents and clients. I think the agents have been extremely complementary, how focused team is on finding solutions to our risk exposures.","Just one quick example. We were all recently at the CIAB and we ran into an agent who had a Fortune 500 CEO who had a personal lines risk and \u2013 but it included both the cattle and a horse ranch. And I would tell you that in the past legacy Chubb would have absolutely struggled to figure out a solution to that. And today, we were able to put that together in a very seamless way and our new capabilities in that area are unmatched and they'll only become crisper and better as we go along. So we are very excited about that.","As respect to the piece about some concentration, yeah, I would suggest to you that some of the agents have been a little concerned about the concentration. We have seen that more so and if anything in how they have moved some of the Fireman's Fund business. We expected that in the retention and that has shown up. You have to remember that that Fireman's Fund book was a conversion and we anticipated that there would be more price dislocation on the Fireman's Fund and that, as Evan said it in his remarks, will dissipate as we go forward.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Kai, the market reaction to the small commercial has been very good. As we have begun to roll that out. You know the legacy Chubb brand name with agency distribution and the relationships are so deep and as we bring additional product to market, they \u2013 the reception and the goodwill couldn't be better.","And I would remind you on the dislocation question. Sure, the concentration issue is an element with producers. Look at our renewal retention rate. We are holding the business and we are in fact writing the business. So while that tension and that dynamic is there, as Paul started saying to you, our capabilities are beginning to improve that we could do farm and ranch and do high net worth together starts opening up a whole another market dimension that others can't follow. And we have other product and technology plans on the drawing board that over the next two years will start \u2013 will roll out and continue to differentiate us.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Great. Thank you so much.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You're welcome.","Operator","Ryan Tunis, Credit Suisse.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess my first question is on the repositioning and investment portfolio and I guess if you guys could just talk a little bit more about the changes there \u2013 made there so far. And I guess potentially if there is an opportunity to even do more there, I guess, just looking at average yield on invested assets has been flat over the past few quarters? Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, well, when you say that I'm going to turn it over to Tim Boroughs but when you say that that's in the face of the declining reinvestment yield.","Timothy Alan Boroughs - Chubb Ltd.","Right. So Ryan, at this point we fully integrated the legacy Chubb portfolio with our investment process and operating platforms. So that's taking place. The assets have been placed with several of our managers with whom we share a long history of success. We have been working with these teams to implement strategic and tactical changes to the taxable, municipal and our international portfolios to improve risk-adjusted returns.","In addition, earlier this year, I think this is important, we shifted most of our equity portfolio into the upper tier of the BBB sector of the high yield bond market which had the impact of reducing overall portfolio volatility. This sector has returned over 14% this year versus a gain in stocks of about 7%.","The result of all these adjustments have produced additional net investment income of over $120 million annually above what the portfolio's run rate would have been since the time of acquisition. This has been accomplished with a better balance to our asset allocation, overall reduction in portfolio volatility while we have maintained an average rating of AA.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess just a follow-up on the additional reinsurance and the merger-related underwriting actions. And I know Evan pointed out that most of the action, if not all the action, so far has been taken on books that were planned at the beginning in the deal. But I'm just curious how dynamic that process still is. And if whether or not you are still finding books in areas where there are sizable opportunities, I guess, to improve either the volatility profile or the loss ratio profile of the business? Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Thanks for the question. No, we have been through the portfolio, and we \u2013 by the spring, so early in the second quarter, we had finished going through everything together. And we understood exactly where it either wasn't meeting our return expectations or where we had individual risk accumulations that would exceed our guidelines and appetite or we had aggregate risk accumulations concentrations that would exceed our appetite. So that's all done and we put in place our plans to either fix or get off of business or secure additional reinsurance.","Let me go a step further, though, because I think there is this question out there also, well, risk reward ratio and how do you think about that? And how do you as investors judge that?","First of all, I don't believe you can judge that, we can judge that, but you can't accept that how our ultimate results turn out. And I think we have a track record that speaks to pretty good underwriting and reinsurance as part of the underwriting process. We don't give away premium easily. Why would we do that? You ask yourself that question. We wouldn't.","Reinsurance and the way we look at things is not an expense. But it's rather a risk management and a capital management tool. We have very well-established use and guidelines in process to determine and manage our risk tolerances, our appetite for individual per risk volatility as an example. Our accumulations of how much we would take in anyone geography among our various products as they clash from a single event that might occur.","We have very sound capabilities to analyze the alternatives. The alternatives, do we retain the risk, do we reinsure it, and if we're going to reinsure it, what's the best reinsurance structure and the pricing alternatives? We can evaluate reinsurance pricing versus what we think a risk is worth. We can then track the results, gross and net and adjust as facts and circumstance both company and market change over time. So it's a very thoughtful process that we go through. And frankly the question you ask yourself if you are me in the very beginning when you do something a merger like this is do you worry about the optics of the premium revenue or do you just do what you know is the right thing to do to manage the business to give the optimal return on a risk-adjusted basis. And for me, it's a no-brainer. You just do that. And anyway, thank you for the question and I answered more than you asked.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful and I guess just one follow-up, Evan, is I mean clearly we have seen the cost in the NPW growth. I mean when you look at the results thus far, to what extent are we seeing the benefit of this? I mean do you look at this and think that all the underwriting actions and reinsurance you have done have improved results so far? Or do you think that's largely just still on the come. In other words, the benefit hasn't really played out at all on what you have reported?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Well, look, you can't measure with absolute precision. But what I will tell you is this. The actions you take are on a written basis and then that earns in over a period of time; generally a one-year period of time. So the results will \u2013 of that will emerge over time. It ameliorates margin pressure you get from rate reduction and trend, loss trend that occurs on your book of business. It ameliorates your results due to \u2013 you know from a single catastrophe or a series of catastrophes when they occur. It ameliorates your results in frequency of large losses if you have limited your per risk net because you don't think you are getting paid for that excess layer or have the spread of risk worth taking the volatility. And so you judge it over a period of time. But I think you are liking our underwriting results and it's all part of that.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks so much. That's more than I need.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You are welcome.","Operator","Elyse Greenspan...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","(34:26).","Operator","Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. First kind of high level question. We have a specter of inflation picking up next year. We have seen some of your peers report spinning reserve releases. Evan, do you think that it will reach a point where the industries start potentially taking more prices to get ahead of what could potentially be a painful inflection point in terms of inflation?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, let me just clarify one thing. Did you say inflation is taking off next year?","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I said there is a specter that maybe inflation could pick up when we get to next year.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, I think they just hang that ghost out there and it just hung there the last few years. Everybody looks at it and says maybe it's coming. Look, loss trend hasn't \u2013 it's not like there is no loss trend. There is inflation in claims. It varies by class. But it isn't like it has disappeared. It continues and you see it in certain classes where it rears its head and then in other classes it's there, it just is a bit more benign.","Pricing is flat or down and it's interesting to me the way I listen to people talk about the market because they will say, well, see the market is not softening because the rate of decline of prices has ameliorated. Well, that's almost \u2013 that's mindless to me. The rate is still going down, just going down at a slower rate. That's still softening. And even if it's flat, it doesn't keep trade \u2013 pace with loss cost trend.","So eventually, it's going to show up in results. When? I can't say with any specificity. And you know at that point when it shows up does that mean a market turns? It's a lot of capital. And there is a hunger for a rate of return. Even the insurance industry giving a mid-single digit ROE which is miserable on a risk-adjusted basis to me; that is attractive to many where there is trillions of dollars sitting in negative returns right now and just hungry for yield. And if they can get absolute yield of 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% on an absolute, forget risk adjusted basis, they are interested. So you just continue to see more capital coming into the business. So I am not imagining and I don't run our company, I can tell you, we don't build a strategy based on a market turn. We base it on the market we see.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a couple of numbers questions for Phil. How much of the integration savings came into the numbers in the third quarter?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","So third quarter actual realized savings from an accounting standpoint were $102 million and that would bring \u2013 so it was $28 million in the first quarter, you'll remember, $72 million in the second quarter and $102 million in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $202 million.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then what was the FX impact on EPS in the quarter?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","It was $10 million.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Did we take care of your worksheet?","Operator","Michael Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much. I guess you spoke a bit about developments on the commercial side in terms of the policy in small commercial. Can you talk a little bit about investments you have made on the personal lines side and maybe either new products or new geographies or further integration of those previously three separate brands? Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. We are making investments in the area and this is only a certain number of months, but they will roll out as we go along. So let me give you a little more color. We, first of all, have reorganized ourselves between all the disciplines, between actuarial, underwriting, marketing and sales where we can in a faster and more practical way react to each region in the United States which each one behaves a little differently where the States behave differently in terms of both competitive behavior and what we see from a financial profit and loss perspective of pricing.","Number two, we are right now in the middle of making investments and executing on actions around what will ultimately come out in the next \u2013 I'm not going to predict the month precisely, but we're going to start rolling out a digital experience around our high net worth business where customers will be able to interact with us and procure service and actually manage coverage in a more digital way.","Foundational technology, there is a need to make large investment to update and be state-of-the-art in our foundational technology around underwriting and claims, claims we've already done it and we will be investing in the underwriting side and plans are afoot to do that.","In product, Paul began to tell you one of the initiatives that we're already engaged in and that will emerge and that is the high net worth. There is a large segment to that population that has farm and ranch exposure. And you can't \u2013 typically you can't get it all from one carrier. We have the capability with our farm and ranch capabilities, as well as our high net worth capabilities. We are putting them together. We have already been piloting where we will be able to serve that segment and that distinguishes us from anybody else, one-stop shop.","Coverages around cyber liability, which on a personal basis and particularly for high net worth, is a new exposure. We've rolled out product to address that area before anyone else in the market did. And so you know we are \u2013 this is not something where you throw a switch. I mean I said from the beginning it would take a couple years but we have a lot underway.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. And then maybe just a quick one for Phil just on the reserve development, and we have seen some sort of divergent trends from other folks so far this year particularly this earnings season around development. Just curious if we will be able to get a little bit of color on whether the development came from legacy ACE or legacy Chubb and if the trends have been different from the two legacy books and how we should think about the standardization of those two as we go forward. Thanks.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","Let me start with \u2013 I will turn it over to Paul in a second, let me just start with \u2013 in general, this cycle was primarily related to the casualty book. I mean the most weight in our studies were casualty. But we also had some personalized development that I'll ask Paul to talk about.","Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, yeah, thanks. Thank you both. As Evan has mentioned on previous calls, we are integrating our actuarial process for all lines. And in doing so, we are bringing together much more credible data than previously available in the personal lines space as we've got the three big portfolios. And that data just caused us to increase our expectation slightly on the legacy ACE personal lines book. In particular, the homeowners and personal access lines were increased ever so slightly. Again, that's on the legacy ACE book, it's not in the personal auto. I suspect I know what you are pointing towards and it's not the auto.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","And then remember, it's on a base of a couple of, few billion dollars actually \u2013 $0.9 billion base (43:48).","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome.","Operator","Charles Sebaski, BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thank you. I guess a follow-up on the new initiatives with the BOP and small cyber in commercial. If we are taking a couple of years out, what's \u2013 how large of a component of the book to this part of the business be? Can these small policies, small risk component be a material component of the overall commercial business?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yes.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. Fair enough. We had another one on cross-sell and how the cross-sell opportunity set is with these small policies and personal line and then the A&H business. I guess I'm thinking in the U.S. Is A&H a differentiator in the Chubb, the larger personal lines book that you have now and are those pieces integrated or am I thinking about that wrong?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","No, you are thinking right. And I am going to start with an answer to you and then I wanted to take your question even a little broader and I'm going to ask Paul and John to talk a little bit about middle market cross-selling and what's going on in upper middle market. But let me take your A&H and by the way on small commercial when you ask could it be material? I am going to repeat to you one thing I have said before. First of all, it's about a $90 billion market in the United States. Number two, average premiums though keep in mind a couple thousand dollars. So it takes \u2013 you've got to write a lot of customers to build to cast a real shadow. In a number of years \u2013 in a few years, I expect that this will be a book of business with a B on the end of it, okay. That's what I mean by significant.","When you talk about A&H, it's in two pieces. First, in the combined, we do a worksite marketing and we have great technology and we now have quietly built over $100 million of business that is growing quickly where we are doing supplemental A&H products not traditional health. Sort of like the same thing that you would see Allstate or Aflac doing. We are competing very well in that business.","We have now introduced it to the Chubb independent agency distribution system right alongside our P&C offerings. And because most of the agents have an employee benefits division, and so we can come in where it is 50 to a couple of hundred lives, that's a sweet spot for us, and with technology and enrollers offer supplemental health products such as accident insurance, dread disease, hospital cash, et cetera, and that is a real initiative that we think has legs that over a number of years is going to grow substantial business.","Secondly, through our corporate A&H division as part of our major accounts and our middle market, traditional travel accident insurance and global business travel to corporations where they pay for the insurance for employees, we are \u2013 that is a real initiative for us and it is part of our cross-selling along with a whole host of other products that I'm going to ask John to start talking about and Paul and just give you a better sense of that cross-selling.","John W. Keogh - Chubb Ltd.","Sure. Thanks, Evan. And, Charles, yes, to Evan's earlier point, we've really focused on our cross-selling into our existing customer base and agency books. And also we call strength of the organization where we've added resources and distribution.","I will remind you that with the Chubb, we've picked up 48 branch offices that are just terrific assets for us. Some of the things that we are selling is clearly the specialty product that ACE brought to the table, things like environmental. Things like global programs, a broader access appetite, deeper financial lines, cyber, international, construction, transactional risk. These are all specialty plays that our branch operation is just doing a wonderful job at distributing and getting to our relationships and adding that cross-sell.","A couple quick examples on the upper middle market side. We had a global digital company where the Chubb organization had a small specialty product. This client needed a worldwide program from domestic casualty to international casualty and to the new ACE products with the Chubb relationship and the Chubb team and this organization holds together the rate in excess of $3 million deal. So, there's a number of those examples I can run you through, but it just brings to life one example where the organization has brought together additional capabilities.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","And I want to add one thing about that account and that was beyond the capabilities \u2013 it took the capabilities of both organizations. The product set that legacy Chubb brought and that legacy ACE brought by themselves, each one was hardly enough to win the day. The two together, there was no one who stood up to us in the competition. It was fascinating. Paul?","Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. Maybe just another quick example, because I think John did a great job outlining it. Going back to the strength of the organization an agent friend of mine told me a story where one of our clients in the personal lines world runs a business. It's in the healthcare industry. And this prospect of his was very anxious to get a Chubb quote. He explained to them that he didn't think that this risk was within Chubb's appetite. But he also admitted to the client prospect that, in fact, now that legacy Chubb has changed to new Chubb that the appetite has shifted as well because the legacy ACE was bringing on so many more capabilities and skills.","So he approached us. And he was shocked that within days we put together a very competitive program. The underwriter that he knew helped guide his colleague through the relationship and we wrote the account with several hundred thousand dollars. So that in itself is personally very satisfying for me. But what also is very satisfying is that this agent has really turned on to Chubb right now and their submission activities increased nicely.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I really appreciate all the answers. I guess just one final, if I could ask, might be helpful for us is on the personal lines business, I know there's a lot of work on re-underwriting and reinsurance. If possible, if we could get some PIFF data, potentially over time help us understand the trend of the book quarter-over-quarter would be appreciated.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","We will note that.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome.","Operator","Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. The 12% operating ROE in the quarter was very strong and you still have about another point of expense savings to realize. So is the 13% ROE about the way to view the right run rate for the company or was there lower than average losses this quarter, some seasonality in the business? Just trying to get a sense of the ROE profile for the new company?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, well, I think that's a \u2013 maybe a simplistic way, it's just still a mathematical way of looking at it. You've got to figure all the other factors. So you just loaded additional expense on top, let's see what happens to rate and trend and losses and mix of business and all the rest. I'm not projecting. I don't give guidance.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then the underlying...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You are welcome.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...the underlying combined ratio in the quarter remains steady despite your comments about market conditions. What's driving that and you view that as sustainable?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Not giving you guidance. On the other side of the coin, I feel pretty confident in our underwriting \u2013 in our ability to produce superior results relative to the industry. Our mix of business, our underwriting discipline, our willingness to shed business, to reinsure business, not to grow where it doesn't make sense and to grow where it does make sense, our global reach and our balance of businesses by geography, by country where we selectively determine to write each line of coverage, not mindlessly across the globe, but selectively decide which country to write which business in, our mix between middle market, small, and large commercial, our mix between specialty and traditional.","The fact in major accounts business where we have superior capability, so it's not simply about the cheapest price per shared and layered but that you bought the franchise and therefore it's our ability and primary casualty to be able to pay your claims, to be able to issue the paper all around the globe, collect the money and move the cash flow, pay the taxes for you and then write all the excess coverages. Our ability to write multiple coverages on you on a global basis and not simply one coverage, I think, all that goes into those results, Sarah.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for the answers.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome.","Operator","Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning. I've got a couple of unrelated questions. The first one is \u2013 I cover a lot of regionals which is, I guess, my problem. But they are all telling me that they are going after the high net worth personalized business. I think some of this maybe they are not really going up to really targeting your affluent as opposed to affluent, but it's hard for me to tell exactly how far up the scale they are going towards Chubb's business. So the question really is are you seeing those folks and are they indeed trying to take the incremental customer out of that truly high net worth marketplace?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","We are seeing the competition in one or two in the mass affluent space, creeping into the lower end of high net worth. It's a price play, offer a cheaper price. Having the broad coverages and the service capability, that's what it's really about. And so people are going to compete simply on price but not the same quality of product and service and that's the game. That's fine. You will always have that.","And as I have said from the beginning, we expect that with the merger, there would naturally be others who would come into the space. It makes sense. It ought to happen. That doesn't disturb us. But your ability to actually become a true high net worth player requires a lot of investment, a lot of patience, and because you've got to build a hell of a capability and service and you've got to be able to follow your customers where they have exposure. And by the way, you've got to have a balance sheet and appetite for greater volatility or risk because high net worth behaves like a commercial account, not a traditional personal lines account.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Great. And my other question which is completely unrelated. We have the impact from the Department of Labor coming up in April of next year. And there are some folks, I think, are very smart like the folks at Milliman that think that the \u2013 essentially you're going to again end up with very few 1035 exchanges and the retentions for in-force annuity books will just sort of skyrocket. You have a life reinsurance business haven't had an issue with it or seen much impact out of lately but if you saw a large increase in retentions in that in-force book, would that have a material impact positive or negative on your results?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","This is variable annuity business, not fixed annuity business. You realize that.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Yeah. I think that the thought is actually the variable annuity business will also \u2013 because a lot of those features are in the money will become un-transferable because they will have to explicitly estimate those \u2013 the value of those derivatives to the customer and it's very hard to swap them into something else if they are in the money.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. We will have to take that off-line with you but I would say this. We study the lapses in the annuitization rates on a regular basis. We react to the changes as we see them. You realize we write an XOL (58:54) book, an excess of loss book. That has been in run-off since 2007. Our lapses have been running to date better. They have been running lower, in fact, than we \u2013 than originally imagined and we watch those annuitization rates pretty carefully.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Fantastic. Thank you very much.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome.","Operator","Meyer Shields, KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Evan, one sort of big picture question in light of the quarter's reflection of pricing trends and sort of the overall economy. Are you more or less optimistic about the revenue synergies from the combination of ACE and Chubb than you were 6 months to 12 months ago?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, I am the same about the revenue synergies between ACE and Chubb, absolutely the same. What I can't speak about is, yes, the capabilities and our ability to bring those capabilities and differentiate whether it's new product and absolute like small commercial or bringing product to customer through \u2013 in middle market or in large account. I am absolutely right where I was about that. What I can't tell you is how much joy you get at any one moment for it depending on market conditions. And you know I expected a competitive market and we certainly got one.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","And remember this, which is very interesting to me. I told you that really you can't be Pollyannish about it that. In the beginning we would take some actions that would have dis-synergies, I hate the word \u2013 give me a better word where we would cancel some business, we would reinsure some business. So you'd reduce some premium revenue that growth initiatives would occur over a number of years and I said a three-year to five-year period to show a meaningful difference. We are keeping track of it.","At the same time, you are going to have on your basic book of business. You are going to have a certain lapse pattern and a certain new business pattern and if you are a disciplined underwriter that pattern is going to vary depending on the market conditions. Then you add the two together and there you go. But what I know \u2013 there you go as your ultimate growth rate, but what I know is we can measure the power of the integration from a revenue point of view and be able to track how one plus one is better than the two by themselves in any market condition. Are you following me?","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","I do. Yes, that's very helpful.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Okay. You are welcome. Did you have another question, Meyer?","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Just a very quick one in terms of the reinsurance purchasing. Is there any \u2013 I don't know guidance is the wrong word but ball-park you can give in terms of how the ceding commissions compare to the acquisition expenses?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","How the ceding commission compares to what?","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","The acquisition expenses on a gross basis.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, sure. The ceding commission is better than the acquisition expense. Otherwise, I didn't even cover my operating expense.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Let alone are you giving me a margin for my good business I'm giving you.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you.","Evan G.

I think about the environment and just as you are really emerging as this mammoth global company, two of your competitors are clearly pulling back. And I am wondering if you are seeing that in the number of submissions you are getting?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","We are not only seeing it in the number of submissions we are getting in that \u2013 particularly in that large account business but we are seeing it in the writings. John Lupica.","John Joseph Lupica - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, absolutely, thank you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","And then Juan Andrade.","John Joseph Lupica - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, Jay, there is no question in that global casualty business where we have invested a bunch of resource and time and people over the last 7 years to 10 years delivering a terrific product and being consistent with our pricing and our offerings. We are absolutely seeing opportunity from a couple of our competitors stumbling a bit. We are seeing more submissions and we are seeing more new business come into the portfolio at adequate rates. I remind you, we compare our new business to our renewal business and the adequacy is on par to our portfolio.","So that is one area when Evan noted our new business was up that we're definitely seeing new business increasing. It's all global casualty risk manager business. And that would include lead layer umbrella; that would include global property fronts and lead layer financial lines in there as well.","Juan C. Andrade - Chubb Ltd.","On the international side, Jay, I would add the same thing. We are really seeing more opportunity here as some of our competitors stumble particularly on the service side. We are seeing more risk managers coming to as we \u2013 the large brokers looking for essentially the franchise opportunities that Evan described given our multinational capability. So we see it in our pipeline but we also see it in our new business particularly in places like Continental Europe.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","And, Jay, the factor on the other side that stops us from writing all of it depends on is the market condition. They will come to us if they want the service now, are you willing to pay us the price we want? And in an awful lot of instances they are bringing in the risk and it's at a price that the expiring price is at a discount to what we think it's worth. And there you go. There's the bid\/ask and whether we are going to write it or not.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. The other question on the auto side. Obviously, there was some noise on the personal auto side, all the stock seemed to go down on some of those days. Our suspicion is that personal auto is a very small part of your business. Can you talk about how big that business is for you?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. Paul Krump is actually looking for his statistics at the moment. But, yeah \u2013 and our combined ratio is behaving pretty well. It's not a huge book for us. Paul?","Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. Just to level set again it is not a lead line for us in personal lines. I mean we generally write automobile only along with our other coverages for our customers. In addition our auto product really appeals to customers looking for much broader coverage and service particularly when it comes to vehicle repair and especially around safety systems. So I would tell you that we are just not the best source for confirming standard market auto trends. Our premium is much more skewed towards the homeowners and we have far more cars typically than we have drivers.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","We do see \u2013 and we have seen for a while what some others in the market have seen and that is there is a \u2013 particularly there's been an upward trend in severity. Look, the kinds of cars that our drivers drive are more valuable cars. The technology continues to evolve both in the materials used to manufacture the cars and the computerization, the digitalization of automobiles. And so that drives severity and we have seen that severity increase over a period of time we have been taking rate and we are making an underwriting profit in auto. And by the way, the volumes \u2013 look at page seven of the supplement you get the total \u2013 you get the volumes on a global basis.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Well, such is my experience because you write my house but you don't insure my crappy car, so...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Thank you. You are a friend, so I'll just withhold my comment \u2013 my report to you. You have teenagers in the house? I don't want them.","Operator","Ian Gutterman, Balyasny.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Hi. Thank you. I guess I have a comment, first, maybe building off the last comment there is I am looking forward to the new digitization in high net worth because the current Chubb website for homeowners feels like something out of the 1990s, so I'm hoping for something more customer friendly. So my first question on the cost saves. It looked like the incremental $50 million if I just compare the chart to the old chart, pretty much all comes in 2016, so it's basically already done or about to be done. A, is that accurate? And, B, can you give us a little color on sort of what's been done year-to-date and sort of where we see it? Is it expense ratio in the segments? Is it corporate? Is it LAE? Is there a way for us to sort of identify it, I guess, in our models or is it too broad-based?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","No, there is \u2013 I'll make that part short. There's no way for you to identify it.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You will not be able to. Number two, you'll identify it in the overall as you watch the expense ratio...","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Right.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","... and we can also identify to you in the loss ratio what percentage change in LAE exists then on \u2013 so we are tracking the savings. By the way, we track it in a very buttoned up mathematical way. It comes through finance and accounting. It's got controls around it. It can be audited both externally and by internal audit. And so we don't put out these numbers without real governance and control around it all and that's how we manage to it anyway. So it's all for real. And then what you have on the other side is what counterbalance is any investments you have that you make that will increase expense for normal inflation and expenses. So, we kind of track between the two pieces. Your question about the $50 million, no, it's not in 2016, it's in 2017 and 2018.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay. I have to go back and look at that again.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","And if you want, Phil, I think we are going to expand on that.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","I was just going to say that's right, it was across the years, the $50 million increase. And you can just compare to the first quarter disclosure, you'll see it.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Right. Before you had \u2013 so now you have $310 million of actual achieved in 2016 before you had $270 million \u2013 $275 million. That's why I'm saying it's mostly in 2016.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","Well, the realized was, I think, the $800 million is the annualized.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Is the annualized. Look at the annualized again.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, yeah.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay. I will follow up off-line that one. So...","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","We definitely did accelerate what we would have expected in 2016.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","But you will see that the additional $50 million is spread across the years.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it. And then just to follow up on the small commercial effort. I guess, Evan, can you help me understand sort of, I guess, what I am struggling with there, right, is that business is obviously as you said it's very low ticket, very sticky. It doesn't change carriers a lot and it's very dependent on sort of the experience with the CSR almost as much or more certain with the customer. What sort of your edge going to be? Is it going to be a new take-on service centers? Is it going to be a new take-on front-end quoting to make the CSRs want to do business with you instead of someone else? What sort of the hook, I guess?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","So the hook is a couple. First of all, in the agency, they are predisposed to grow their business with Chubb.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","The market concentration of this business when you think of the guys who are \u2013 that you would think of are the ones who are leading brands in it. Well, in aggregate, they have 20% market share of a $90 billion market. So it's incredibly spread. And there's a lot of carriers in there that frankly the agents, if you take the relationship and their \u2013 with Chubb they want to grow that relationship and they have more confidence in that. So you start with that.","Number two, our technology and our ability to quote find an issue and a four-minute to do it and that you don't touch? That's something that is a great differentiator to CSRs.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","And then that we will offer the total product package plus specialties wrapped around it that others don't have is a differentiator. So I think when you add all three together over time, we will grind this out and this is not a passing game where you make a 50 yard gain in one play. This is a grind it out foot by foot, yard by yard.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Well, that's surprising \u2013 that's what I was actually going to ask. Thanks a lot.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","And that's great. That's what we are in the business of. We are all not trying to get out of the business tomorrow. We are here for a long time building a company and this is part of the effort. So it's not something like what's the update every quarter? How it's looking? Come on, you measure it over years.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay. So is it a by agency approach? I mean you are trying to win over agents and get book roles one at a time or is it canopy to get it (1:13:30)","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","No, you go agent by agent, you love book roles, but that's again, that's like a short pass.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","That's what I'm wondering.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You go yard by yard and sure you would love book roles and maybe you'll get some of those, but you're taking a policy by policy.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Very good. Perfect, all right. Thank you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome.","Helen Wilson - Chubb Limited","We have time for just one more person to ask questions.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Remember, we don't have second careers around here. That's all we do. We've got all day for this.","Operator","Brian Meredith, UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks. Just a couple quick ones here for you. Evan, just looking at the global reinsurance business, big decline in premiums. Is that all just market related or are you seeing some customers shying away from you now that you're just a much bigger primary player and what is the outlook for that business for you guys?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","No, there is nothing related to \u2013 we have been a big primary player for a long time. There is nothing related to that, Brian. It is truly market. Our reinsurance folks, we liberated them a long time ago from volume. You will do the right thing to earn an underwriting profit or you will walk away from the business.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","And that's \u2013 all that's a reflection of and look, it's a little like the E&S business. In reinsurance, you have to be prepared in the way we run reinsurance, everybody a little differently. Where it has more volatility to it based on the market signature, you will have moments where you handle (1:15:15) the moments when you may grow very quickly and then you've got to be willing and prepared that on the other side there's volatility and you just shut like mad if you have to if your intent is to earn an underwriting profit. Wholesale E&S is next like that and it expands \u2013 the market expands or shrinks depending on market conditions.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then my next question for you, Evan, can you tell a little bit about what you are doing efforts to roll out the Chubb brand particularly in the personal lines side in some of your emerging markets platform that ACE used to have? Or it has, sorry.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, we are focused in just a couple of geographies around the world. We are focused in the U.K. There is a business and it has been a good business and we are putting more effort and more investment into that U.K. business and Juan is exploring a couple of places on the continent in a thoughtful way where there is opportunity we believe.","And beyond that, we are in Australia and \u2013 where we have a portfolio and are growing that. Other than that, it's where our customers emanating out of the U.S. or one of those markets may in fact have a property or an exposure in another country, then we have a Lloyd's platform that is used to be able to quote an issue that alongside their U.S. policy because they have a home in Mexico or they have a home in Colombia. So we can serve it on a global basis.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","The notion of expanding high net worth into a whole lot of countries, if you understand the market environment in those countries and the actual consumer behavior, there is \u2013 as we know it, there is not a high net worth market to be pursued in most markets of the world. That's just a fact.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. And it is more and more rolling out the Chubb brand in some of those emerging markets, does that kind of carry weight in areas like China and some other areas?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Well, it does carry weight. And we are pushing \u2013 I would say this, the ACE brand was a bigger brand in China, as an example. The Chubb brand \u2013 the conversion to the Chubb brand is \u2013 it gets the halo of what was the ACE brand because it's based on personal relationship more than anything. In the other markets of the world, the Chubb brand, ACE brand we are promoting the brand and building it.","And I think it's very well received. And I \u2013 there is a tremendous brand equity in that Chubb name. And it just has a distinguishing brand image in terms of service and claims like no other insurance company I know. And that is an asset. And that is an asset that we will promote that we will burnish that we are fiduciaries of and we will protect.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Evan G.

Please go ahead.","Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President - Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.","Thank you, and welcome to our March 31, 2016 first quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company and investment portfolio performance, pricing and business mix, economic and insurance market conditions including foreign exchange, and completion and integration of acquisitions including our acquisition of the Chubb Corporation, and potential synergies, savings and commercial and investment benefits we may realize. All of these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially.","Please refer to our most recent SEC filings, as well as our earnings press release and financial supplements which are available on our website, for more information on factors that could affect these matters.","Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. This is our first quarterly earnings report for the combined company, the new Chubb. As you know, we closed the merger of the Chubb Corporation during the quarter, the largest P&C insurance transaction ever done. Our earnings for the quarter were very good, while our premium revenue results were somewhat impacted by market conditions, foreign exchange and the merger, and I will explain. On a reported basis, after-tax operating income for the quarter was over $1 billion or $2.26 per share, compared to $2.25 per share prior year.","Since we closed on January 14, our reported results are missing two weeks of legacy Chubb earnings. For comparison purposes, when adjusted for that two-week stub period, operating income was, in fact, $2.29 per share as compared to $2.25 last year, quite good.","When discussing our underwriting results and premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the underlying health of the company, it's more insightful for you and relevant if we compare the new Chubb, excluding purchase accounting and one-time merger-related items that distort underwriting, to the 2015-year first quarter, as if we were one company since January 1, 2015. As an operator, this is the way I look at our results.","Therefore, on pro forma apples-to-apples basis, the new Chubb produced simply excellent underwriting results, highlighted by a calendar year P&C combined ratio of 88.9% and $720 million of P&C underwriting income. That was up 23% from prior-year first quarter. The P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was 88.8%. Pre-tax cat losses of $258 million in the quarter were lower than pro forma prior year by $57 million.","Positive prior-period reserve development of $247 million pre-tax was up $55 million versus prior year. Both global P&C, which excludes agriculture, and our agriculture business produced excellent calendar year and accident year underwriting results.","Net investment income for the full quarter was $812 million, again on a pro forma basis. This is a good result given the continued impact of foreign exchange and low interest rates, and it was right in line with our expectations. Book value per share was up 10% in the quarter and stands at $98.85, while per-share tangible book value declined as expected, reflecting the dilution from the acquisition. If the acquisition had closed December 31 \u2013 so, again, on a pro forma basis \u2013 tangible book grew 4%. Our annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 10.2%. Phil will have more to say about the investment portfolio, tangible book value, as well as prior-period reserve development and cat.","Turning to revenue growth for the quarter, on a pro forma basis, global P&C net premiums written, which excludes agriculture, were down 1% in constant dollars or $65 million. Foreign exchange impacted premium revenue results in the quarter by about 4 points. Renewal retention rates were very good, so the impact to growth was mostly new-business related. As expected, market conditions have grown more competitive around the globe, and that impacted us. I will speak about that later.","With the acquisition closing mid-January, there were also many merger-related activities in the fourth quarter and January\/February, with employees focused on executing integration and learning the new organization. However, we are moving past this and will continue to do so. We had improved new-business growth in March and then April. Momentum is building, and to the extent premium revenue was impacted by the integration, we are expecting improved growth.","Let me give you some more detail of our pro forma premium revenue results by major division, beginning with North America. For all of North America, including our commercial P&C business, agriculture and personal lines, net premiums written were down about 1.8% in the quarter. Let me break that down. In our retail commercial P&C business that serves the middle market and small commercial enterprises, net premiums were down 2%. The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was a solid 87%. Renewal pricing was flat in the quarter, and both exposure growth and rates were essentially flat. General and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 1%, financial lines pricing was up about 2%, and property-related pricing was down 1%. New business writings were down 4% year-on-year.","In our businesses serving large corporate customers and specialty E&S markets, what we collectively call Major Accounts & Specialty, net premiums were down 5%. For our retail broker distributed Major Accounts business, the renewal retention rate as measured by premium was a very strong 91.5%. Pricing for the business we wrote overall was down 1%. General and specialty casualty related pricing was down about 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down 2%. And property-related pricing was down about 4.5%. New business writings were down 32% year-on-year, impacted by market conditions, plus merger-related focus, particularly again in January\/February. New business activity in this division has, in fact, improved in March and April.","Our North America personal lines business had a reasonably good quarter, with net premiums up 7.5% in constant dollars. Excluding the impact of Fireman's Fund, growth was over 3%. Rates were up 1%, and exposure change was a positive 3.7%. Net premiums for our agriculture business were down 27% in the quarter, primarily due to the premium gain\/loss sharing formulas with the U.S. government for the 2015 crop year, which, by the way, was an excellent underwriting year. In fact, as we begin this year's growing season, and as far as we can tell, we have gained market share, and the number of farms we will be insuring may very well be at an all-time high.","Turning to our international business, results were pretty good, and in fact better than we planned. Net premiums written for our global retail P&C business were up in the quarter nearly 4% in constant dollars. Growth varied depending on territory and product. Asia Pacific was up 6%, Latin America was up 4%, and Europe was up 2%. From a product perspective, commercial P&C net premiums grew just over 1%, which was a bit slower than expected. A&H grew 3%, and personal lines grew a strong 12%.","In our London market-based E&S \u2013 Excess and Surplus lines business \u2013 premiums were down 12% due totally to market conditions. Just as an FYI, as contemplated by us when we initially planned the merger, in 2016 and 2017 we plan to shed or shrink net written premiums in certain portfolios, simply because we cannot earn adequate underwriting returns or because we want to reduce net cat-related exposures. These actions will benefit both the returns and the risk\/reward profile of the company. We will update you periodically as to the impact this has on our net written premium growth rates. This will be in addition to the business-as-usual underwriting actions we take as market conditions warrant.","Concerning market conditions, we are seeing a really great response from agents, brokers and customers all over the world and in all regions of the U.S. about the new Chubb. On the one hand, for agents, the combination of our commitment to the independent agency system, the service levels and attention they are experiencing, and the new products and capabilities we are and plan to bring to them are creating a lot of excitement and goodwill.","For brokers and large-account clients, the size and quality of our balance sheet, our enhanced global capabilities (both service- and product-related), our consistency and focus in contrast to the problems they are experiencing with others, are all attracting more opportunity and our pipeline is building. I might add, the continuity of the employees our agents and brokers are working with at the local, regional and home office levels is both confidence-building and much valued by both our agents and brokers. This includes our outstanding claims and loss control organization, which hasn't missed a beat in terms of responsiveness.","The pricing environment continues to grow incrementally more competitive, particularly in shorter tail lines. And, again, it really varied depending on the territory, line of business, and size of risk. As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more competitive than mid-sized, wholesale is more competitive than retail, and property is certainly more competitive than casualty-related, though casualty pricing in the main is not keeping pace with loss cost trends.","None of this is a surprise. During the quarter, for our large middle-market commercial business, pricing was marginally better than we had anticipated, and for Major Accounts, about in line with expectations. John Keogh, John Lupica, Juan Andrade, and Paul Krump can provide further color on the quarter and current market conditions and pricing trends.","On another subject, namely integration-related savings and the one-time costs associated with realizing them, as we continue to do our work, we are providing an update to our initial disclosures regarding value creation and efficiencies. In terms of integration-related savings, we are now projecting to exceed our original target of $650 million, or $610 million at current foreign exchange rates, and expect an annualized run rate of approximately $750 million by year-end 2018.","Total one-time costs related to the merger are expected to be $811 million and consist of one-time expenses of $525 million directly attributable to achieving the $750 million savings and other one-time expenses of $286 million related to the merger, such as transaction costs, branding and employee retention costs. In addition, as a result of the merger, by the fourth quarter we are also now projecting an improvement to our annualized investment income run rate of $100 million to $120 million in what we would otherwise earn as we improve investment portfolio management. Phil will have more to say, including the timing by year for achieving integration-related savings and the related costs, as well as the timing for achieving the improved investment income run rate and how you should think about that.","We are on track with all of our integration plans, including organization structure, process, people, technology, and growth initiatives, which are at a very early stage. Integration is going as expected, including cultural integration, which is going well. As we've said from the beginning, you don't just wave a wand and put two strong cultures together. It takes some time. It's a process that you pay attention to, that you care about and that you lead. While there are some differences between our two cultures, they are not profound. We are far more alike than different. As we focus on day-to-day business activities, we are breeding familiarity and knitting ourselves together at every level of the company. All employees, starting with leadership, are invested and paying attention.","Our organization is stable, and in fact it is doing well. Our people are more and more engaged and focused on serving clients, writing business, and overall value creation. Again, client retention is excellent and customer and distribution partner reception in the marketplace has been outstanding. In sum, we're off to a really good start, and the value creation that will come from our company is greater than we imagined when we announced the acquisition.","With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back and we're going to take your questions.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Evan. This is our first quarter as the new Chubb, and we're starting out in an exceptionally strong financial position. We have a very strong balance sheet to support our business activities around the globe, with total capital exceeding $59 billion. Our loss reserves are conservative and in great shape. We have a $99 billion portfolio of cash and investments that's highly-rated and liquid, and we're generating substantial positive cash flow. Adjusted net investment income was $767 million in the quarter. This was within our expectations when factoring in the 14 days of investment income prior to the close of the acquisition on January 14, which amounts to approximately $45 million.","As Evan noted, we've analyzed the investment portfolio and believe that through more active management we can raise the run rate of investment income higher than it otherwise would have been by approximately $100 million to $120 million annually without taking any significant additional risk. We plan to maintain a high level of quality with our AA rating and keep duration at approximately four years.","This increase in investment income, together with future operating cash flow, will help to offset the natural impact of reinvestment at lower new-money rates. Our current book yield on the portfolio is 3.4% and new money rates are 2.5%.","Before the improvements in investment portfolio management, we would have expected quarterly investment income to be in the range of $790 million to $810 million. Now, with the improvements, we expect quarterly investment income to be in the range of $820 million to $840 million for the balance of the year. As a reminder, the estimated investment income run rate is subject to variability in portfolio rates, call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange.","Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $952 million pre-tax and include a $846 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from the decline in interest rates; a $244 million mark-to-market loss on our VA portfolio, also primarily from the decline in interest rates; and a $350 million gain from FX. Before you ask, hedge fund investments represent less than 0.5% of our portfolio. They have never been a significant part of our strategy.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was a little over $1 billion, and $1.3 billion when adjusted for the 14-day stub period and one-time merger-related costs. Tangible book value per share was down 25.5%, reflecting the expected dilution of 29% at the acquisition close, offset by our strong earnings and the net realized and unrealized gains I just mentioned.","Net loss reserves increased $21.4 billion for the quarter, largely due to the Chubb acquisition. On a pro forma basis, loss reserves increased $125 million, adjusting for foreign exchange. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 97%. Adjusting for cat losses and prior-period development, the ratio was 92%.","Cat losses for the quarter were $258 million pre-tax, primarily from U.S. weather events. Prior- period reserve development was positive $247 million pre-tax, and comprised $135 million from long-tail lines, principally from 2010 and prior, and $112 million from short-tail lines. The positive short-tail development includes $41 million relating to agriculture for the settlement of the 2015 crop year.","Our Life segment earnings were negatively impacted by $9 million after-tax of unfavorable claim reserve development in our U.S. combined insurance operations and the run-off of our VA reinsurance book.","Our press release includes a table showing our expectations for the amount and timing of the recognition of integration savings and one-time integration expenses over the 2016, 2017 and 2018 years. We also include the annualized run rate for savings we will achieve by the end of each year. For 2016, we expect the expenses to be weighted more heavily to the first half of the year and the savings to be weighted to the second half.","Our tax rate on operating income from the quarter is 16.5%, which is in the range of the expected annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. Quarterly tax rates will vary based on where our income emerges. For example, the first quarter tax rate is at the low end of the range due to the timing of the integration savings, which again are weighted to the second half of the year, and front-end purchase accounting amortization.","As additional color, embedded in our annual effective tax rate estimate is the impact of our higher debt leverage. As part of the transaction, we have an intercompany loan that benefits our tax expense by $19 million in the quarter. We are comfortable that the loan will not be affected by the recent treasury guidelines. The combination of our internal and external financing of the Chubb acquisition favorably impacts the annual effective tax rate by approximately 2 points, which is contemplated in the range that I noted.","Lastly, I'll point out that we have added some disclosures this quarter as highlighted in our 8-K filing last week. We now show our North America Personal Lines business as a separate segment, and we're providing premium information for the regions of our Overseas General Insurance segment. We plan to provide a global line of business written premium chart in the second quarter.","We have also provided pro forma underwriting information for 2016 and 2015 that shows 2016 without purchase accounting adjustments related to the Chubb transaction, and includes the 14 days of January before the acquisition closing for comparative purposes.","As a reminder, when estimating our net written premium growth for the second quarter, last year's quarter included $252 million of one-time benefit from Fireman's Fund that will not repeat. Therefore, when Evan referenced improved net written premium growth that we expect in the second quarter, that growth is over a 2015 base that does not include the one-time Fireman's Fund benefit.","I'll turn the call back to Helen.","Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President - Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.","Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will go first to Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you. First question is on the expected merger synergy about \u2013 raised to $750 million. And also the pace of the realization seems faster than originally anticipated. So, could you give more detail about so why it's bigger now, and what's the difference from what you'd previously anticipated, as well as the pace of it?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, the pace of it, you already have. We gave you a chart that shows you, by year, the annualized and the realized of the expenses, I don't think anybody gives you that. And so you have that clarity already. The $750 million \u2013 the increase, it doesn't come from one place. It comes from actually many places. As we've simply done more ground-up detailed work, it comes from operations all over the world, and it's more focused in support operations and back-room than it is in any front-room activities.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Outside these merger synergy and increased investment income, are there other areas you think there could potential opportunities for the combined entity?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. We will update you periodically if anything materially emerges beyond that. I think the real ultimate benefits, which take time, and which are really the vision of it, is revenue-related growth synergies, and those are at a very, very early stage, but we're already beginning to see benefits there in terms of the increased product capabilities we bring to customers at distribution.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Then to just follow up on that, potential revenue growth opportunities, could you talk a little bit more about sort of three specific area in terms of high net worth and also middle market commercial lines, as well as international opportunities?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. In high net worth, what did you want me to tell you?","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just wondering, like, is that how the integration has been, and because we recently heard some of the competitors essentially hiring likely Chubb people, try to start a business there. Do you see potential lose of business, and what's the area of growth from current levels?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","First of all, when we did the merger, we imagined \u2013 it doesn't take a lot of imagination, in fact, to imagine that as a result of putting three of the four major players in high net worth together, that you would ultimately breed additional competitors in that space. And I've said that from the beginning, and that is a healthy thing. The market needs choice, number one.","Number two, the \u2013 it isn't about the roughly $10 billion high-net-worth market, or $8 billion or whatever it is, that exists today. It's about the market that we imagine is in the $30 billion or $40 billion range of those who require or really need a richer product that is rich in service, rich in coverage, rich in benefits, and more about service and benefits than it is about price. And those individuals who have a lifestyle and assets to protect are insured in more standard lines companies right now. And the long-term play is to attract them and serve them in the high-net-worth market. So that's the real play.","What I'd say about competition is pretty simple. To step up to the standards and the level that Chubb represents, which is the gold standard of the business, requires years of investment and attention. You don't build something like this overnight. The capabilities you have to bring in terms of service capabilities, both risk and engineering services to individual customers, and the claims service capabilities, and the richness of the coverages, and the ability to service them all over the globe. Well, I'll tell you what, that's not an easy lift, and you win these customers one by one, and the average premiums can vary anywhere from $5,000 to a couple of $100,000. It's hard work.","So to anybody entering the space, it is a good business. And if you do it right, it takes a lot of patience, a lot of capital, and good luck. And by the way, we'll put the welcome mat out for you.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's good. When do you expect those revenue growth opportunity will emerge materially to the income statement?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not speculating on the period. But what I did say is, you would \u2013 I did say initially, and I hold to that, that we expect for all the efforts we're doing right now that are revenue-related, they will really begin to show in a material way by year three. Though we're already seeing it in cross-sell around the organization as we bring more specialty and our large account capabilities to the middle market and agency distribution that we have. And we will, as we have something meaningful to say about that, update you as we go along. And that I don't expect as a year three, I expect that's a year one, two, and three.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Well, thank you so much for the answers.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Evan, I guess my question is just on new business in North America. It sounds like that was more of an issue this quarter potentially than retention. Just wanting a little more detail on what was driving the softness there, it sounds like earlier in Q1. And what's allowed things to improve more recently?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Ryan, you see, or you heard me say it, it was more large account than it was in the middle market area, though middle-market new business was down about 4%. Large account was down around 30%. January was a much tougher month in terms of new business than February, and March was better, and April was better than March as we go forward.","So we know a combination of things as we look at it. Definitely there was \u2013 it was a more competitive environment in January. And January is always a competitive month relative to other months. Matter of fact, if \u2013 I have to tell you, the softer part of cycle, you're better off to try to write your new business in the off months of a quarter. January is tough, April can be tough, March\/April, and June\/July is like January, the way people go after it. And they have some growth objectives that they want to achieve. So, there was some impact from that, and we see that.","But in the fourth quarter, we had a lot of people \u2013 we focused for six months very intensely on planning the merger. And there were sort of 11th-hour jitters of people as we come up to close and everybody is focused on to a degree of the integration and the structure and who am I working for and what is my job. And then the integration itself, all the planning of that, just takes time, and it's some time away from working on new business.","And January, and to a degree February, is impacted by your activities in the fourth quarter, which is November\/December. And then we close the middle of January, so everybody then has to execute. And there is just a mountain of execution when you take it by function, by area of business, by geography, all over the world.","And I'm very proud about how we've executed, because people have done it \u2013 it's been in a \u2013 there haven't been a lot of surprises, everybody's known what to do, and it's gone very smoothly. And then people have been \u2013 spent a lot of time getting to know each other, and getting to know what the capabilities were and learning the products of each other before you can take it out to market. And we could really begin to feel that start to take hold in February, move into March, and as it moves into April it just keeps on building. So, maybe that gives you a little sense.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then my follow up is just on small commercial. I'm just hoping you could a little bit more about the opportunity there, now that you've brought out more detail on it, I think, from a product standpoint earlier in the quarter. And just how important is the small commercial initiative overall to your revenue synergy outlook over the next few years? Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As is characteristic of, I suppose, of our organization and of me, I'm not going to do a lot of talking about something that we're building and planning. I'm hardly going to stick a roadmap out there. And we let results and activities speak. But we have all the parts and ingredients, we have the sticks to rub together and make fire. And we have the distribution, we have the data and the know-how, and we have the insight, we have the focus, we have the resource that we're putting attention to, we have the roadmap for technology and we're coming.","And we are building right now, and focused on building \u2013 we already had, between the organizations, a nascent, what I call a nascent small commercial business, modest, very modest in size, and specialty-oriented. And that continues. Those efforts continue, and they have a reasonably aggressive plan in action \u2013 a set of actions to achieve results in 2016. But that's not the main event for us. This is an $80 billion marketplace, and we intend over the next number of years to grow \u2013 to be a meaningful player.","I might say, a little like I said about high net worth, you really have to \u2013 it takes time to build capabilities, to build all the services and product know-how, to have the right insights into pricing, and to execute, because it's work-intensive. The average premium sizes are small, it's high transaction volume, and you've got to win over and wire up the distribution, and we are focused on all of that. And so, over the next few years, I expect that to grow and be a meaningful contributor to our business, and as it's appropriate, we will update you more specifically.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks for the answers...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Don't look for much out of me in 2016.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And appreciate the good new disclosure and information on the merger you guys gave.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","First question, Evan, I guess is on the Personal Lines, on international. The growth was strong there. And curious what parts or regions you're seeing and how the brand change, I guess, is working on international. Obviously, the Chubb brand I think has better name recognition in the U.S. than it might internationally. And curious about how the international Personal Lines is going.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, the brand change had no impact on our revenue growth in the quarter. The growth is pretty broad-based. It came from both specialty and traditional. It came from a wide range of geographies, from Mexico to Malaysia to Europe, where we do a lot of specialty, so broad-based. In Mexico it's automobile and small commercial-related, but automobile in particular. In Malaysia it's auto and, again, specialty and small commercial-related. We write cell phone insurance out in Asia, and that had nice growth. In Europe we write cell phone-related insurance, and that had really nice growth.","So, it isn't from one place nor one geography, and it isn't traditional versus specialty, it's broad-based. But it's very \u2013 when I say broad-based, we're very targeted and focused about where we choose to do Personal Lines and how we choose to do it. It's easy to put on a lot of revenue in that business. It's not easy to do it and make a decent margin.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","What's the opportunity on the high-net-worth business on the international front, as opposed to how \u2013 the size of the business in the U.S.? Is that a meaningful focus for you guys now, or...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a focus. Meaningful? It's nothing like the United States. And it's not going to \u2013 I don't think of it in terms of \u2013 if I think of the U.S. as high net worth is a meaningful business, I don't think of international high net worth that way. I think of it as a good business. It's a very good business and a good opportunity. But it's really focused in a limited number of territories. UK, Australia, maybe a little bit on the continent, that's the majority of it. The balance is small pockets of high net worth, and that's mostly serviced by us out of our London operation.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks. And just one final one, and maybe it's for Phil. On the tangible book value calculation that you guys do, the tangible \u2013 the goodwill is done net of tax...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes it is.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","...which I think is different than how you did it before. Just trying to understand how that \u2013 to expect to flow through going forward?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It would definitely be done net of tax. Goodwill and other intangibles would be reflected net of tax in our calculation of what tangible book value represents.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And will that tax basis off the goodwill, will it be fluctuating over time or going down, or is that kind of \u2013 it seemed like the goodwill, in historic, kind of stayed flat. So I'm just wondering if that's something that's going to change.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It should not. It would decrease in relation to the amortization of the intangibles.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you very much for the answers, guys","Operator","From Barclays, we go next to Jay Gelb.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I was hoping you could expand a bit more on the opportunity to gain market share resulting from several of the other large global commercial insurers facing some dislocation, in terms of the brokers looking to have stable capacity for their customers?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I've talked about this a little bit in the past. And so I'm going to \u2013 I'll talk a little more about it. The first thing I'll tell you is, is it's a double-edged sword and you got to be careful. On one hand, as I said the last time, when there's a wounded animal loose, be careful. Stay out of the way and don't try to corner it.","On the other hand, look, we represent \u2013 and that's what I tried to say in my commentary \u2013 we represent a very attractive market, an alternative for large accounts seeking a deep balance sheet, great underwriting expertise, as you know, great reputation for service, global capability, broad product offering and services. There are \u2013 and by the way, which has become more and more the play in large account business, your technology, your ability to deliver in a way that the service standards are met, the service expectations are met \u2013 and those standards of service have only risen, the expectations have only risen over the last decade, in the last five years and three years.","People expect great data, great information in a very rapid way, self-served way where they can serve themselves. We have that technology. Very few have that. Our ability to move money, our ability to service self-insureds, our ability to risk engineer, our ability to provide primary casualty coverages, including professional lines, all over the world, and service claims, very few can do that. And we have been stable in terms of our capacity offering and our approach to underwriting and\/or pricing. Sometimes the market moves closer to us, when the market is more disciplined in terms of underwriting. Sometimes the market moves further away from us because others are willing to sell something at a price we consider too cheap or at terms we consider too broad.","So, on one hand, we're in a market where it's competitive and some things are being sold at prices that are below costs we think are reasonable. On the other hand, there is this pull and desire for stability and certainty and familiarity, and that is drawing more towards us. So I can tell you, we just came back from RIMS. All of us there, I have not seen a reception towards our company in \u2013 towards this company, I don't think I've ever seen the reception like I saw at RIMS. We were really popular kids on campus.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks for that. And then for Phil, should we still think about, in terms of share buybacks, no activity for 2016, but perhaps more likely in 2017?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have no plans at this point for buybacks, and we'll keep you posted as we go, as we see how our capital develops.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions, if I could, quickly on Personal Lines within the overseas segment. You mentioned the growth there. What does the profitability look like in that book? Is it closer to the segment overall, or is it closer to what you generate in the North America personalized business?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I am hardly going there.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Okay, well then back to the U.S. Do you think that in that book, that you have an opportunity to grow at these levels of profitability? I mean, is there still enough room in that high-net-worth segment, either because of your consolidation really or because of the expansion of that market, for you to grow consistently?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And, Michael, on international, the profitability meets our hurdle rates, and it meets our underwriting standards or we wouldn't be doing it. But I'm hardly going to put a roadmap out to others. On the domestic and margin, there's been questions to us of, well, now that you're so dominant in that business, we assume you're now going to now, in a sense, be predatory, take advantage, raise prices, et cetera. Increase margins.","I think there's a na\u00efvet\u00e9 about all of that, and I think that's wrong. Our approach is to earn an adequate risk-adjusted return in the business. The business does that reasonably well today. There is a lot of risk in the business. The business is regulated. You have to file your rates, and they have to be just \u2013 they have to be actuarially justified, and we do that. And that adds a complexity, but adds a stability as well.","Secondly, we want to win customers by offering a great service at a fair price, and hardly do we want to try to push it where we make our money simply on \u2013 try to make more money on the cohort we have, rather than grow the cohort, if we're making an adequate risk-adjusted.","So, with all of that, what I'd say to you is, we see stability as we look forward in the margins in the business, and we don't consider that we're making excessive returns. On a risk-adjusted basis, we are not. We're making reasonable returns.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then, is there a material difference between legacy Chubb's acquisition cost in sort of the personalized business versus legacy ACE's? And is that something \u2013 if there is, is that an opportunity for the combined company?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There is not. Agents are \u2013 they are very efficient when it comes to acquisition cost, and they are a great market leveler, and they are highly intelligent.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Great. Thank you very much.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Up next is Vinay Misquith of Sterne Agee CRT.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Hi, good morning. The first question is on the premium growth. There was a modest 1% premium decline this quarter, I guess because of competition and some integration. And curious, Evan, if you could parse out what was the bigger impact, and when do you think the drag from the integration will recede?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Vinay, I think I just have gone on about that for the last 20 minutes. And I think my commentary said it. So, I can't \u2013 if you're looking for a point estimate, a numeric estimate of what was specifically integration-related versus market-related, I can't give you that. Nobody knows that.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay, sure.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But I can tell you that the market \u2013 market discipline, for those who are disciplined in underwriting, absolutely is having an impact on growth rate, and you could see that as you look at players who have reported. And that definitely has an impact on us. And you know there were times, and I've said this, I've been very clear, that there are times that revenue is for vanity, and revenue growth is for vanity, and it's best you take your eye off of that.","And there are pockets of the business, many pockets of the business where I and my colleagues think that it's not an overly attractive market, and you better discriminate very carefully on what you choose to write and how you choose to write it, if you want to maintain underwriting margins. And that's our first objective. So I will shed revenue without a tear in any class, in any line of business, where we can't make an underwriting profit, period. And you know that about us.","The retention rates were very high. And that to me shows me the market reaction towards us and the demand for business from Chubb, from doing business with Chubb, by both distribution and customers, and the good work of our people. When I look at the pattern of new business and how it came in, and where it came in, and the timing of it, it's very clear to me that the integration \u2013 and in discussions with our people \u2013 that the integration had an impact. And when I look at how we're moving month-to-month, I can see that beginning to recede. And people really getting on without getting out there and driving for it.","So I see a combination of both impacting it. I can't do anything about the market, and that will be what it will be. But I can tell you, getting the organization focused, that is something we can do something about. And we're all focused on that. Everyone is out there. We've been to many regions, to many offices, working with our people and helping them to get on the front foot, and I feel really good about the energy level and the focus of the organization that is taking hold. And to the extent that that impacts revenue growth, you can look forward to improved results as we go forward.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","No, that's helpful. The second question is for Phil. And first of all, thank you so much for the expanded disclosure. That's really helpful and is helping all of the sell-side with these \u2013 our numbers. From the expense synergies, how much of that was actually realized in the first quarter?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, the actual accounting saved in the first quarter was $29 million.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","And that's helpful. Thank you.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","And from UBS, we go next to Brian Meredith.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. Just two quick numbers questions, and one other one just quickly. So, Phil, on the $100 million to $120 million of additional investment income, what's the after-tax number?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let see. Let's call it $75 million on the low end of the range. So $100 million translates into $75 million.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Terrific. And then second question, exposure to couple of earthquakes we've seen recently, and some of the activity in Texas?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We will have losses from the activity in Texas, from the earthquake in Latin America, from the earthquake in Japan. From the two earthquakes, from what we know at the moment, our losses will relatively modest. Nothing outsized. And from the losses in Texas, normal spring losses, you expect these kinds of losses in the springtime. It's the volatility of weather. More tornado-related activities, severe storm related, flooding, hail, all occurs, as we know, in the second quarter. And so this kind of activity, so far to date, what we're seeing is not producing losses beyond what we would imagine or expect.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then last question, Evan, you struck this relationship with Suning and, hopefully, I'm pronouncing that correctly, in the quarter. Could you give us \u2013 elaborate a little bit on what the potential is there for that relationship, how quickly you expect it to ramp up?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I expect it to ramp up and begin showing \u2013 potentially, you don't know with certainty, but potentially \u2013 real premium revenue in 2017. It is direct response marketing in all its forms, digital, phone-based, predominantly of simple accident-, travel- and credit-related products, maybe some small commercial; householder's-type products to serve the customer base of Suning, that is approximately 130 million people that are active users of Suning. Suning has about 1,500 \u2013 thereabouts, I'm sure I have the number wrong, but thousands of stores throughout the country, and then they have a very large, very active online business. They serve financial needs of over 30 million customers, and we will be active \u2013 and do it in a digital way, and we will be actively marketing to those.","The cooperation \u2013 it's one thing to sign one of these. It's another thing that actually operationalize. And we're just beginning the operational phase. And this is something that the real meaningful benefit will come over a few years. But Suning, in very early days, is showing to be a very active and cooperative partner and is giving us a lot of access to data, a lot of encouragement in terms of use of their distribution, and is very welcoming with building the business, and I'm grateful for that effort. So, this could be \u2013 we're cautiously optimistic this could be a great venture.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","And it's on your paper or Ho Tai's paper?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, this is on our paper. It's on Chubb.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Great. Thank you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've got 100% of this.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Perfect.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the call. So, listen, I just wanted to touch a bit more on growth from more of a long-term perspective. Obviously, we all think of you as a growth company, but with the moving pieces of the market and integration, it was obviously a flat quarter. When you, Evan, look across the portfolio and look a couple of years out, what kind of long-term organic growth rates do you guys think are potential? And I think this is an important question for us, because it's hard to figure out from the outside, given all the different growth businesses you have at legacy ACE \u2013 and in combination with, obviously, the legacy Chubb opportunity. And I would really love to get a sense of what you're shooting for, and what you think may be able to get through the cycle, kind of long-term underlying organic growth potential might be?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, I'm going to answer \u2013 give you two answers. First, you didn't define growth the way I define growth. And the way, therefore, we define growth \u2013 a growth company for us. A growth company in this business is growth in book value and tangible book value. That's how you define growth in a risk business. Not revenue growth, which is an overly simplistic way. Ultimately, you have to gain revenue growth as well. So I reject that notion of what's a growth company.","Number two, we will \u2013 we don't give guidance. And so I'm not going to start giving guidance about revenue growth. But I will say this to you. I firmly believe that whatever the growth rate was projected \u2013 and at ACE, we do long-term \u2013 at ACE, we did long-term five-year plans. We would roll forward every year. And we had a projection of what we thought our growth rates would be over a coming five-year period. I have a sense of what Chubb, legacy Chubb, would have thought of its growth potential over a two-year to three-year period and what they would have seen.","I do firmly believe that when you sum those two together, the two together will have greater growth than the two would \u2013 the sum of the two separately would. There is little doubt of that in my mind. How significant? We have ranges internally from what we think might be conservative to what we think might be more aggressive, but when I pitch it up the middle, I think it will be meaningful. And I did say that I thought that by the fifth year, it would come into the billions of dollars range, and multiples of billions, and I believe that, from what it otherwise would be. While that's not a \u2013 what you wanted as an answer from me specifically, I hope that gives you some insight.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Sure. Sure. We'll take it and work with what we can. If I just were to ask you more tactically, managing risk through the soft market is a major focus for a lot of investors. Could you walk us through a little bit of your sort of tactical playbook as you think about maintaining margins through the next three years or four years?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, maintaining margins is about underwriting, and it's about underwriting selection, and it's about your portfolio. What I love is the balance of business in this company. By geography, when I look at opportunities through Asia, when I look at opportunities in Latin America, when I look at opportunities through the United States, and I just look geographically, I see \u2013 and in Europe \u2013 I see so much room to move, where there are some territories and some lines of business that, you know, to maintain margin you need to shrink. I see other areas where we have the capabilities, we have the presence, and it's about execution to grow in those areas. And when you have the data we have and the knowledge we have, putting that to work, it is a job of execution at that point.","When I look at our spread of business by type of business, by customer, from large segment where it's obviously \u2013 except for the dislocation of others that put some wind at your back, it's obviously the more difficult area to grow. And in fact, you're going to go sideways or shrink in many areas of that business if you're going to maintain underwriting discipline. But I then look on the other side of the coin at the middle market, and the capabilities we have in that area, and our reputation and our relationships and our ability to drive more product and grow that more quickly, that just gives me a lot of optimism.","I look at our A&H business around the world. I look at our personal lines business, both in the United States and outside the U.S., and potential in that area, I add it all up. And there are areas where you apply the gas and then areas where you apply the brake. And we know how to do that quite well. And as I said, I will never get baited into revenue growth to maintain margins. And when my guys are feeling a little bad because they have to shed business to maintain margin, I got to tell you what, I suck it up and I cheerlead it, because it's the right thing to do.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, and good luck.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Good luck to you, too.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, and congratulations on a strong first quarter at the new Chubb. I just wanted to drill down on the expense savings. How much do you expect to drop to the bottom line? My sense is legacy Chubb was somewhat underinvested in, so are the expense savings net of any reinvestment, or how much could that be?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. We haven't figured in \u2013 that's not net of reinvestment. And Sarah, you have a natural growth \u2013 I'm not going to give you any point estimate number. You have a \u2013 but I'll give you a way I think about it, and \u2013 two ways. One, you have a natural growth rate of expenses based on your invested base of businesses, and you can see that, you see how ACE has been disciplined in expense and Chubb was disciplined in expense. So the overall organization is disciplined that way.","You then have some investments you make in new businesses. So, small commercial, as an example, or maybe you're expanding your cyber business or other businesses, and those will take investments. And then on the other side of the coin, we're \u2013 if we talk about legacy Chubb as being starved in some ways \u2013 and I think that's right \u2013 on one hand, it's technology. And so you invest in technology, but there you have a cash spend, but you then capitalize and amortize over many years. So that impact will not be, as you would imagine, sort of $1 of expense and $1 drops to the bottom. But you got a cash flow, and then you have an amortization of it. So those are what draws away from expense saved. And from the direct \u2013 coming directly all to the bottom.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then on the reserve...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I didn't help you worksheet manage it that much better, I got it. But we each live in our own hell.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, no. That's helpful insight, though. And then on the reserve releases, that was higher than I would have expected. Could you just talk about the difference...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What did you expect?","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","A little bit lower than the pro forma year-ago.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","How did you do your number?","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It was not that scientific, I will tell you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I thought so. I'm sorry, I just had to do that. It was like, well, what do you think, how'd you do it?","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","More directional. But could you just elaborate, are there differences between the reserve processes at legacy Chubb and legacy ACE? For example, does one company let the reserves season for longer, or does one company take them down quicker, historically?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, there was \u2013 the one thing I'm going to say, and then I'm going to ask a colleague of mine to give you a little more insight into it, there was not a change in reserving process, the way of thinking about reserve at either legacy Chubb or legacy ACE, that produced this. There was consistency. And I'm going to ask Sean Ringsted to now just give you a little more.","Sean Ringsted - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer & Chief Actuary, Chubb, Ltd.","Morning, Sarah. I think, just by way of background, as we went into the integration we found a lot of similarities between the companies, as opposed to differences, and the differences are very much at the margin. Both companies have robust processes, we've got really good teams of actuaries and good control environments, and the methods and the assumptions in the reserving methodology are pretty consistent across like products. And I think too, and you've heard Evan emphasize this on prior calls, we \u2013 both legacy companies have a conservative approach, especially to long-tail casualty lines.","There are some differences, I'd put those at the margin. Clearly, our process in terms of timing and frequency of studies would be different, our reserving platforms are different, but we're working to converge those processes and expect to have that done in 2017. So I think you'll find far more similarities in the respective processes, and we're going to enjoy continuing those in the future.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President - Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.","Thank you. And we have time for just one more person to ask questions, please.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our final question from Jay Cohen of Bank of America.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Just two questions, I think they're relatively quick. First for Phil, the interest expense on an ongoing basis, where will that land?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's in our interest expense in the corporate segment.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, I mean what's the number? Is the first quarter a good number to use going forward?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is. It's a complete number. All right, you know what...","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...I would do \u2013 there's 14 days of the interest expense that we didn't put into operating income, so I would just gross that up, the one-sixth of the quarter that wasn't there.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's what I figured, I wanted to check that. Thank you. And then secondly, on the investment income, the pick-up you talked about, what changes to the portfolio are you making to achieve that higher run-rate of investment income?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we've had extensive discussions with our outside managers who have a real deep expertise in asset allocation and municipal and corporate credit research, and our analysis shows that we can restructure the portfolio within securities and sectors that enhance the yield and diversify the holdings. And I just want to re-emphasize that those actions are not going to alter the risk profile of the portfolio, we'll keep the overall credit rating at AA.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Phil, is part of the benefit that Chubb had a big muni portfolio? The tax structure of the overall company, was it a bit different? Can that be restructured a bit, or is that really not...","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think...","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","...part of the game plan?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...over time, I think we can more actively manage the municipal portfolio, but that'll take time, as a lot of that is long-dated. So that's certainly part of it, to change from a really high-rated long-term hold strategy to more active management in the muni portfolio. But not...","Unknown Speaker","Your question was, as a percentage of the total portfolio.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We don't expect that to change.","Unknown Speaker","Right.","Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks for the answers.","Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President - Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you, and good day.","Operator","This concludes today's presentation.

Today's call is being recorded.","Before we begin, Chubb has asked me to make the following statements. In order to help you understand Chubb, its industry and its results, members of Chubb's management team will include in today's presentation forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","It is possible that actual results might differ from estimates and forecasts that Chubb's management team makes today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such differences appears in Chubb's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In the prepared remarks and responses to questions during today's presentation, Chubb's management may refer to financial measures that are not derived from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP.","Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related information, is provided in the press release and the financial supplement for the fourth quarter 2012, which are available on the Investors section of Chubb's website at www.chubb.com.","Please also note that no portion of this conference call may be reproduced or rebroadcast in any form without the prior written consent of Chubb. Replays of this webcast will be available through February 28, 2013. Those listening after January 31, 2013, should please note that the information and forecasts provided in this recording will not necessarily be updated and it is possible that the information will no longer be current.","Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Finnegan.","John D. Finnegan","Thank you for joining us. For Chubb and the P&C industry, the big story for the fourth quarter of 2012 certainly was storm Sandy, which resulted in tragic loss of life, human suffering and devastating damage to residential and commercial property across a large, densely populated region of the country.","Although Sandy generated, by far, the largest number of claims of any catastrophe in Chubb history, our people rose to the challenge, bringing empathy and moral support, along with tangible help, to thousands of people in distress, at a time when many of our employees were affected by the storm in the same way as our customers.","Sandy had a huge financial impact on Chubb as well, $882 million before tax, the largest net impact of any catastrophe in the history of Chubb. Nevertheless, we were able to produce an operating profit in the quarter. We achieved this by continuing to do the things we've discussed in recent quarters, expanding our margins through the pursuit of renewal rate increases, writing new business only when we believe we are securing adequate rates, and continually refining our risk selection to improve the profitability of our book of business.","So while our combined ratio for the fourth quarter was at 111.2%, including the 29.7 point impact of catastrophes, on an x cat basis the combined ratio was 81.5%. This was an 8 point improvement over the corresponding quarter of 2011 and the second best quarterly x cat combined ratio we've achieved over the past 5 years. It was a clear demonstration of the strong underlying performance of our business units.","Fourth quarter operating income per share was $0.16 and net income per share was $0.38, while the impact of catastrophes for the quarter was $2.13 per share. Premiums worldwide for the quarter were down 2%, although they were up about 1% excluding the effects of reinsurance reinstatement premiums related to Sandy and foreign currency translations.","In the U.S., we continue to secure renewal rate increases in all 3 of our business units, at or above the levels of the last few quarters. Rates were up 8% for Commercial, 9% for Professional Liability and renewal change was up 6% for Personal lines. In countries outside the U.S., which accounted for 27% of our total net written premiums, we secured rate increases in the low single digits.","During the fourth quarter, we also had favorable x cat loss experience reflecting the impact of our underwriting initiatives and we had some good luck in the form of lower non-cat related weather losses. Cat book value per share at year end was $60.45, up 8% compared to year end 2011.","Our capital position is strong, as evidenced by the new share repurchase program we announced today. As you saw in our press release, we provided operating income per share guidance for 2013 of $6.40 to $6.80.","Ricky will provide some more detail in guidance as well as our capital management activities.","And now I'll turn it over to Paul.","Paul J. Krump","Thanks, John. The Chubb Commercial Insurance net written premiums for the fourth quarter declined 2% to $1.2 billion. Excluding the $28 million impact of reinsurance reinstatement premiums related to storm Sandy, CCI's quarterly premium growth was flat.","CCI's quarterly combined ratio was 118.7% versus 93.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding the 36.8 point impact of catastrophes, CCI's fourth quarter combined ratio improved 11.7 points to 81.9% from 93.6% in the fourth quarter of 2011,  due to the disciplined risk selection and the compounding effect of overall rate increases. We are pleased that CCI's average U.S. renewal rates were up 8% in the quarter. This is identical to the average rate increases we obtained in the third quarter, as well as the average for all of 2012. The 8% increase in the fourth quarter of 2012 is on top of the 6% average renewal rate increase in the fourth quarter of 2011. So we are obtaining rate on rate.","In the fourth quarter, CCI secured average renewal rate increases in the United States in every line of business. Increases by line were in a fairly tight range around the overall average, led by workers compensation, general liability and Monoline property. We received rate increases on 90% of the renewal book compared to 70% in the fourth quarter of 2011.","In CCI markets outside of the U.S., average renewal rate increases were in the low single digits and generally varied little by country. CCI's fourth quarter U.S. renewal retention was 83%, down 1 point from the third quarter. The new-to-lost business ratio in the U.S. was 0.7:1 in the fourth quarter, down from 0.9:1 in the third quarter. New business can be choppy on a quarter-to-quarter basis. That being said, given the extent that new business was under-performing renewals, we implemented underwriting actions in the areas of risk selection and pricing in order to narrow that profitability gap, at the expense of some growth. I believe CCI's outstanding x cat performance demonstrates the success of these actions.","Midterm endorsement volume in the fourth quarter of 2012 was down relative to the fourth quarter of 2011. Audit premiums were flat. In the Northeast, activity in the property market for the quarter was driven by the effects of storm Sandy. Prior to the storm, there was some easing of rate increases in cat-prone areas. While it is too soon to tell the full effect of Sandy on the market, the storm has generally stemmed this dynamic in the Northeast property market, especially for the more cat-exposed locations.","For the full year, CCI's net written premiums increased 2% to $5.2 billion. The combined ratio was 99% in 2012 and 99.3% in 2011. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 11.4 percentage points in 2012 compared to 10.5 points in 2011. Excluding the impact of cats, CCI's combined ratio improved to 87.6% in 2012 from 88.8% in 2011.","Turning to Chubb's Specialty Insurance, net written premiums declined 7% in the fourth quarter to $688 million. The combined ratio improved to 88.5% from 89.8% in the fourth quarter of 2011. For the Professional Liability portion of CSI, net written premiums were down 5% to $613 million and the combined ratio improved to 93.7% from 96.1% in the fourth quarter of 2011.","We are encouraged that average renewal rates for Professional Liability in the U.S. increased by 9% in the fourth quarter of 2012, continuing the positive rate momentum that began in the fourth quarter of 2011. The 9% average renewal rate increase obtained in the fourth quarter compares to 8% in the third quarter and 1% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Like CCI, Professional Liability is now achieving rate increases on top of rate increases.","Each of our Professional Liability lines of business in the United States experienced renewal rate increases in the fourth quarter. Increases were led by private company D&O, EPL, public D&O and not-for-profit D&O. All 4 of these lines achieved low double-digit renewal rate increases. The crime, fiduciary and E&O lines obtained average renewal rate increases in the mid-single digits.","In markets outside of the U.S., renewal rate increases for Professional Liability in the fourth quarter were consistent with the third quarter, rising modestly by low single digits on average. Renewal premium retention for Professional Liability in the fourth quarter was 81% in the U.S., down 1 point from the third quarter. In order to improve the profitability of the book, we continue to differentiate our push for rate based on many factors, including segment, jurisdiction and individual account.","The new-to-lost business ratio for professional liability in the U.S. in the fourth quarter was 0.6:1, the same as in the third quarter of 2012.","Regarding the surety portion of our CSI book, net written premiums in the fourth quarter were down 15% to $75 million and the combined ratio was 51.4%. For the full year 2012, CSI net written premiums declined 6% to $2.6 billion and the combined ratio was 91.3% compared to 85.1% in 2011. Professional Liability premiums declined 5% to $2.3 billion and the combined ratio was 96.7%. Surety premiums declined 11% to $295 million and the combined ratio was 51.4%.","And with that, I will turn it over to Dino, who will review our Personal lines results as well as corporate-wide claims.","Dino E. Robusto","Thanks, Paul, and good evening, everyone. Chubb's Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 2% in the fourth quarter to $1 billion. Excluding a $25 million reinstatement premium related to storm Sandy, CPI's premiums grew 5% in the quarter. CPI produced a combined ratio of 117.9% compared to 86.9% in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes for the quarter was 40.1 percentage points in 2012, whereas in the fourth quarter of 2011, the impact of cats was 1.6 points.","CPI's x cat combined ratio for the quarter improved 7.5 points to 77.8% in 2012 from 85.3% in 2011.","Homeowners premiums were up 1% for the quarter and were up to 6%, excluding reinstatement premiums. The homeowners combined ratio was 131.3% compared to 82.3% in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of cats accounted for 62 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 2.8 points in the fourth quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the homeowners combined ratio was 69.3% compared to 79.5% in the corresponding quarter last year. This 10.2 point improvement is largely attributable to lower non-cat weather-related losses in the U.S., as well as higher rates.","In terms of homeowners policy retention, it remained steady in the United States with the third quarter at 91%. Homeowners new business premiums worldwide were up 8% over the fourth quarter of 2011.","Personal auto premiums for the fourth quarter increased 4% and the combined ratio was 97.1% including a 9.3 point impact from Sandy. On an x cat basis, the fourth quarter personal auto combined ratio improved 6.7 points to 87.8% from 94.5% in the same period, 2011, reflecting strong profitability across all jurisdictions.","Personal auto policy retention in the U.S. was also consistent with the third quarter of 2012 at 89%. New business premiums worldwide were up 8% over the fourth quarter of 2011, driven by strong growth in Brazil and Europe.","In other Personal lines, premiums were up 3% and the combined ratio was 97.1%, including a 2.7 point impact of cats, largely from our yacht business.","On an x cat basis, the other personal combined ratio of 94.4% is consistent with the 2012 full year result of 94.9% and the fourth quarter 2011 result of 94.2%.","Turning now to full year results. CPI's net written premiums in 2012 increased 4% to $4.1 billion. CPI produced a combined ratio of 94.4% including a 13.7 point impact of catastrophes, compared to a combined ratio of 98.3% including a 13.1 points of catastrophes in 2011.","Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CPI's combined ratio for the full year improved 4.5 points to 80.7% in 2012 from 85.2% in 2011. For all of 2012, homeowners premiums were up 3%, or 4% excluding reinstatement premiums. The homeowners combined ratio was 94.2% including a 21 point impact from catastrophes, compared to a combined ratio of 100.2% in 2011, including a similar impact from catastrophes of 20.6 points. Thus, the 6 point improvement in the combined ratio for the year was attributable almost entirely to the improvement in the underlying x cat performance.","Personal auto premiums increased 1% in 2012 to $691 million and the combined ratio was 93.4%. Other Personal lines premiums for the full year rose 8% to $880 million and the combined ratio of 95.6%. It's noteworthy that, even with the occurrence of a geographically immense storm that struck a densely populated and highly important area for Chubb, our homeowners business still produced nearly 6 points of underwriting profit for the year.","But as we think about storm Sandy within the context of the last several years of increasing weather-related losses, we recognize the need for additional price increases. Prior to Sandy, we had been implementing mid single-digit rate increases for homeowners in the Northeast. Post Sandy, we plan to file for rate increases up to the low teens in some areas of the Northeast.","Let me turn now to discuss claims for Chubb, overall. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 9.6 percentage points of the combined ratio for the full year 2012 and 29.7 points in the fourth quarter. The impact of catastrophes in the fourth quarter of 2012 was $876 million before tax, reflecting the $882 million net impact of Sandy, less $6 million of favorable reserve development from earlier periods. $4 million of that was from events earlier in 2012 and $2 million was from events prior to 2012.","Sandy was the largest catastrophe in Chubb's history, both in terms of the number of claims and the cost on a net of reinsurance basis. While Sandy affected 16 states and several Canadian provinces, about 90% of our claims originated in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. Roughly 53% of our loss was attributable to Commercial accounts and 47% to Personal Insurance customers. I'm proud to say that our claim teams, along with hundreds of other Chubb employees who helped out, turned in an outstanding performance, despite the large volume of claims and some unique challenges they faced, such as gasoline shortages, lengthy power outages, the inability to gain access to some affected areas due to flooding and closed roadways and, in some cases, dealing with the impact on their own homes.","Despite these handicaps, our customer survey feedback on closed claims for homeowners and personal auto customers currently indicates nearly a 98% highly satisfied rating, which is the highest rating on the survey form.","Catastrophes like Sandy are terrible events which take lives and cause massive disruption to survivors. But times like this also reinforce for our customers and their neighbors and friends, that there is a Chubb difference, one that is manifested in the speed, empathy and fairness with which we handle claims.","And now, I'll turn it over to Ricky who will review our financial results in more detail.","Richard G. Spiro","Thanks, Dino. Let me begin by pointing out that we have included some additional detailed information about the impact of storm Sandy, including our estimated gross loss, in the supplementary investment information, which can be found on our website.","Now, turning to our fourth quarter operating results. We had an underwriting loss of $332 million in the quarter due to the impact of Sandy. For the full year, underwriting income was $548 million. Property and Casualty investment income after tax was down 6% to $296 million in the quarter due, once again, to lower reinvestment rates in both our domestic and international fixed maturity portfolios.","Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter, due to net realized investment gains before tax of $90 million or $0.22 per share after tax. For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we had net realized investment losses before tax of $12 million or $0.03 per share after tax.","Unrealized depreciation before tax at December 31, 2012, was $3.1 billion. For comparison, unrealized depreciation before tax was $2.7 billion at year end 2011.","The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $44.2 billion as of December 31, 2012. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.6 years and the average credit rating is Aa3. This slight change in the average credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio this quarter from Aa2 is largely due to the fact that, on the margin, we have seen better total rate of return opportunities by purchasing select, high-quality corporate bonds over the past few years, as opposed to government mortgage-backed securities, due to the fed activity in the MBS sector. Our core investment strategy remains the same.","We also continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At December 31, 2012, our holding company portfolio had $2.6 billion of investments, including approximately $940 million of short-term investments. The increase in holding company liquidity from September 30, reflects the payment of a regularly scheduled dividend from the operating company to the holding company in December and the suspension of share repurchases for most of the quarter, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.","Book value per share under GAAP at December 31, 2012, was $60.45 compared to $56.15 at year end 2011, an increase of 8%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available for sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $53.80 compared to $50.37 at 2011 year end.","As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2012 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows. In CPI, we had approximately $40 million, CCI had $105 million, CSI, $50 million and reinsurance assumed $10 million, bringing the total favorable development to approximately $205 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the fourth quarter combined ratio of about 7 points over all.","For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we had about $185 million of favorable development for the company overall, including about $35 million in CPI, $90 million in CCI, $55 million in CSI and $5 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2011 was about 6 points.","For the fourth quarter of 2012, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 88.4% compared to 95.8% in last year's fourth quarter. This was our best quarterly x cat accident year combined ratio since 2007.","Favorable development for the full year 2012 totaled about $615 million and had a favorable impact on a combined ratio of approximately 5 points, compared to $765 million and a favorable impact of the combined ratio 6.5 points for 2011.","For the full year 2012, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 90.6% compared to 93% in 2011, an improvement of almost 2.5 points. During the fourth quarter, our loss reserves increased by $472 million, including an increase of $497 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $25 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff.","The impact of catastrophes increased reserves by about $520 million and the impact to currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in an increase in reserves of about $20 million.","Turning now to capital management. As we announced previously, in light of storm Sandy and the uncertainties surrounding it, after the storm, we temporarily suspended the repurchase of common stock under our share repurchase program, which we had announced in January of 2012 and which provided for the purchase of up to $1.2 billion of our common stock. We resumed repurchases under the program after the December 11, 2012, announcement of our estimated losses from Sandy. In total, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 369,900 shares at an aggregate cost of $28 million. The average cost of our repurchases was $76.54 per share. And for the full year 2012, we repurchased 13.1 million shares at an aggregate cost of $935 million and an average cost of $71.38 per share.","In January 2013, we repurchased an additional 1.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $108 million and an average cost of $78.77. That brings the total repurchases under the January 2012 repurchase program to $979 million.","As we had anticipated in our previous disclosure, as a result of the temporary suspension of repurchases related to Sandy, our total repurchases under the January 2012 program are below the $1.2 billion in repurchases we had previously contemplated completing by the end of this month.","As we announced today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1.3 billion share repurchase program, which replaces our prior program. Our 2013 guidance assumes that our repurchases during the calendar year will be roughly equal to expected operating income for 2013, less shareholder dividends. We intend to complete this new repurchase program by the end of January 2014, subject to market conditions and other factors.","Finally, before I turn it back to John, let me make a few additional comments regarding our guidance. We expect operating income per share for 2013 to be in the range of $6.40 to $6.80, which, at the midpoint, is $1.37 higher than our actual operating income per share for 2012. This guidance is based on our expectation that, for the full year 2013, net written premium growth will be 2% to 4%; we assume a continuation of current exchange rates resulting in no currency impact; we will have a combined ratio of 89 to 91; Property & Casualty investment income after tax will decline 7% to 9%.","As a reminder, unlike some of our competitors, we do not include our share of the change in the net equity of our alternative investments and Property & Casualty investment income. We include it in net realized investment gains and losses. And our guidance assumes 260 million average diluted shares outstanding.","Our guidance also assumes 4 percentage points of catastrophe losses. This has been adjusted upward by 0.5 points from last year's initial guidance, to reflect the higher cat losses that we have experienced recently. The 4 points is also consistent with our median annual catastrophe impact over the last 10 years.","In terms of sensitivity, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on 2013 operating income per share is approximately $0.30.","And now I'll turn it back to John.","John D. Finnegan","Thanks, Ricky. Chubb performed well in 2012 despite the historic catastrophe losses from Sandy. Here are some of the highlights.","For the fourth quarter, we were profitable despite Sandy. For the full year 2012, net income was $1.5 billion generating an ROE of 9.9%. Operating income per share for the year was $5.23 despite a $2.73 per share impact of catastrophes. Operating ROE for the year was 10.3%. These are strong results given the impact of catastrophes and the continued low interest rate environment.","Our 2012 x cat combined ratio was 85.7%. Our x cat accident year combined ratio was 90.6% for 2012. Renewal rates improved in all 3 SBUs, with the average U.S. rate increases for the full year of 8% for Commercial and 7% for Professional Liability and average U.S. renewal increases of 5% for Personal lines. Book value per share was up 8% for the full year.","We continued to actively manage our capital in 2012 by returning almost $1.4 billion to our shareholders, through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.","From the time our share repurchases began in December 2005 through the end of 2012, we have bought back 47% of our, then, outstanding shares. During that period, we have returned a total of $13.9 billion to our shareholders through $10.6 billion of share repurchases and $3.3 billion of dividends.","Our continued commitment to capital management is demonstrated by the new $1.3 billion share repurchase program we announced today.","To sum up, 2012 was a year in which nominal results were somewhat disappointing due to the impact of storm Sandy. However, these outsized catastrophe losses masked strong underwriting performance, which allowed us to still make a profit in the fourth quarter and generate $1.5 billion of net income for the full calendar year. The strong underlying performance reflects the impact of both higher rates and favorable loss experience, especially in the fourth quarter when we posted our best x cat accident year combined ratio since 2007.","In terms of losses, we had favorable experience throughout 2012, after experiencing an uptick in losses in the second half of 2011. This was due in good part to the myriad of underwriting initiatives we undertook in late 2011, aimed at improving our profitability even at the expense of growth.","However, while I would like to take credit for all the improved loss experience which subsequently occurred in 2012, the fact is that some of it was merely due to good fortune. For example, non-cat related weather losses in homeowners in 2012 were 3 points below our longer-term historical experience. A similar, albeit smaller, positive non-cat related weather impact was experienced in CCI related to our property business.","We believe it will be unduly optimistic to expect a recurrence of these unusually low non-cat related weather losses in 2013.","Looking ahead, we expect to see continued rate increases in 2013, which, on top of 2012 rate increases, should improve our accident year margins. On the other hand, we expect some of this benefit to be offset by what we assume will be a reversion to more normalized levels of non-cat related weather losses in 2013. We also expect headwinds in the form of lower investment income in 2013, due to continued low interest rates.","On balance however, we're optimistic going into 2013, as evidenced by our $6.40 to $6.80 per share operating income guidance. Achievement of earnings at anywhere near the midpoint of this guidance would result in the highest calendar year earnings per share in our history.","While 2012 was a challenging year because of unusually high catastrophe losses, the rate underwriting initiatives we undertook last year have established a foundation for strong performance in 2013.","And with that, we're glad to open up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","My first question relates to the guidance and I'm sort of trying to reconcile the guidance for the price increases. Your guidance for 2013 is exactly similar to your initial guidance for 2012. I understand the new-to-loss business numbers and the retentions discussion. Why wouldn't it still be higher than what your guidance was for 2012? What's the additional component?","John D. Finnegan","This has been a subject -- this question of margin expansion and impact on earnings. It's been a subject of discussion in prior quarters, also the subject of discussion, I think, this quarter, with a number of our competitors. So let me talk a little bit about it. It might be a little lengthy, but it seems to be an issue on everyone's mind. First of all, when you're talking about rate increases, I assume you're talking about prospective margin expansion, which is the impact on 2013 combined ratios from earned rate increases in excess of long-term loss trends. And then I guess, the follow-up question is, how do we reconcile this projected improvement in margins with our combined ratio guidance of 2013. So let's start with some facts. For 2013, we're estimating that earned rate increases will be about 3 points above long-term loss trends for the business as a whole, assuming renewal rates continue to increase at about 2012 levels. This compares the guidance for 2013, which implies an 85% to 87% x cat combined ratio, similar to the x cat ratio we ran in 2012. So, thus I suspect you're asking why our projected x cat combined ratio is an improvement by 3 points, in line with our pro forma margin expansion. So we got the question. The first thing I would say, that this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison. Margin expansion only applies to the business that is currently being earned, and which is reflected in current accident year results. In contrast, our combined ratio guidance is provided on a calendar year basis, which means that it's based on a variety of scenarios that includes both accident year results and potential prior period development. Such development, which could have a significant impact on year-over-year changes in combined ratios, is not affected by current rate increases. So as such, the appropriate comparison is how pro forma margin expansion compares with the projected year-over-year change in x cat accident year results. Since we do not provide expected development in our guidance, you have to make your own judgment on the x cat accident year combined ratio difference between 2012 and 2013. But it is this change in accident year x cat combined ratio, from 2012 to 2013, which should be -- form the basis of our comparison with our 3 point projected margin expansion, not the calendar year combined ratio given in our guidance. So, that's the starting point. You'd have to come up with an accident year and compare it there. But even in making the comparison on accident year, you should note that the 3 points by which earned rate increases are expected to exceed longer-term loss trends, they only translate into a similar improvement in x cat accident year combined ratios to the extent that actual, actual losses in 2013 track longer-term trends, both directionally [ph]  in 2013 and 2012. The practical matter, actual losses in a given year, frequently are a good deal above or below longer-term loss trends. So let me give you a clear illustration, fourth quarter 2012 results. We were at an x cat accident year combined ratio 7 points better than the fourth quarter of 2011. Over the same period, earned rate increases only exceeded longer-term loss trends by about 1 point. The remaining improvement for the fourth quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2012 reflected the difference in actual loss experience in each quarter, not longer-term trends. In the fourth quarter of 2011, you may recall, actual losses ran well above trend lines.  In fact, they were highest in recent memory, while actual loss experience reverted to below trend line levels in the fourth quarter of 2012. So to sum up, well, it's the actual experience not longer-term trend lines embedded in margin expansion calculations which accounted for most of the year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter of 2012. So for this recent [ph] and developing of 2013 projections, start by looking at the loss experience in 2012, the base year from which these projections are developed and the base year to which you're making the comparison. In this case, we enjoyed very benign x cat loss experience in 2012, well below longer-term trend lines. For example, in 2012, we benefited from a low to normal non-cat U.S. weather impact on homeowners of about 3.5 points versus a roughly 6 point average in the previous 5 years. So in developing our 2013 outlook, we assume some reversion to the mean in loss trends, especially related to a potential increase in losses from non-cat related weather to more historical experience levels. If this occurs, and there's no way of knowing with any degree of certainty whether it will, such higher non-cat related weather losses would be a partial offset to the positive impact of margin expansion on homeowners and commercial property classes of business. So the bottom line is that earned rate increase should exceed longer-term loss trends in 2013 and that's kind of the basis of your question. But you got to back out favorable development to make an apples-to-apples comparison. And even in the accident year, you cannot assume that margin expansion will convert into a dollar-for-dollar improvement in earnings from 2012, since actual loss levels last year were well below trend lines. Any actual accident year improvement will be a function of not only rate increases, but of changes in actual losses from 2012 to 2013, not longer-term trend lines.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Got it. That's very helpful. I guess, the only other question I have and I don't want to take up too much time is the discussion on capital management. If I look at your buyback for 2013 and if I back out the carried over number, the $221 million which was left from the last buyback, in some sense, your adjusted buyback for 2013 is $1.079 billion which is lower than the 2012 initial number of $1.2 billion? Am I sort of overdoing this math or is this a function of the stock price, why your adjusted buyback would be, in some senses, lower than the 2012 buyback?","John D. Finnegan","I don't think it's lower. I think our projected buyback for 2013 is precisely on the level of expected income, operating income, less dividends. The reason you're having the $200 million jump is, while we had original buyback intentions in 2012 along the lines you suggested, we only bought back a little bit less than $1 billion in buybacks, which was by the way, ended up to be in line with operating income less dividends in 2012 too. So in both years, the expectation is we're buying back shares in the amount of operating income less dividends.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You mentioned 2 numbers in your semi-prepared remarks you just gave. The 3.5 versus the 6, is that a non-cat weather loss '12 versus '11, what was that exactly?","John D. Finnegan","It was non-cat weather loss '12 versus the 5-year -- versus the average of the prior 5 years. And I think in '11, it was a little bit higher, it's maybe 7 or something.","Richard G. Spiro","Yes. It was about 8.5.","John D. Finnegan","8.5, it's that high. But no, it's the prior 5 years.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And not to sound cheeky, but what is non-cat weather as sort of thinking about those kind of losses versus the normal going of things kind of losses?","John D. Finnegan","Non-cat related weather, it's like this time of year when your pipes freeze. It's not part of a catastrophe.","Dino E. Robusto","Not modeled.","John D. Finnegan","Like, remember 2011, we had all those storms. It wasn't a modeled catastrophe, but they had a tremendous amount of freezes, that kind of stuff.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So I guess there's like burglary and fires and, I guess, damage.","John D. Finnegan","Fire would be the other example of something that's not in that category.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So you have cat weather, you have non-cat weather and then everything else is generally not weather-related.","Richard G. Spiro","Right. that's right.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's excellent. And so just trying to understand if I'm -- and I don't think you're going to guide me completely on it. But of course, it's very impressive that you guys are back at 2007 margins for the quarter. In terms of -- can we go back to the 4Q '11 and talk about the impact of non-cat weather there, the impact of non-cat weather this quarter, margin improvements between the 2? I mean it's an amazing quarter, it's hard to digest the numbers.","John D. Finnegan","Listen, the improvement from fourth quarter 2011 was significant. It was 8 points. But 2011 was a miserable quarter and it was the worst x cat accident year quarter we can find in recent history. So we can't brag about improvement from 2011, that was awful. But on the other hand, 2012 was the second best x cat accident year -- it was the best x cat accident we've seen in 5 years. I mean, as I talked about, 8 points, 1 was favorable development, 7 points were accident year. It was the difference in actual losses from very bad to very good. I mean, yes, non-cat related weather was a difference, but not in anywhere near, I mean, explaining 7 points from the overall business. I mean, it could amount to 1 point or 2. Because remember we're comparing -- when we're talking 3.5 to 6 and 7, we're talking in the homeowners line. The impact at the corporate level, the overall x cat accident year is diluted to more like 1 point, if you average that out. So it's more important when you relate it to 2012 to 2011 calendar year and when we look at 2013 versus 2012. Fourth quarter versus fourth quarter was a great quarter versus a lousy quarter. Non-cat related weather was not a big player in that.","Operator","We'll take next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question was on the non-cat weather benefit. You provided information on the homeowners. If you could also provide information on the CCI. You said on the commercial property business last year was a good year. So what's the benefit for that?","Paul J. Krump","This is Paul, Vinnie. Non-cat weather in Commercial is a little bit different. There, were really talking like a big fire. Occasionally, you'll get like a tornado that will come and land on a commercial facility. But what we're really talking about are things that are not modeled cats and get a cat designation. So we have had experiences before where Chubb might get hit by a tornado that doesn't really affect other people. But we just didn't have any of that in the last quarter.","John D. Finnegan","The impact is far less in Commercial, of course, than it is in homeowners. It's higher.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","All right. For the year -- how much of a benefit do you think that actually gave to Chubb for the year within that line?","John D. Finnegan","I mean, it depends what you want to revert it to, versus 2000 and -- if you take -- let's make it simple, if you took 3.5 points versus 8.5 points, you'll be comparing 2012 to 2011. That's 5 points on a business that's maybe 30% of our business, right? So you're talking 1.5 points or something like that. If you compare it to historical 5-year average, is you're talking 3 points, I think 30% of our business, it's worth a point.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So it's roughly about 3 points better than the historical average? Okay, that's helpful.","John D. Finnegan","But again, in the homeowners line, it gets diluted when you roll it over the whole corporate consolidated numbers.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Right. Fair enough. The second question was on the retentions and new business. Now, you guys have done a great job of sort of pulling back on new business. But your retentions awards [ph]  have fallen. Just curious about management's willingness to let the retention remain low and to let the new business remain low, and to continue rate increases this year versus last year.","John D. Finnegan","Those are 2 different questions. I mean retention, that's not that low. I mean, I think that Personal Lines at 90 is as good as you're going to get, better than anybody in the industry. Commercial and Professional Liability in the low 80s is right up there with any of our competitors. I mean they all report it different ways, it depends if you want to put renewal price increases in the retention base, we don't. So we think it's as good as any. We haven't -- this quarter, the Commercial business in the U.S. was 83%. That's down 1 point from the third quarter and the same as the first quarter of this year. So not a significant decline, especially since we've undertaken -- we, earlier this year undertook some triage in some areas of the business. Professional Liability of 81, 82, was down at 1 point again. Now, this is a barrier where we've had more loss in market share and retention and this is over a course of 2 years. But that was the focus of our attention, we're running over 100 combined ratio. We focused on either getting substantial -- Medicaid is just culling weaker performing accounts, and I think we've given you statistics on that in the last call. And then others, just needing rate increases that we don't get, get it off the accounts. I mean, when you're earning 102, 103 on average, you must be running 110 and 120 in certain sectors in certain customers. So there's no reason to be in that business. So it comes down to, there's no bright lines across the board. We're okay with retention as it is. We look at the economics of the business by segment and account in order to determine the price. And in certain areas of Professional Liability, we just have to get off if we don't get rate. Commercial now is becoming more profitable, sometimes the trade off is a little more difficult in there. But we focus more on retention in the case of our highest ranked accounts, reflecting the superior economics of this business.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Just one last question. Your premium to surpluses are really low. Just wondering if you have any desire to take out the excess capital from the subsidiary level.","Richard G. Spiro","Our premium surplus ratio, I think, is at 0.84:1. I think it's the same as it was last year and up a little bit from where it was the prior years. I think we're comfortable with where we are.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to look at the top line. It's the same guidance as last year, excellent trends on the pricing side, high single digits in many lines. Are you just assuming kind of -- sort of what are the embedded assumptions to get to the top line guidance that's the same year-over-year? I'm curious why it's not up.","Richard G. Spiro","Sure, Greg, it's Ricky. I'll take a shot at trying to put that in perspective. There are a lot of interrelated parts. Let me start, by the way, and say that for the full year 2012, forget about guidance from last year. But for the full year, actual growth in 2012, just to level set, net premiums were increased 1% and they were up 2% if you exclude the effect of foreign currency translations. So our 2% to 4% premium growth in 2013 is higher than last year. And we think that's pretty attractive growth rate given the continued global economic headwinds that we in the industry are facing. Having said that, though, why aren't we expecting to see more growth in 2013, given the higher rate environment? I think there are a number of interrelated factors here that need to be understood. And then I'll go through those relatively quickly and then maybe even give you a quick mathematical example to show you how it works. But first off, as we've mentioned in our earlier remarks, while we're seeing positive rate trends in most of our business lines and geographies, the amount of these rate increases vary significantly. And in particular, we're getting higher rate increases in the U.S. than we are outside the U.S. So bear in mind, 27% of our business comes from outside the U.S. and there, we're not getting the same high single-digit rate increases that we're getting here. So on a blended basis, the actual rate increase is a little bit lower. Second is, as John just talked about, as we continue to push for rate, we expect some trade-offs between retention and new business levels in 2013 and we've taken this into consideration in our guidance. And the reality is, it's this new-to-loss concept that has the biggest impact on why, if you're thinking about a high single-digit rate increase, it doesn't boil down to the bottom line of a similar number in terms of net premiums written and growth. And then last point I'll make, before I try to give you a quick example, given some of the economic headwinds that I just talked about, we're being realistic about some of the 2013 growth components, such as exposure, increases on items such as commercial properties, midterm endorsement activity in premium audits. So we believe that these trade-offs make sense in getting the right price terms and conditions for the risk we're writing and for our value proposition, is sort of in our DNA. Now for the example, and this isn't necessarily the numbers that will tie to our guidance, but just to give you some numbers that you can think about. So just for illustrative purposes, let's assume for a second that you get rate increases of 7%. And then let's assume that your retention is in the low 80s. I'll pick 83% for purposes of this example. So the impact, as I said earlier, our price on growth, only applies to the retained premium. So in this example, you're getting 7 points. It's applied to the 83% retention, which gives you about a 6-point improvement in growth. Then you've got to look to the new-to-loss business ratio. And for this purpose, let's assume it's 0.8:1. So on that basis, our lost business would exceed our new business by 3 to 4 points. And then, when you add the numbers up, you end up with growth somewhere in the 2 to 3 points of growth before any other adjustments. So even though we started at 7 points of rate increases, you don't get there when you get down to net premiums written.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. Very thorough. And so, I guess, embedded in the answer and the illustration, is that you're going to continue to, at the margin, choose pricing over new business and retention. That's just better for the economics of The Chubb Corporation based on what you see in the market.","John D. Finnegan","We don't expect any significant deterioration in retention and we expect new business to rise from fourth quarter levels. But we certainly don't expect to see it get back to one-to-one yet. Now if the pricing environment continues to improve, new business becomes more attractive. First, in Commercial, then eventually, in Professional Liability. But, I mean, it was 0.6 and 0.7 this quarter, we are not assuming it's going to be back for the full calendar year, next year, one-to-one.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then last one, just the topline is, you're not the only carrier to report that the international pricing environment is sort of lackluster compared to the U.S. pricing environment. I mean, Ace and Travelers cited the same. Why do you guys think that is? Why is it so difficult to push price outside the U.S., in the P&C markets, versus what's happening in our country?","Paul J. Krump","You want me to try take a stab at that -- Greg, I think, again it's kind of broad, the whole globe outside of the United States. Obviously, it's been much easier in a place like Chile and Australia and Japan that have experienced some terrible catastrophes. But there are parts of the world that are less cat prone than the East Coast of the United States. I think that it really just comes down to all the laws of supply and demand, there's still some excess capital out there. And I think some of the underwriters are just less disciplined, from my experiences, than in the United States.","John D. Finnegan","But that being said, the combined ratios overseas over the last few years have run pretty well in line with the U.S. So it hasn't proved to be a less profitable area.","Paul J. Krump","Not for us.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Favorable development of roughly $500 million for 2012. If you had to ballpark, how much of that is pre-2007 and how much of that is post 2007?","John D. Finnegan","All right, well, let's see. I'll give you --  we'll give you -- we have a breakdown. We won't break it out by dollars, but give you an idea. The answer is, most of it came from the years 2006 through 2009.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then reserved -- favorable development, still at a good level, but it's come down from 2010, 2011 levels. Trying to predict is very tough. But if you could just give us your gut feeling right now, for 2013, are we around the same? Do you think potentially for more or less?","John D. Finnegan","I said for years that our level of favorable development, which was 6 to 7 points, would be unsustainable. I wasn't right for most of those years, and it stayed at 6, which by the way wasn't -- if you're going to make an error, it's good when it works in your favor. Now in 2012, we sort of declined for the first time, with development falling a little over 1 point to 5 points. But it's difficult to predict and it's lumpy because, while it's settled to 5 points for the year, it jumped up to 7 points for the quarter. So it's a function of loss cost trends. I mean, I believe, over time, if someone predicts that development should be -- it can't be 5 points on a going-forward basis, indefinitely. I'd probably have to agree to them. But I don't know where it's going to be in 2013 and we run the guidance at a variety of scenarios, different mixes for accident year and development. So I can't tell, I think over the longer term you'd expect to get less. But we haven't seen much of that and we got a surprise from the fourth quarter of 2012.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And one last question, casualty loss trend, I'm guessing is still pretty benign. What do you think is driving that and what could change that? Or what are you worried about as you look over the next couple of years?","Paul J. Krump","Well, we worry about emerging hazards. We try to track those as best as we possibly can. We worry about changes in laws. We track those very carefully. We -- obviously, medical inflation is something that we worry about on both a GL and a work comp perspective. So those are the 3 broad categories that we keep a very close eye on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A follow-up on capital managements. Can you comment on the plans for other items, such as the debt coming due in April, pension and capital for growth initiatives? And then I have one follow-up.","Richard G. Spiro","Sure. Let me start with a debt. We have $275 million of senior notes that mature in April. We have not made any decision yet regarding whether or not to refinance our maturing debt. I'll point out that we believe we have a lot of financial flexibility to deal with the maturity. And particularly, we have lots of liquidity at the holding company, should we decide to simply pay it down as we did with our last maturity in 2011. And at the same time, we're very comfortable with our current leverage ratios and believe we have open access to the capital markets if we want to refinance at today's attractive levels. However, at this time, it would be premature to comment on our specific intentions. So lots of flexibility, it's only a $275 million maturity. We have plenty of options. I'll also point out, our next maturity after this isn't until 2018. So we've got a long way in between. In terms of the pension, we've been making our normal contributions to the pension and we made normal contributions during the year. We did have a negative hit in terms of equity in the fourth quarter, given where interest rates were at the end of the year. And I think it was about $70 million or so in terms of the hit in the fourth quarter. But other than that, nothing that I'd particularly highlight, as it relates to the pension. And then in terms of capital for growth initiatives, we continue to believe that we are in a strong excess capital position, based on both our internal assessment and rating agency models. And we believe that we have plenty of capital to support any growth that we see coming down the pike, as well as to support our share buyback and other initiatives. So we feel very good about our capital position.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then lastly, so double-digit homeowners price increases were cited in the Northeast. Any changes to terms and conditions? And what about the same items on the Commercial side in the Northeast?","Dino E. Robusto","Whenever you get an event as large as Sandy, it's always going to bring some adjustments to our underwriting, clearly to the pricing, as was just indicated. We always do an after-action review with our claims, look at what we found. I think we'll see some narrowing of our underwriting appetite in some coastal areas, based on the state of beaches and the infrastructure available to access certain towns. We'll probably avoid certain construction characteristics that we thought were compromising the ability for these structures to withstand the effects of Sandy. We -- the FEMA recently released a new flood map through New Jersey and Long Island, and that will probably continue to contract some of our appetite. We're going to continue to encourage our customers to select higher all-peril deductibles. We're fortunate we have -- about 40% of our book has got deductibles of 5,000 or higher. We'd love to see that in more than half of our book. And I think, in addition to Sandy, the weather events, really throughout 2011, generated some significant home repair and rebuilding. So, we, in turn, increase our construction cost adjustment factors to reflect these new alterations and this is going to result in some higher exposure changes at renewal that offset some underlying loss cost trends. And then of course, with all of the elevated cap activity and non-weather activity, we just have to continue to push those prices. And clearly, we're going to do that in some places in the Northeast, as I indicated earlier.","Paul J. Krump","On the Commercial side, similar to what Dino just articulated, we push ourselves very hard to continually improve. Dino touched on this after-action review. We do the exact same thing commercially after every big loss, every cat. And I would say that, from Sandy, we have learned a handful of things and we'll be implementing lessons. For the team at CCI, those range from everything from non-renewing a few commercial customers who were hit with flood claims in both Irene and Sandy, and that we just don't believe -- and after speaking with them, they can't, or won't implement some loss control measures to make us more comfortable moving forward. We're altering some of our flood aggregations down to a neighborhood level, business districts. And we've tightened some of the underwriting referrals for those specific locations as well.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","What about pricing on the Commercial side? Is Sandy having a big impact on those areas?","Paul J. Krump","I would tell you that one of the things, I guess, just to point out, is that, you may not know this, but New York State has a moratorium in place in and around much of greater New York City. That's a restriction for all insurance companies, not just Chubb. So our ability to non-renew customers, change terms and conditions, or charge a renewal rate increase greater than 9.9%, right now, is hampered. And for all intents and purposes, that will be throughout the first quarter. So I think we're getting kind of a cloudy view of what will exactly happen to rates post Sandy, just because we're primarily a big writer in and around New York City, commercially.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Gelb of Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I had just a few quick ones. What was the gross losses for Sandy?","Richard G. Spiro","The gross loss, which as I mentioned, by the way, in my comments, you can find that in our supplemental information, I think it's Page 6. It was $1.1 billion.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then next, on the outlook for after-tax net investment income being down 7% to 9% in 2013. It was down 6% in 2012. So I'm just trying to get a sense of why you feel that decline could accelerate this year.","Richard G. Spiro","Well, it's a combination of things related to maturities, investable cash flows. There's been further declines in interest rates and it's just a combination of all those factors. So we think 7% and 9% is the number for 2013. I would point out though, assuming rates stay where they are, we also would expect to see declines in investment income in the years following, at least, the next couple of years following 2013, although we'd expect the rate of decline, or the percentage decline, to be a little bit narrow or smaller, given that the portfolio would've had a few years to run and we would've had a lower overall book yield on the portfolio by that time.","John D. Finnegan","It's driven by maturities. I think Ricky's pointed out in the past that we have about $15 billion in maturities over the 2012, '14 period.","Richard G. Spiro","Yes and we have about $13.5 billion in maturities, '13, '14, '15.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In total?","Richard G. Spiro","In total.","John D. Finnegan","In total, yes. It's pretty comparable by year. Obviously, the maturities -- the rates can go as low as you want, as long as the assets don't roll off. When they roll off, it hurts you more.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","We all understand that. On the -- for the yield, there was a 25 basis point decline in overall portfolio yield in 2012 versus 2011. Are you looking for a consistent decline in '13?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes. I don't know that I can give you a number that would be comparable to that. What I can tell you is, from where we sit today, I mean obviously, as I've said on prior calls, the reinvestment rates that we're getting today vary by asset class. But on average, across the portfolio today, we are reinvesting at about 200 basis points below our maturing book yields.","John D. Finnegan","I guess, Jay, at 25 points I'm talking $40 billion portfolio and your investment income is coming down $100 million. That's 25 points is probably -- somewhere -- in performance [ph]  math, somewhere close.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","$100 million after tax. Okay.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Josh Stirling at Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So if I could ask you a big picture question. So we're clearly seeing a cycle turn and companies are responding differently and you guys are obviously being disciplined, driving profitability, not chasing your business. So presumably that's a strategic choice. If we're trying to look at the market broadly, and Chubb specifically, how much more rate in re-underwriting do you think you're going to have to do before you'd seek to bring your new-to-loss business ratio back to 1:1? And just sort of more broadly, try to keep your shares stable?","John D. Finnegan","It depends on line of business. I mean, I would say that we're not -- in terms of rate adequacy, if you factor in, as one should, as we do here when we price, fully load cat loads in, and I mean it's -- we're not rate adequate in our cat exposed business areas. And we're certainly not rate adequate in Professional Liability. So we need rate increases to get rate adequate now. To the extent eventually, the market won't give it to us, we'll have to make a judgment on what we're willing to trade off. But we're happy with our retention levels as it is. We're happy -- we're very happy with our book. We had to get it fixed from 2011. I think it's -- generally, if you're going to get 1:1 in new business, you're going to have to write new business at higher combined ratios than you write retained business, renewed business. But if you're combined ratio on your renewed business is pretty good, like it's now becoming in Commercial and as it used to be, for a number of years, in a number of our businesses, that's okay. You don't mind having a few points higher in combined ratio on new business. But if you're running 100 to 105 in Professional Liability, you can't afford to be writing new business at 5 and 10 points higher. So, at each business line, it depends on the economics and we do the trade all the time and we do expect new-to-loss to be up from the fourth quarter levels, especially in Commercial, as the market improves in 2013.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's helpful. The final question I'd ask would be on the Professional Liability business. You guys commented last quarter, you saw improving trends broadly in some of the things that had surprised you. Has that led -- has that continued and led to you guys taking down like prior accident year quarters? And was that something that's going to continue to work for you in 2013?","John D. Finnegan","Well, we didn't -- I don't remember commenting on improving trends. We commented on the -- all the initiatives we had to undertake to try to get improving trends. Professional Liability is not the instant feedback loop you see in Commercial. I mean, you get such a small loss base for the -- the actions we started taking were as a result of year-end 2011. So most of these actions weren't even in place until halfway through 2012. Plus, one of the big actions was rate, and rates lagged in Professional Liability. And we're sure happy as heck that they came out at 9% in the fourth quarter. But for the year, earned premium was only -- was up less than 2%. So if anything, we had negative margin expansion during the year. We think that these actions will -- the fourth quarter this year was better than the rest of the year, but that's mostly expense ratio, seasonal stuff, and it's not really better than the fourth quarter -- it's better than the fourth quarter of last year, but the calendar year isn't better. We think it's going to take hold and if we get the kind of rate increases we're seeing in the marketplace now, it will start to improve. We think the -- culling our accounts will result in improvement. But the feedback loop is long for most of the lines. And unfortunately, in the lines where it's short, like crime, we've had an unfavorable experience and we're still bothered by EPL. But overall, I think these actions will get us back to where we used to write this on an accident year basis.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just trying to square a couple of comments. John, I think you mentioned about 3 points better x cat underlying like non-cat weather in 2012 versus trend. And then it looks like in Personal and Commercial lines, you're about 3 to 4, 2 to 3 points better year-over-year. But both have seen rate gains in mid- to high-single digits. So how much of the rate gains you've taken in '12 are in -- are already earned through, versus how much are not? And then just one follow-up.","John D. Finnegan","I could give you that, that's easy. In 2012, when you look at margin expansion, you're looking at earned rate increases versus long-term loss trends. And in CPI and CSI, we didn't have any margin expansion. And in CCI, we had a couple of points of margin expansion. And next year, we expect about 3 points of margin expansion, overall, from a corporate perspective. But again, I mean, margin expansion doesn't get through to the bottom line, it's actual loss experience that gets through in the bottom line. So we're starting off a benign 2012. So I'm not sure we're going to enjoy all of that expansion. Or stated another way, I'm not sure that the year-over-year losses will track the longer-term loss trends.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So that margin expansion will come through with long-term trends, if next year kind of matches up with your long-term trends?","John D. Finnegan","Absolutely. But it starts from a good base, I mean, so that's good. The fourth quarter -- in the fourth quarter, it was like flat in the 2 businesses and we had longer-term rate increases -- rate year [ph]  increases exceeded longer-term trend lines by about 2 points in CCI.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then when you look at, kind of, whether it's CCI or CSI, through the quarter and into January, was the trend kind of continuing upward, kind of flattish across the board?","John D. Finnegan","I think the market tone was pretty much the same throughout the quarter and it's remained about the same in January. Now rate increases, they change based on mix of business and longtime big accounts. So nominal rates aren't always the same, but within a point, either way. No, I see a couple of people commented that market improved in January from the fourth quarter and it may be true for them. But I note that they were -- those carriers were generating 4% rate increases in the fourth quarter versus our 8%. So if they started pushing -- we were leaders, they were lagging. If they started pushing for rate more, it's very possible they could have seen an improvement in January from the 4%. I doubt they're up to the 8%. And so we're both starting from a different environment. In the area we're in, I think that January looked -- December looked like the rest of the year. Fourth quarter in January looked like the fourth quarter.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right. And then just last quick one, if you look at your peer group, I mean, you have others calling from high-single digit rate, mid- to high-single in commercial. But very few people are showing the same level of rate improvement you are on the Professional Liability side. Do you find that you're kind of leading the charge more on CPI and that's why new business is down and premiums are down? Or what's your competitive position versus peers on the rate side?","John D. Finnegan","I think that -- listen, if you look at the numbers, I'd think you'd have to say that the market's tougher -- has been tougher in Professional Liability. I think -- because of the catastrophe losses, I think the foundation was there for improvements in Commercial. We saw significant improvement in rates in Commercial take place earlier. And Professional Liability was tough, and as we started pushing for rate early, we lost -- that's when we lost a good deal of business. Over the last 3 quarters, we haven't lost too much. I think, now, we believe the market has improved. We seen it in our numbers. And we see it in -- we see that in competitive numbers, that the ones that have come out show that there are some rate increases there too. And our people tell us that the market's more amenable to rate increases now in Professional Liability. I'm sure you're seeing people -- carriers suffering losses in areas like EPL, similar to what we are, and probably running a higher combined ratio. So, yes, I think Professional Liability has been tough. We've been saying that all along. But all of a sudden, it's picked up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann at JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question is just on the expense ratio this quarter. I was just curious if there was any reversal of incentive comp in the first 9 months.","John D. Finnegan","Good question. I'd say that -- I'll let these guys correct me. I think the answer is this, I think incentive comp probably improved the expense ratio by close to 1 point, but that was partially offset by about 0.5 point negative impact from reinstatement premiums in the quarter. So net-net, it was probably a -- it's probably 0.5 points -- really, you'd have to adjust it about 0.5 point to get the run rate, I think.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. The other question I had was just with respect to the agent feedback you're getting. I mean, my own conversations with agents and other surveys have done whatnot. There doesn't -- it doesn't seem like agents are having much time pushing prices through. I would assume you're seeing the same thing. But I guess, my question would be, when you think about why price increases might slow down at some point, do you think it's more likely to be because agents have a hard time pushing price increases to clients, or because companies will be more driven, let's say, algebraically by what they feel like the new business returns are. I guess I'm just curious, who will kind of blink first? Would a company like Chubb just try to push rates as far as they can push them, even if it means exceeding what you would think would kind of be a reasonable ROE? Or do you just kind of start to pull back the range yourself?","John D. Finnegan","Like you said, we're not price adequate in our overall business. We're price adequate in some lines, not price adequate in many, especially cat exposed area and Professional Liability. I'd just point out though too, when you get the price adequacy -- sometimes when a question comes, it sounds like price adequacy is a permanent state of mind. In truth, you get the price adequacy and we're not there yet. But when you get there, you got to get 4 or 5 points of rate to stay there. I mean, we've been talking a lot here about margin expansion and loss trends, and annual loss trends are about 4 points. And when you take into account the other thing we're talking about, with lower investment returns on rolled over money, maybe you need 5 points. So if I'm price adequate on January 1, 2014, I need 5 points the next year to remain price adequate, or I'm back to being price inadequate.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's fair. And then, just in terms of how you think about rates, because I've struggled with -- when you think about rates do you think about what the -- or versus kind of what the returns of the business are in rate adequacy, relative to where your reinvestment rate is, or relative to your portfolio yield?","John D. Finnegan","Reinvestment rate.","Richard G. Spiro","We measure the current reinvestment rates.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","When we look at the -- all lines, full year combined, x cat, combined ratio outside the United States, it's up by 300 basis points. Can you talk about whether that's mix or a loss trend issue?","John D. Finnegan","I think, overseas had performed extremely well for a number of years. I think we've got -- we've heard [ph]  some more losses. And over the last year, we've had to cut back in a few areas overseas because we picked up some new business that didn't perform well. We had several large losses, so some of it was maybe one-time. But also I think that -- I think, a couple -- I'll cut it down, so let's say 3 things. One, we're coming off a pretty good base over the last few years. Second, there were several large losses. Hopefully, it's not indicative of anything. And third, as we talked about, we haven't been getting any rate overseas. We're getting 2 or 3 points of rates. Ultimately, even in a benign loss environment, you disguise it for a while. But ultimately, as we found out in Professional Liability, if you don't get rate for a long period of time, you can eventually have margin contraction. And we've seen that, but less development. If you're measuring too -- points out that when you look at -- as we talked about before, between calendar year and accident year, when you look at the business you're writing, you're looking at accident year. In this case, a good deal under 300 points is less favorable development too. So it doesn't necessarily go to the business you're writing.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","No, that makes perfect sense. Are you planning on changing reinsurance buying at all? I know you ticked up the cat provision on what you're retaining.","Richard G. Spiro","We renew our major cat treaties in April and we'll update you on the impact of those renewals on the next call. But at this point, it's way too early to know just how we might be impacted by Sandy and what the market really looks like and how our weather, if at all, will modify our program. But if we make any changes, we'll certainly let you guys know on the next call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Cohen at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple other questions. The first is, the workers comp underwriting result was really quite good in the quarter and I'm wondering if there's anything unusual there or have claims eased up a bit in that line of business.","Paul J. Krump","It's a combination of a couple of things. A, we had a good quarter on a calendar year basis and we had a little bit of a prior period of favorable development. And we've been growing the line pretty well. It's basically been growing off of rate. As we've talked about, it's been a high rate class of business. So that's helped our expense ratio a little bit in the fourth quarter. So we're real pleased.","John D. Finnegan","Yes, expense ratio was probably a couple of points better than one would expect on a normalized basis. It's -- as Paul would call it, it's inside baseball, I mean, I don't know, it has something to do with all these adjustments of incentive compensation or reinstatement premiums, affect each line of business a little bit differently on the expense ratio side. And I'd say that it's probably 2 to 3 points inflated in terms of our performance there due to expense ratio. But even with that, it's a pretty darn good quarter and rate, rate, rate. It's counted a lot.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes -- no, that's helpful. And then the other topic, you don't really break it out too much, but the A&H business is not an insignificant line of business for you. The profitability of that line has been kind of up and down over the past 3 years. I'm wondering if you can give us an update there. What in 2012 would the profitability look like in any sense of what the premium contributions was.","Paul J. Krump","Yes, this is Paul, Jay. I mentioned in the past, the last couple of years we brought on an A&H team, and they've been revamping our book of business. They took out a couple of very unprofitable programs. So one of the things, if you're looking at the U.S. A&H numbers that are published, I would just point out, that's the bulk of where the culling so far has taken -- that took place. But those numbers haven't been that good. All up though, we've got a lot of plans for it to continue to grow and get more profitable. Right at this point in time, it is profitable, but not quite where we need it to be. But again we're growing it and changing the mix. About 75% of the business is overseas. So we don't give a specific number on it. It's in Personal lines other right now. But as it grows, we'll probably give you more on it over time.","Operator","And our final question today comes from Ian Gutterman at Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","I guess, 2 questions if I can. First, I think it was Paul who talked about new business in CCI being a little bit more conservative due to some, maybe negative performance on some of the new business you had. Can you expand on that? Because what's surprising about it is, I think over the last year, many of your competitors have said, very strongly, that the quality of new business is closer to renewal than it's ever been, and that frankly, new business have been very favorable. So you're kind of the first ones to say something a little different. I was wondering if you can provide some more color.","Paul J. Krump","Sure, Ian. I'll give it a go here. I agree with you. First off, there's been a lot of noise around new business. It seems to be kind of all over the map. We listened to some calls. One of our major competitors is attributing some of their low premium growth to less new business, similar to kind of the tone that we're trying to pass on to you. I think the renewal business just tends to be quite a bit more profitable than new business. So they're probably being very careful about what they're picking up. I know that we're being very careful in all of our ranking of our renewal business and trying to make certain that we don't lose our best accounts. And I can tell you, we're not doing that. We're losing the accounts that we think we should be losing because we're not getting enough rate on them. But new business just has not been as attractive. If I go back in CCI's history a little bit, the new business in 2011 began to pull away from where the renewal book was at. We look at that on an accident year basis, break out the new lines from the renewals. And we had to take some decisive underwriting and pricing actions to bring that back in line. We culled a couple of troublesome segments. We funneled some of those classes of business to the most experienced underwriters, and then we increased our rate targets on those segments and lowered our new business goals. And the combination has made a marked improvement on our results in CCI, as you can see. We're doing similar things in the CSI. As John pointed out, though, the feedback loop is longer, but we're confident that they'll ultimately flow through as well.","John D. Finnegan","We track 12 months, 24 months on new business, first renewals and we expected, as I talked about before, some higher combined ratios on new. You're willing to pay that price for it. But it got out of hand about 2 years ago, when we aggressively attacked it. Now our new business -- 2012 accident year 12 months, our new business looks our renewals. I mean it's priced at a much lower volume. Now I hear some of the people talking about the great new business in the marketplace. I'll leave it to you. I mean, do you suspect that -- does it sound logical? Does it sound logical that -- the reason business goes to marketplace, most of the time, is because the customer doesn't like the rate and terms on the renewal and wants better. So the broker comes in -- I'm saying I'm going to get you better. He goes out to the marketplace, puts it out to a competitive bid. I mean, do you believe for a moment it comes in 10% higher in rate? I mean, that sounds ridiculous. It's just counterintuitive. The brokers wouldn't be on the business very long if that's how the [indiscernible] came about. So I just -- I don't get it. Unless you're comparing new business growth in the marketplace for another reason, which is the incumbent carrier doesn't want the business and then it probably goes at a higher nominal price, but I hope you're not comparing the nominal price on a much higher risk profile business to the rate you're getting on your nice renewal business. I mean, if you're doing that, maybe you're getting a higher rate, but that's certainly not a risk-adjusted rate comparison.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","To be honest, I agree 100% with you, John, I've just been very confused about those comments from others over the last year. My last one, real quick, is just a follow-up on risk management and Sandy. I was just wondering, specifically, if you could talk about Commercial business in Manhattan. And I don't want to get too dramatic about it. But your loss on this event was double Katrina, it was worse than similar size events -- close to similar sized events like Ike, or Wilma, or Japan. It seems like the 2 big cat events in, at least, reasonably recent history for you guys are both in Manhattan, which is this event and 9\/11. And I know it's an important part of your business and you can't necessarily abandon it or anything, but do you need -- I just wonder, long term, is that really as good a business as you thought it was? Or is it, maybe, a tougher business than you hoped, when you look at sort of 10-, 20-year track record, but with these 2 huge cats.","John D. Finnegan","Well, I think if you looked at it before Sandy, even when you had World Trade Center, it looks like a highly, highly profitable business in New York, more profitable than our business in the rest of the country, on average. But that's still a good question. Now just like any of this area, depends when you take the snapshot. After Irene and Sandy, it doesn't look quite as more highly profitable as it once did. So you're right, we have to focus on it. And that's what we're doing. You need rate, but you'll also need to focus your underwriting on it. And decide, if a place has gotten wiped out 2 storms in a row, it may be a difficult risk to underwrite. So, no, we do have to take a hard look at it and we're doing that, Ian.","Okay.

It is possible that actual results might differ from estimates and forecasts that Chubb's management team makes today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such differences appears in Chubb's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In prepared remarks and responses to questions during today's presentation, Chubb's management may refer to financial measures that are not derived from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in the press release and the financial supplement for the fourth quarter 2013, which are available on the Investors section of Chubb's website at www.chubb.com.","Please, also note that no portion of this conference call may be reproduced or rebroadcast in any form without Chubb's prior written consent. Replays of this webcast will be available through February 28, 2014. Those listening after January 30, 2014, should, please, note that the information and forecast provided in this recording will not necessarily be updated, and it is possible that the information will no longer be current.","Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Finnegan.","John D. Finnegan","Thank you for joining us. Chubb had an excellent fourth quarter and a year of record operating earnings per share of $8.03 and record net income per share of $9.04. These strong results reflect our successful segmentation strategy and related underwriting execution, which have enabled us to both improve the overall quality of our book and achieve margin expansion as earned rate increases continued to exceed our long-term loss cost trends in all 3 business units.","Our combined ratio for the quarter was 85.5 compared to 111.2 in the fourth quarter of 2012. The impact of catastrophe losses in the 2013 fourth quarter was 2.1 points compared to 29.7 points in the fourth quarter a year ago due to Storm Sandy. On an x cat basis, our combined ratio was 83.4 compared to 81.5 in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Fourth quarter operating income per share for 2013 was $2.07, and net income per share was $2.24 while the impact of catastrophes on both operating and net income was $0.17 per share. Premiums worldwide for the quarter were up 4%. In the U.S., the market remained firm during the quarter. Rates were up 6% for commercial and 8% for professional liability. Renewal change for Personal Lines was up 6%.","For our business outside the U.S., which accounted for about 1\/4 of our total net written premiums, we secured commercial and professional liability rate increases in the low single digits. GAAP book value per share at year end was $64.83, up 7% compared to year end 2012 and up 4% from September 30. Our capital position remains strong as evidenced by the new $1.5 billion share repurchase program we announced today.","As you saw in our press release, we have provided 2014 operating income per share guidance of $7.10 to $7.40. This assumes 5 points of catastrophe losses, which is 1 point higher than the assumed 4 points of catastrophe losses in our initial operating income per share guidance for 2013 to take into account anticipated higher than usual catastrophe losses in the first quarter of 2014.","Ricky will have more to say about guidance as well as our capital management activities. As in the past, Paul will provide detail today on CCI and CSI while Dino will discuss CPI and claims. In light of the new responsibilities that we announced in October beginning with our next conference call, Dino will be reporting on CCI and CSI while Paul will be reporting on CPI and claims. And I'll turn it over to Paul.","Paul J. Krump","Thanks, John. Chubb Commercial Insurance and Chubb's Specialty Insurance had outstanding performance in the fourth quarter capping off a terrific year for both. Starting with CCI, fourth quarter net written premiums were up 4% to $1.3 billion. Growth for CCI was 3% excluding the impact of currency and the effect of Storm Sandy's reinsurance reinstatement premiums had on the fourth quarter of 2012. CCI's fourth quarter combined ratio was 89 in 2013 compared to 118.7 in 2012. The impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 0.6 points of the combined ratio compared to 36.8 points in the year-ago fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's fourth quarter combined ratio was 88.4 in 2013 versus 81.9 in 2012 with the difference largely attributable to a greater amount of favorable reserve development in the year-ago quarter.","CCI's average renewal rate in the U.S. increased 6% in the fourth quarter. This compares to 7% in the third quarter of 2013 and 8% in the fourth quarter of 2012. This was the 11th consecutive quarter in which CCI secured rate increases in the U.S.","CCI achieved rate increases in every line of business. It was led by general liability and commercial automobile; followed by property, package, umbrella\/excess and workers' compensation. Furthermore, we secured renewal rate increases on 80% of the portfolio while having decreases on only 10%.","Over the past few years, we have been working hard to improve the quality of our book of business. This has entailed our driving differentiated rate increases, aggressively calling the poorest-performing segments, disproportionately retaining the best performers and writing the bulk of new business in lines where we believe we are the most rate adequate. This combination of pricing and underwriting actions has resulted in less premium volume in our lowest-performing groups where the rate need is the highest, and more premium volume in our best-performing groups where the rate need is lower. Mathematically, that results in a better-performing overall book of business that has less rate need to achieve adequacy, and that is exactly what we have achieved.","In short, the slight decline in rate increases that we've experienced in the last 2 quarters is consistent with how we have chosen to execute our pricing and retention strategy at the individual account level versus any significant change in the competitive landscape.","As our book approaches rate adequacy, we'd expect the size of rate increases to decline. That said, during the fourth quarter, we did see signs in the U.S. of increased competition in certain lines, most notably, large commercial property programs. Because of the increased property competition in the fourth quarter in the U.S., we chose to walk away from more renewals and to trim our participation on larger property programs. Although these actions nudged our property retention a bit lower, we maintained our disciplined approach to pricing each risk and still secured property renewal rate increases consistent with the renewal rate increases we were able to achieve for our overall CCI book.","As I noted earlier, CCI as a whole achieved average U.S. renewal rate increases of 6%, which is a couple of points above our long-term loss trend. Rate increases above the loss-cost trend should lead to margin expansion, especially on a book where aggressive action has improved its quality. Therefore, we are pleased with the renewal rate increases we've achieved, and we are not surprised that they have slowed a bit.","CCI's fourth quarter U.S. renewal retention was 83% compared to 85% in the third quarter and 83% in the corresponding year-earlier quarter. In CCI markets outside of the U.S., average renewal rates were in the low single digits. The amount of the increases varied slightly by region, but they were very consistent with what CCI experienced throughout 2013. CCI's new to lost business ratio in the U.S. was 0.7:1 compared to 0.9:1 in the third quarter of 2013 and 0.7:1 in the year-ago fourth quarter. For the full year, CCI's net written premiums increased 2% to $5.3 billion. The combined ratio was 86.5 in 2013 versus 99 in 2012. The impact of catastrophes accounted for 2.1 points in 2013 compared to 11.4 points in 2012. Excluding the impact of cats, CCI's combined ratio for the year improved 3.2 points to 84.4 in 2013 from 87.6 in 2012, reflecting earned rate increases, underwriting discipline and some good fortune.","Moving to Chubb Specialty Insurance. Net written premiums increased 2% in the fourth quarter to $705 million. The CSI combined ratio improved 6.6 points to an outstanding 81.9 from 88.5 in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the professional liability portion of CSI, net written premiums were up 2% to $627 million. This increase is largely attributable to our decision not to renew our professional liability reinsurance treaty. The combined ratio for professional liability improved to 85.9 from 93.7 in the year-ago quarter.","We are very pleased that the average renewal rate increase for professional lines in the U.S. was 8% in the fourth quarter of 2013. For perspective, this is the same as the increase we obtained in the third quarter and compares to 9% in the year-ago fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of 2013 was the ninth consecutive quarter of professional liability renewal rate increases in the U.S. and the sixth consecutive quarter that professional liability rate increases ranged from 8% to 9%.","Each of our professional liability lines of business in the United States achieved renewal rate increases in the fourth quarter. Increases were led by EPL, private company D&O and not-for-profit D&O followed by crime, E&O, fiduciary and public D&O. As in CCI, we continue to differentiate our rate and retention actions based on the performance of each line of business and each policy. We secured rate increases on more than 80% of renewed policies across all professional liability lines of business while fewer than 10% had decreases. As with CCI, rate increases were highest for our least adequately priced tranche of policies and lowest for our most adequately priced tranche. This customized approach to pricing, we believe enhances the overall quality of the portfolio.","In markets outside the U.S., average renewal rate increases for professional liability in the fourth quarter were consistent with the third quarter, rising by low single digits. Renewal retention for professional liability in the U.S. in the fourth quarter was 84%, down 2 points from the third quarter but up 3 points from the fourth quarter of 2012. Retention was the highest for our best-performing policies and lowest for our worst-performing, again, improving the overall quality of our book of business. The new-to-lost business ratio for professional liability in the fourth quarter was 0.8:1, unchanged from the third quarter as the slight decline in retention was offset by more new business growth.","Turning to the surety portion of our CSI book. Net written premiums in the fourth quarter were up 4% to $78 million, and the combined ratio was 53.9. For the full year 2013, CSI net written premiums increased 3% to $2.6 billion, and the combined ratio was an outstanding 84.3 compared to 91.3 in 2012. Professional liability premiums increased 2% to $2.3 billion, and the combined ratio was 89.3 versus 96.7 in 2012. Surety premiums for the year increased 6% to $314 million, and the combined ratio was a superb 47.2 versus 51.4 in 2012.","And with that, I will turn it over to Dino, who will review our personal lines results as well as corporate-wide claims.","Dino E. Robusto","Thanks, Paul, and good evening, everyone. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 6% in the fourth quarter to $1.1 billion. CPI premiums were up 3% excluding Storm Sandy reinsurance reinstatement premiums. CPI produced a combined ratio of 83.5 compared to 117.9 in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes for the quarter was 5.3 percentage points in 2013, whereas in the fourth quarter of 2012, the impact of cats was 40.1 points, mostly from Storm Sandy. CPI's x cat combined ratio for the quarter was 78.2 in 2013, similar to our result of 77.8 in the fourth quarter a year ago.","Homeowners premiums were up 6% for the quarter. They were up 2% excluding Storm Sandy reinsurance reinstatement premiums. The homeowners combined ratio was 75.8 compared to 131.3 in the corresponding quarter of 2012.","The impact of cats accounted for 8.5 points of the homeowners' combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 62 points in the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the homeowners combined ratio improved 2 points to 67.3 from 69.3 in the corresponding quarter of 2012. Also encouraging is that homeowners policy retention remained steady in the United States with the fourth quarter at 90% even as we continued to achieve strong renewal price increases in the quarter.","Homeowners new business premiums in the U.S. were up 8% over the fourth quarter of 2012. Personal auto premiums for the fourth quarter of 2013 increased 2%, and the combined ratio was 93.9 compared to 97.1 in the fourth quarter of 2012. Personal auto policy retention in the U.S. was 89%, consistent with the last 6 quarters. Personal auto new business premiums in the U.S. were up 6% over the fourth quarter of 2012.","In other personal lines, premiums were up 9%, reflecting strong growth in our accident business, and the combined ratio was 96.8%.","Turning now to full year results. CPI's net written premiums in 2013 increased 5% to $4.3 billion. CPI produced a combined ratio of 87, including a 7.2-point impact of catastrophes compared to a combined ratio of 94.4, including 13.7 points of catastrophes in 2012.","Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CPI's combined ratio for the full year improved to 79.8 in 2013 from 80.7 in 2012. For all of 2013, homeowners premiums were up 4%. The homeowners combined ratio was 82.3, including an 11.5-point impact from catastrophes compared to a combined ratio of 94.2 in 2012, including a 21-point impact from catastrophes. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the homeowners combined ratio for the full year improved 2.4 points to 70.8 in 2013 from 73.2 in 2012.","Personal auto premiums increased 6% in 2013 to $731 million, and the combined ratio was 94.8 compared to 93.4 in 2012. Other Personal lines premiums for the full year rose 6% to $929 million, and the combined ratio was 94.8.","Turning now to claims for Chubb overall. The impact of catastrophes in the fourth quarter of 2013 was 2.1 percentage points of the combined ratio, or $65 million before tax, including $20 million from cat events earlier in 2013 partially offset by $6 million, a favorable development from cat events prior to 2013.","The impact of catastrophes for all of 2013 was 3.4 points of the combined ratio, or $412 million before tax, reflecting $24 million of favorable reserve development from cat events that occurred in prior years.","A word on customer satisfaction. I'm very pleased to report that our U.S. Personal lines' customers' survey feedback on closed claims indicates a 97% highly satisfied rating for homeowners and 96% for personal auto for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Highly satisfied is the highest possible rating on the survey.","Before I turn it over to Ricky, let me make a few observations on the severe winter weather in the United States since the new year began. To date, weather has resulted in 2 declared catastrophes related to the freezing and winter storms that occurred in 19 states between January 3 and January 8. Both cats entailed freezing, ice, snow and wind, with the majority of our losses related to water damage from frozen burst pipes. As indicated in our press release, our preliminary estimate at this time for the combined effect of these 2 catastrophes to range of $150 million to $200 million dollars before tax. As we all know, the severe winter weather did not end on January 8. Unusually cold temperatures have plagued large sections of the country since then, resulting in additional losses. Since these conditions have not been classified as a catastrophe, we expect our non-cat weather-related losses in January 2014 to also be above average, whereas we enjoyed the low average non-cat weather-related losses in the first quarter of 2013.","And now I'll turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail.","Richard G. Spiro","Thanks, Dino. Looking first at our fourth quarter operating results. We had strong underwriting income of $430 million in the quarter. For the full year, underwriting income was $1.7 billion. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 4% to $284 million due once again to lower reinvestment rates in both our domestic and international fixed maturity portfolios. As a reminder, unlike some of our competitors, we do not include our share of the change in the net equity of our alternative investments and property and casualty investment income. We include it in net realized investment gains and losses.","Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $67 million, or $0.17 per share after tax, of which $0.09 per share came from our alternative investments.","For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $90 million, or $0.22 per share after tax, including $0.07 per share from alternative investments. Unrealized appreciation before tax at December 31, 2013, was $1.9 billion. For comparison, at year end 2012, unrealized appreciation before tax was $3.1 billion. The decline in unrealized appreciation in 2013 largely reflects the increase in interest rates that occurred during the year.","The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $42.6 billion as of December 31, 2013. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.9 years, and the average credit rating is Aa3. We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At December 31, 2013, our holding company portfolio had $2 billion of investments, including approximately $865 million of short-term investments.","Book value per share under GAAP at December 31, 2013, was $64.83 compared to $60.45 at year end 2012, an increase of 7%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available for sale fixed maturities at amortized costs, was $61.86 compared to $53.80 at 2012 year end, an increase of 15%.","As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2013 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: in CPI, we had about $25 million; CCI had about $35 million; CSI had about $55 million; and reinsurance assumed had none, bringing our total favorable development to about $115 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the fourth quarter combined ratio of about 4 points overall.","For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had about $205 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $40 million in CPI, $105 million in CCI, $50 million in CSI and $10 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2012 was about 7 points overall.","For the fourth quarter 2013, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 87 compared to 88.4 in last year's fourth quarter, an improvement of 1.4 points. Favorable development for the full year 2013 totaled about $710 million and had a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 6 points compared to $615 million in 2012 and a favorable impact on the combined ratio of 5 points. For the full year 2013, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 88.4 compared to 90.6 in 2012, an improvement of 2.2 points.","During the fourth quarter of 2013, our loss reserves decreased by $275 million, including a decrease of $256 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $19 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The impact of catastrophes decreased reserves by about $140 million, and the impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter was insignificant.","Turning now to capital management. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $325 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $93.72 per share. For the full year 2013, we repurchased 14.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.3 billion and an average cost of $87.33 per share.","As of December 31, 2013, there was approximately $107 million remaining under our January 2013 repurchase program, which we completed this month.","As we announced today, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. We intend to complete this new program by the end of January 2015 subject to market conditions and other factors.","As you saw in our press release, our guidance for 2014 operating income per share is a range of $7.10 to $7.40. I'd like to make a few comments regarding the assumptions behind our guidance, starting with our cat assumption. Our preliminary estimate of losses from the 2 catastrophes in early January is $150 million to $200 million before tax, or $0.39 to $0.52 per share after tax. This alone would translate into roughly 6 points on our first quarter combined ratio. Given that we have 2 months left in the quarter, it is reasonable to assume that there may be additional losses from catastrophes in the quarter. In light of these higher than normal first quarter catastrophe losses, our 2014 full year earnings guidance includes an annual catastrophe load of 5 points, which is 1 point higher than the annual catastrophe assumption included in our initial earnings guidance last year. For those who would like to make a higher or lower cat assumption, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses on 2014 operating income per share is approximately $0.33.","Our calendar year 2014 guidance also contemplates an increase in non-cat weather-related losses compared to the lower than average non-cat weather-related losses we experienced in both the first quarter a year ago and in all of 2013.","As Dino noted, we continued to incur additional losses from the winter freeze conditions which followed the 2 January catastrophes. These conditions have not been classified as catastrophes, and we expect that they will result in higher than normal January non-cat weather-related losses.","Our 2014 guidance of $7.10 to $7.40 also assumes that for the full year, net written premium growth will be 2% to 4%. We assume a continuation of current exchange rates resulting in no currency impact. We will have a combined ratio of 89 to 90, which includes the catastrophe loss assumption of 5 points. Property and casualty investment income after tax will decline 4% to 6%. And finally, our guidance assumes that we will have 245 million average diluted shares outstanding and that we will compete the new $1.5 billion share repurchase program on a pro rata monthly basis by the end of January 2015. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we have projected 2014 operating income per share at $7.25. This is $0.78 below actual 2013 operating income per share of $8.03. The difference between our 5-point cat assumption for 2014 versus actual cat losses of 3.4 points in 2013 accounts for roughly $0.50 of the $0.78 differential.","And now, I'll turn it back to John.","John D. Finnegan","Thanks, Ricky. Chubb had an excellent fourth quarter, posting the second-highest operating income per share in our history. We generated annualized GAAP and operating ROE in the quarter of 14.4% and enjoyed very strong book value growth of 4% from the prior quarter. These excellent fourth quarter results topped off a terrific year in which we achieved record operating and net income per share, driven largely by an 82.7 x cat combined ratio, 3 points better than 2012.","We continued to actively manage our capital in 2013 by returning $1.8 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Our continued commitment to capital management is demonstrated by the new $1.5 billion share repurchase program we announced today. Renewal rates improved in all 3 SBUs, with an average U.S. rate increases for the full year of 7% for standard commercial lines and 8% for professional liability. We also achieved average U.S. renewal rate increases of 6% for personal lines. A slight decline in renewal rate increases experienced in the fourth quarter in our overall commercial businesses largely reflects the growing rate adequacy in our book, and fourth quarter rate increases continued to exceed our longer-term loss-cost trends.","As Dino already discussed earlier, 2014 is off to a difficult start because of the severe weather we experienced in January. This has resulted in our increasing our cat assumption for the year with a corresponding reduction in our earnings guidance. Nonetheless, the $7.10 to $7.40 of operating earnings per share provided in our guidance for 2014 would, if achieved, represent the second-highest annual operating earnings per share in Chubb history.","With that, we'll be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","My first question relates to the discussion on increased competition on, I guess, the large commercial accounts. Can you sort of remind us firstly what the percentage of large accounts is as of CCI? And was this a handful of competitors? Or is this a more sort of pervasive development?","Paul J. Krump","Amit, it's Paul. Let me, first of all, tell you what we mean by large when we're talking about accounts. And by that, we're talking about premiums basically in excess of $1 million for the standard commercial lines. That portion of our portfolio is about 6% to 7%. Now that 6% to 7% includes for CCI property. It includes casualty, workers' comp, umbrella\/excess, et cetera.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Got it. And the second piece on the competition?","Paul J. Krump","Yes, I would tell you that we have seen -- and again, the competition has just picked up a bit. But again, we're -- I want to emphasize to you that our property rates are still in line with our overall book. And we only saw retention come down just a tad. So I don't want to overplay that fact. There are a handful of programs, quite frankly, that we have participated on the past, that we just thought the rates came down too much, and we either just walked away from them or we cut our participation on them.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Got it. That's helpful. The only other question I have is under reserve releases [ph] in CCI, I understand the number fluctuates, and I think Q3 was $100 million or so. But if I look at sort of the trend line, should we be making something regarding the $25 [ph] million reserve releases? Are we sort of getting to the point where redundancies are sort of running out? Or am I oversimplifying this quarter's number?","Richard G. Spiro","Amit, it's Ricky. Why don't I attempt to give you some color on that? Compared to the earlier quarters in 2013, part of the reason why CCI's favorable development slowed down in the fourth quarter was due to a larger adverse impact from A&E losses that we incurred in the fourth quarter. Every year end, we do a detailed study on A&E, and we made an adjustment in the fourth quarter mainly on the environmental side. Another important component is the smaller favorable impact we experienced in the short-tail commercial property classes in the quarter. As we've discussed in the past, CCI has benefited from some remarkably good property results over the past several periods. Really, it began with the fourth quarter of '12. And some of that good fortune had been in the form of very strong, favorable prior-year development. And in the fourth quarter, we still had some favorable commercial property reserve development but not to the same magnitude. And then the final comment I'd make -- and I should point out that if you look at the full year 2013, CCI actually had almost $100 million more in favorable development in total than in the prior year. So still, it's a pretty good story.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","On the net premium written guidance of plus 2 to 4, so if you guys, I think grew about 3% in 2013 in a fairly hard market, why should we expect the same? Or why do you guys expect roughly the same in a market where pricing seems to be trending down a little bit and apparently, retention levels are trending downwards a little bit as well? Maybe there's a reinsurance component there too we should be thinking about.","Paul J. Krump","First of all, I would tell you that I won't make the assumption that our retention is trending down. Just speaking -- again, just sticking with CCI for a minute because they did have retention come down a little bit in the fourth quarter. But for perspective over the last 10 quarters, CCI has traded in a retention range of 83 to 85. When it comes down or goes up in any quarter, it's really because we've probably won or retained or lost a couple of larger accounts. We commented on that specifically last quarter. In the third quarter, we retained a couple more. We said then not to read into that as a trend. But that said, I would suggest to you that as the book becomes more rate adequate, we will enjoy incrementally over time some improvement in the retention in the book of business. Likewise, I would suggest that we are finding better-priced business over time as well. Now we're being very careful to make certain that we're using the same underwriting discipline and looking to write it in market segments that we think are the most adequate and where we have real advantages around things like loss control and form and subject matter expertise. But we are seeing some opportunities in the marketplace, and we're actively going after them.","John D. Finnegan","Yes. Similarly, on personal lines, rate of retention was consistent in the fourth quarter as it was in the third quarter, and it was also consistent both for homeowners and for auto. And our pricing momentum has continued. It's our third year, and we continue to file mid-single-digit price increases. So steady as she goes in personal lines.","Paul J. Krump","And flipping back to the professional liability, I think you can see that in that book of business, the rate increases have been incredibly steady, right? For the last 6 quarters, they've been in that 8 to 9 range. I think that we're very active in that market. We got a great team, and they're looking for new business. Surety component, frankly, that's a lumpy business. You'll see that move around quarter-to-quarter [indiscernible] construction projects. But...","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. Okay. Lastly, great color on January's weather losses. I guess is there a way for us to size up what the impact of non-cat weather could be in January? Like, what -- could it be half of what you showed in terms of the $150 million to $200 million? Could it $100 million? Or we're thinking small numbers?","Dino E. Robusto","Yes. It's too early. It's too early to really be able to tell. We do know, as we've indicated, rate non-cat weather-related losses in the first quarter of 2013 was a couple of points below the sort of 5-year average. So you know that was low. And obviously, this is some pretty severe weather, so we're going to see some additional ones. It's probably fair to assume it's going to be above it. But at this point, it's a little too early to tell. And clearly, the cold weather continues.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering, first, what the benefit of -- on Chubb's top line and bottom line would be in 2014 from falling reinsurance rates?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes, it's Ricky. I don't think we can give you a specific number. Obviously, we read all the same articles and stories that you guys do about what's happened to the January 1 renewables. As you know, we don't renew our major cat treaties until April 1, so I think it would be premature for us to speculate as to what that would lead to. Obviously, declining reinsurance rates would be a good thing at the end of the day in terms of the overall cost of our program, but it's a little too early for us to comment.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. In the fourth quarter, the casualty line in CCI combined ratio went up to 103. What was that due to?","Paul J. Krump","This is Paul, Jay. I think the biggest driver here compared to the earlier quarters was the fact that we increased the current accident year loss ratio on casualty in the fourth quarter. That was primarily to recognize one very large unusual loss event in accident year 2013 that affected the general liability class. We also experienced a lesser amount of favorable prior-year reserve development in the fourth quarter as continued favorable development in the Excess classes was mostly offset by adverse development in the other casualty reserves, mainly related to our legacy asbestos and environmental exposures.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Oh, so that environmental hit was in the casualty line?","Paul J. Krump","Yes. Correct.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","How much was that?","Richard G. Spiro","Environmental for the fourth quarter? Somewhere between $45 million, $50 million.","Dino E. Robusto","$40 million of environmental losses were incurred in the fourth quarter.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So that impacted the PYD number and, obviously, the current year underwriting results?","Paul J. Krump","[indiscernible].","John D. Finnegan","It was adverse development.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. So -- all right. So it resulted in less reserve releases because of that, right? [indiscernible] $40 million?","John D. Finnegan","Correct. Correct.","Dino E. Robusto","Yes.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, what -- Ricky, what level of interest rates would be needed for investment income to be unchanged as opposed to being down 4% to 6%?","Richard G. Spiro","That's a hard one. I don't know if I can give you a number. I will tell you that obviously, as the portfolios has been rolling over for the last couple of years, and as it continues to roll over, if interest rates stay sort of in the general range where they are now, I will continue to see a decline in investment income over the next couple of years. That decline should decrease. But as to what interest rate we would need to get to flat, I'm not sure I can answer that. It obviously depends a lot on the maturities and all the other things that go into calculating investment income.","John D. Finnegan","It really depends on, Jay, when. I mean, if you\u2019re talking immediately -- if you got a 100 basis point improvement in interest rates, we roll over $5 billion of sold assets next year. Let's take a full year basis. Obviously, it only happens on a half-year basis, but that's $50 million; $50 million is probably about 4% of our investment income. So I mean -- I'm going to give you an idea. Now if you got 100 basis points in your whole portfolio, it'd be a lot bigger than that, but that takes a long time. But -- and you don't get 100 basis points in a day, of course, so it tends to move in. So -- I mean, over a couple of years, if you've got 50 or 100 basis points, you'd see a huge difference.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. Okay. And then just a last one for Paul. You mentioned that in many areas, increasingly adequate rates, what's their -- what's to prevent the level of competition dramatically increasing as other competitors target that business?","Paul J. Krump","Well, Jay, I think, as we've said many times, there's a couple of -- I could make the case that the catastrophes in general are moving up, the low interest-rate environment that you just talked about. Yes, there's a lot of capital in the market, but I haven't seen yet where the industries' returns are that spectacular. So I guess, that would be something. But all I can tell you is what we've seen so far.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I was wondering if we could talk a little more about the large account business, where you're giving us some sort of useful market color. I'm wondering if you'd give us just some more sort of flavor of what a typical program looks like that you're walking away from? I guess, first off, is it syndicated? Are your participating in the upper layers? Are you the lead? And sort of more at the product level and as the -- sort of what's driving the changes? It's sort of new competition coming in, or new approaches from other players in this market? Or is it basically just that the margin, people are a bit more price competitive and that's leading you guys to decide the -- price reductions? I'm sorry, I'll just ask, what are the price reductions on a typical account that you're seeing, that you're walking away from?","Paul J. Krump","Okay, Josh. Just so I can put this into some perspective, okay. We're really talking about large Monoline property that we experienced that in the fourth quarter. So you guys are always interested in color, so I didn't want to dodge that. We did see some of that. But we are not a large property writer, per se. We do participate occasionally. You'll see us on some real estate investment trust. You'll see us on some larger institutional-type property risk, universities, hospitals, et cetera. Yes, those are have been syndicated oftentimes, but that's a small portion of our book. So when I said we saw a tad bit more competition and a bit of retention drop, it was just that. We're talking just small incremental amounts. And yes, there's been 1 or 2 new players that has entered that market. They brought in some additional capacity. I think that we have seen the prices go down on a magnitude of anywhere from, say 5% to 15% on the deals. Now again, I said we are getting property rate increases on our average book that are in line with what we got for the 6% for the overall quarter. So it's pretty hard for underwriters to justify taking an account, even, if it's that good in giving up that type of a rate decrease if that gives you some additional color.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's helpful. I guess, one other question, and I don't know if this is related or not. But one thing I noticed was you guys seemed to be shrinking the actual top line in your multi-peril product line over the past 1 or 2 quarters. And I'd always assumed that was sort of a midmarket package, where I would have thought there was -- I mean, I know you're getting pricing here, but I would have thought the market would be allowing you to sort of keep that more flat? And I'm just sort of wondering what the -- whether the market is actually getting more competitive there, too, or is it that -- or is this maybe a function of your re-underwriting or something?","Paul J. Krump","I would not say that we've seen the same uptick, if you will, in competition in multiple peril we saw in the large property portion of the book. I think that you hit on it. It's been our disciplined approach. We'd certainly -- we've been doing very well in multiple peril, and we're looking to grow that line faster. So keep to pushing on our underwriters to find more opportunities.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's great. I'll queue off, but just one last thing. Your -- how would you guys characterize this as different from 10 years ago when we started seeing price -- sort of slowing momentum in maybe 2004 or '05?","Paul J. Krump","Okay, I guess I'll try to take a stab at that. I mean, I think what we saw was the trajectories were very different 10 years ago. I think that post-9\/11, the type of increases that we were seeing, they were accelerating and they decelerated. This is a much different marketplace. People have very good metrics in their -- our competitors are trying to be very rational. I don't think reinsurance is driving it to the same degree that it had in the past. People's primary carriers, our primary competitors, have very strong balance sheets. I think they've got a lot better analytics as we do today, and people are trying to find niches where they have competitive advantages and compete there.","Richard G. Spiro","And I'd also add -- it's Ricky -- don't forget, we are in a much different investment income and interest rate environment today as well. So that also comes into play.","Operator","We'll go next to Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to isolate on the combined ratio guidance for 2014. As I look at it, you just did an 86 on the year. You're starting guidance back then -- back a year ago was 89 to 91, so call it a 90. So you beat by 4 points. It wasn't cats. It was largely better underwriting elsewhere. If I look at the '14 guidance compared to really where you came in '13, we're losing kind of 1 point, 1.5 points on caps. I would assume -- I don't know if this level of reserve release can continue, but maybe we're losing a little there. But what I'm trying to understand is, is there maybe a point of non-cat creep that we're seeing? I mean I'm having a hard time getting to the midpoint of your starting combined ratio guidance. If you could help with the drivers, that would be appreciated.","Richard G. Spiro","Sure. Why don't I try to give you a little color to answer that question. So if you look at our guidance at the midpoint, if you do it on an x cat combined ratio basis, we'd be at 84.5, which is about a little less than 2 points higher than our 2013 x cat combined ratio. So just put cats to the side just on an x-cat basis. And as we've said in the past when we've determined our guidance, our calendar year guidance is based on a mix of scenarios, both with respect to performance by the individual business units and as it relates to current accident year results and potential prior year development. So therefore, the almost 2-point deterioration on our x cat combined ratio in '14 can be the result of higher x cat losses, lower prior period development as you pointed out, or a combination of the 2. As we discussed earlier, our 2013 results have benefited from x cat weather-related, large commercial property and homeowner fire losses, which have been well below our average levels over the past 5 years. So therefore, any reversion to historical averages would result in some deterioration in our x cat combined ratio. To this point, as I highlighted and Dino did as well in our earlier remarks, our 2014 guidance assumes higher x cat combined ratio due to the extreme cold weather that we've experienced so far in January. In addition, it's very difficult to predict favorable developments since this is a function of loss trends, but we have said in the past that we expect this favorable development to decline from what we view to be unsustainably high levels. I'll leave it to you to make your own assumptions regarding favorable development going forward. Hopefully, this gives you a little more color on our thought process. So it's a combination of the 2.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. That makes perfect sense. I guess more directly then, do you expect the rate of -- do you expect -- well, I guess my base case is that pricing is running in excess of loss trend. Is that true across the business lines? And if it's true, why wouldn't you see continued margin expansion? I fully appreciate that PPD and the x cat losses may come in a little higher year-over-year, but why would we all of a sudden hit the wall on margin expansion so quickly in 2014?","John D. Finnegan","Let me address that. I mean, margin expansion is not -- does not equate exactly to different movements in accident year results. I mean -- so let's take aside prior period development, you say. Margins -- you start -- because it's easy sort of to model, margin expansion is rates versus long-term cost trends. And we probably ran this year at 2 to 2.5 points of margin expansion. Now if I listen to the tone of the questions on the call, seems to suggest to me that most of you don't believe we'll run at the same levels next year, the industry won't run there. So make your own assumption. I think we'll still be very positive next year. But whether it be 2, 2.5 points, it's for you to judge. Then against that, you have other things. I mean, you have the short-term loss trends. I mean, the reason we did so well this year was just not margin expansion. That was 2 points. It was a lot of -- with a lot of a, underwriting, and b, good fortune. So for example, in homeowners non-cat-related weather, we ran 4.3% for the year, 5-year average of 5.8. There's 1.5 points. X cat fire loss ratio, 6.6 to 9.7. These are good things. Commercial property, large losses, significantly lower than prior periods. So these were all very positive things. So when you apply the margin expansion analysis, you can't apply -- you have to apply for the rate base period. You can't apply it to a base period that isn't necessarily in line with normal trends. What we do is we apply to -- so we take the yin and the yang. We take the margin expansion of the positive, and then look at, well, what will happen to these actual losses when we go forward? Now we don't really know that, except we were informed a little by the January events. But we can make assumptions. We find it's prudent to assume that you're not going to run 3 points over the x cat fire loss every year or 2 points under the non-cat-related whether loss. And then when you see January's cold freeze come in, you're really feeling like maybe you ought to be a little bit more conservative, a little bit more prudent. Well, that wipes out a lot -- if you have 2 points of margin expansion, doesn't take much of this stuff to kind of offset it. Now we're not saying the accident year won't be better. We have a lot of scenarios, and most of them, I think the accident year, perhaps it will be better? Who knows? I mean -- but it won't be as good as margin expansion. It could go either way. A lot depends on how these January storms turn out, how the non-cat-related weather there on the rest of the year, the fire losses. But we said we have to assume that they're going to revert more to the norm. I mean, you wouldn't allow someone to come over with a budget that assumes extraordinary, good performance based on luck for a long period of time. So we start there, and then of course you have prior-period development, and I don't know what'll run. I mean, I -- Ricky said we've been saying for a long time, we can't sustain it. I let him say it this time because I've been saying it for 8 years, and I've been wrong. But having said that -- I mean, I just don't know. I mean, if you were drawing, I mean, sort of a curve, you might say that 6 to 7 points might not be the middle of the curve every year going forward. It might be something different. So those are the trends. You're have -- you're right. You have likely margin expansion. As to whether that translates into better accident year assaults depends on a lot of good fortune. And as to whether that translates to better reported results depends on how prior-period development comes out.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ricky, could you talk about the years that drove the favorable development in specialty and CCI in particular?","Richard G. Spiro","Sure. Or...","John D. Finnegan","Let's do the 2, the overall favorable development of the company. Basically, there's no great story here. That -- most of it came for 2007 through 2010, but a significant portion, maybe 20%, came from accident year 2012, and that's not long tail line. So that's due primarily to very favorable experience we enjoyed in the commercial property classes this year, which we've talked about. Accident year 2004 to 2012 were all favorable. Professional [indiscernible] '12 was very favorable.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Was that Sandy? Was that -- somebody do this in the reversal of Sandy...","John D. Finnegan","Oh, no, no, no. It was just what we've been -- just some stuff I was just talking about, how we have low large losses in commercial property this year. A lot of that didn't go to the accident year. A lot of that went to prior period, too. And so we had very good prior period in 2012, especially in commercial property. In professional liability, it came from accident years 2010 and prior.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then I guess what would have to happen for you to really pursue more growth? I mean, is it -- when your profitability gets to a certain amount, I get it, you've got the prior year and the non-cat weather and lots of -- and cats and lots of moving parts. But is there a point at which you say, \"Look, we're -- we've got a good baseline here. Let's go ahead and let's grow now because we're not going to be able to rely on these movements to grow earnings or to improve performance. So now we've got to grow.\" I mean, is there a point where you say that? Or is it -- I'm sure it's more complicated than that, but I'd love to get your...","John D. Finnegan","No, no, no. Sure, but we do it -- listen, what happens is that -- Paul was talking about that, we're achieving greater rate adequacy by line. Now the degree of rate adequacy drives what our pricing requirements are in the marketplace. You set your more rate adequate, you obviously are willing to take a different price in classes where you're not rate adequate. So you will effectively -- we will be pricing the product more for growth than for sheer profitability as we -- after we've achieved rate adequacy and you see that in more and more lines. So you'll effectively see that in our pricing of our product as we go forward. We won't turn on, though, a switch and say, \"We're now a growth company.\" We'll do it through the pricing of our product based on an economic analysis of that product.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So like -- so last year, you were 89 and 91. You came in -- obviously came in below that. And this year, you're kind of looking at 89 to 90. I mean, what would keep you from growing more than -- because it looks like -- I mean, if you're getting 5% rate or 6% rate or 8% rate, you're still -- you're growing top line less than rate. So just for attention, it doesn't seem like you're growing exposures that much, although the business seems like it's pretty adequate from a profitability perspective.","John D. Finnegan","Yes, you'd say that -- at the current levels we're riding, we might be running that accident year. At 4 points to cat, you might be saying we're running out at 10% to 12%. So I mean, we're getting -- probably not overall fully price adequate because really, from a pricing perspective, you'd have to load that with a little bit higher cats for volatility. But overall, book is reasonably good. And individual lines, some of them are very good. So that -- and we reflect in our pricing our economic perspective on all of those products. And as you get a little bit more price competitive, you obviously hope to grow the business some.","Operator","We'll go next to Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is on the retentions and the new business. You saw that fall off sequentially. I just wanted to clarify whether that's purely related to the large commercial property that you saw? Or was it also because your pricing was maybe a tad higher than peers?","Paul J. Krump","Vinay, I think that -- just so I'm making certain that I'm following this. This is Paul. The -- again, the -- if you're talking about the retention in CCI, it was up in the third and down just a little bit in the fourth, and that was just really due to a couple of larger accounts that we either retained or -- in the third quarter, or we lost a couple extra in the fourth quarter. The retention overall for professional liability has been very, very steady. So -- but it's been up. If you're looking at it from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, then it's up in professional liability, and it's spot on for CCI when you look at fourth quarter to fourth quarter. So again, I'm just not certain I'm following. Are you talking sequential quarters? Are you talking...","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Oh, yes. Yes. sequential quarters, I think. Third quarter versus fourth quarter I guess. It was a slight deterioration.","Paul J. Krump","Yes. That's pretty much it. I mean, there are some people out in our field say that the fourth quarter tends to come down a little bit just because there's a little bit of the year-end push for some new business by some people, and the competition goes up a little bit. I've been around for 30-plus years. I don't know if I completely buy into that theory, but it's one thought. But you do see a little bit of movement between quarter-to-quarter.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. The second question is I also wanted to clarify the non-cat, where [indiscernible] guys are budgeting a more normal year this year versus last year. That's '14 versus '13. Do you have a number for how much you're increasing your non-cat losses meant for this year versus last year?","Richard G. Spiro","No, we can't give you a specific number. As I mentioned in -- answered to one of in the earlier questions, we do a whole bunch of scenarios when we come up with our guidance. So I can't give you one specific number.","Operator","We'll go next to Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions on the personal auto side. First, when we look sequentially, the net written premium growth seems to have slowed pretty quickly. And second, on an x cat basis, it looks like we had more than 400 basis points of, pardon me, of higher x cat loss ratio movement year-over-year. I was wondering if you could talk about that a little.","Dino E. Robusto","Yes. Sure. It's Dino. I'll talk about the auto growth first. First of all, it continued to be strong in the United States as well as actually in most countries we write auto outside the U.S. But that currency translation really deteriorated meaningfully such that the overall positive growth outside U.S. on local currency actually ended up being negative when expressed in U.S. dollars. We also had a little less local currency growth in Brazil in reaction to some rate-taking efforts to improve the profitability of certain of our customer segments. But in general, we remain very pleased with our continued progress in growing auto as evidenced by the full year growth rate, which is 6%. And on the profitability on the x cat, it's really -- it's a combination of a few factors. The expense ratio is up over about 1 point, which is due primarily to higher costs in our Brazilian operation, which I've mentioned before where we continue to invest in our capabilities. It was a little less favorable development and a little higher current accident year loss ratio, but nothing on the loss side that really raised any major concern. Indeed, the full year result is actually in line with full year result of 2011 at about 93.2. So we remain very pleased with our auto performance, and we continue to drive our strategy, which, as I've mentioned before, is a cross-sell strategy to our homeowner customers in most of the jurisdictions around the world. And so you'll get a little bit of fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. But in general, very pleased with the results.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. In your target segment, are you seeing any ramp-up in competitiveness? Again, I'm talking personal auto domestically.","Dino E. Robusto","There's only a few players in the high net worth auto market. There's been -- there's maybe a little bit more competition, but the reality is we have a very specific niche. It's just a cross-sell strategy. We've invested in technology and analytics in our auto and our panorama auto pricing tool, which I've talked to you about before, and it's allowing us to bring a top-end bottom, top-end service at a relatively competitive price. We've managed to cross-sell about 30% of our homeowners. That's the good news. The good news? It's only 30%, which means we got a lot more. So in general, we see it as a positive opportunity and not really experiencing or getting into the competition that you sometimes see and talk about in auto with the large Monoline auto players, and that's not really our game.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm wondering if someone could talk about the potential repercussions of this Halliburton case in the Supreme Court, which is challenging Basic versus Ferguson (sic) [Levinson]. Have you seen anything for your professional liability business?","Dino E. Robusto","It's Dino. Look, we clearly, we recognize that it has the potential to change securities class action landscape, and securities class actions has historically been the main driver of our most severe public D&O losses. But at this point, there's a number of potential outcomes in the case, and it's -- we're not going to be able to predict -- that we're not going to predict what we think is most likely. Obviously, we'll continue to watch the case closely. And when it's decided, we'll evaluate the decision and its potential impact on the public D&O. But there's several potential outcomes. It's early, and let's -- we'll all watch it.","Operator","We'll go next to John Thomas with William Blair.","John Frank Thomas","I would like to know what you're seeing in the workers' comp market? It's been one of the biggest growers for you over the past 3 years.","Paul J. Krump","Yes, this is Paul. I would tell you, we've been really very pleased with our workers' compensation. Much like Dino just talked about auto being a cross-sell to the homeowners, virtually all of our workers' comp is a cross-sell to a package or an overall account situation. And if you look at our combined ratios, they just really distinguished themselves versus the competition. So we've been pleased to find opportunities to grow that line. Quite frankly, in the past, there have been a number of competitors that underpriced that line severely as they had been reprofiling their book and getting more rate increases. Those customers have been coming to us because we handle the other lines of insurance and asking if we'd be interested in their workers' compensation because we know these clients and we were interested in quoting their workers' comp before. We're certainly interested in quoting it now, so we're happy to take advantage of those opportunities when they come our way.","John Frank Thomas","And then on your net written premium to equity leverage ratio, it's at 0.8 now. Do you have any plans to increase that in the future, possibly given that rate increases are declining and growth may not be there? Would you consider increasing the leverage to get ROE higher?","Richard G. Spiro","I don't have any particular plan to move that dramatically. We talked about the growth side earlier our thought there. We do share buybacks. We pay dividends, and we use that as a way to return capital to shareholders. I'm not sure any other -- there's anything else I would point to.","Operator","Our last question comes from Ian Gutterman with BAM.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","First, can you give any more color on those 2 January cats? I know you said pipe damage and such. It just seems like an awfully high number for that. Is this a -- do you have any industry loss numbers? Or maybe, do you feel that you had an outsized loss? Because maybe there was a couple of really high-end homes that had severe damage. Or just any kind of way of helping us think about it.","Dino E. Robusto","I think it's a large amount essentially because the 2 severe winter weather catastrophes really impacted a large geographic area, 19 states, as I mentioned. In particular, the second declared cat, which had the much larger impact to us, if you recall, began its trek across the midsection of the country, then it moved south and it moved east. It went to states as far south as Mississippi and Georgia, and as far north as New York. And as [indiscernible] said, if you look at some of those -- the wind chill factors and the temperatures in some places down to minus 60, wind gusts at 45 miles an hour. So most of it is frozen burst pipes. You have some water infiltration, other leaks, some damage from snow load. I think just given the timing of our earnings release, I think we're one of the first to sort of comment it, but I think just based on the large geography that these 2 cats blanketed, I think it's safe to assume when all company personal and commercial losses are tallied up, these catastrophes are going to represent a substantial industry event.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","Got it. That's helpful. And if I could move to professional lines real quick. The accident year looks like if I'm guessing right, coming up to about a 95, which is a big improvement. Anything unusual on that? Or is that pricing rolling through, and we should kind of expect a mid-90s going forward?","John D. Finnegan","Well, let's say that -- first of all, the reported number was about 7 points higher, a little bit of favorable development. But in the fourth quarter, we run 96 as an accident year versus 102. So we're very pleased with the 6-point improvement. And for the year, we're at 98 versus 103, so a 5-point improvement. Now the unusual part in the fourth quarter is professional liability has a seasonally low expense ratio in the fourth quarter, always does. So you look in that 2 or 3 points versus the average for the year. So I'd say you ought to be looking at it -- as a baseline case for 2013, the 98 for the year. The 98 to the 96 have the same loss ratio, it's just a different expense ratio. So one, we're tremendously happy with the progress from our rate increases, from our underwriting discipline, the actions we've taken. Had great movement, 67 points. That's a big movement but of course precipitated by an awfully bad starting point. I think that it was one of our focuses for the year, and we've done a good job in that area. Paul and the crew did an excellent job. I think we're running 98 now, which is a lot better than 103 last year. And if we continue to get the kind of rate increases we're looking at now and maintain our discipline, I'd expect an improvement again to the mid-90s next year. I don't think you'll see the same size of improvement because we're not coming off [indiscernible]. But I think it looks good for professional liability as we go into this year as long as the market holds up.","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management L.P.","And the change in the reinsurance treaty, can you give us a sense how much of that impacts premiums? And I assume that's obviously going to impact the improvement in the combined ratio as well?","Paul J. Krump","Yes, this is Paul, Ian. Yes, I think that that's going to help us a little bit here. It was really in the FI space where there was a specific treaty there. And as John mentioned, we've done a tremendous amount of work over the last 3, 4 years cleaning up that book of business. So as we analyze how losses were flowing through and what we've done to the book of business, we just decided we didn't need that treaty anymore.","John D. Finnegan","It had a 2-point or so impact on premium growth in the quarter for professional liability, not for the corporation as a whole. As to what it says to combined ratio, well I guess we'll only know after we see what losses are and whether we should have kept the reinsurance or not.","Well, we think it will improve it a little, but we're not talking -- I mean, that's not going to be a huge factor, and again, depends where losses would have come up, so you never know till after the fact.","Thank you. Thanks for joining us, and have a good night.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"5109":["Chubb Ltd.

Fourth Quarter Year-End 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. There will be a question-and-answer session at the end of today's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Karen Beyer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Karen Beyer","Thank you and welcome to our December 31, 2018 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call.","Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to Company's performance and growth, pricing and business mix, and economic market conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release, and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce our speakers this morning. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll then take your questions. Also with us today to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.","And now, I will turn the call over to Evan.","Evan Greenberg","Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we reported core operating income in the fourth quarter of $2.02 per share. The quarter was marked by greater volatility from elevated natural catastrophes around the world from a variety of perils and from increased property loss activity in the U.S. On the other hand, we had strong premium revenue growth, enjoyed improved commercial P&C pricing globally, and produced record net investment income. Core operating income was $935 million and included $506 million of after-tax CAT losses, compared with a $1.5 billion income last year, which included a tax benefit of $450 million and tax of $331 million.","Simply, to give you a sense of underlying strength, excluding CATs and the tax benefit, core operating income per share in the quarter was up 6.5% over prior. Our published P&C combined ratio was 93.1% and included 8.5 points of CATs on the combined. On a current accident year basis, excluding CATs, the combined was 88.3% versus 86.4% prior year. The accident year was impacted in the quarter by elevated large loss activity in our U.S commercial property portfolio in both our major account and E&S businesses, as well as in our middle-market division. And this added about 1.4 points to our combined ratio. From what we can see, this is simply volatility or variability in a short period result, not a trend.","We also continued to experience elevated losses in our U.S. homeowners\u2019 book, which we have discussed in some detail with you. We are on track with the pricing, product and underwriting strategies that we outlined on last quarter's call. Given, the state-by-state regulatory nature of this business, it\u2019ll take some time to show through in the results on a run rate basis.","On the plus side of short-tail activity, our combined ratio in the quarter included a strong contribution from our crop insurance business as well as positive pretax prior period reserve development, which benefited by $130 million from a one-time reinsurance settlement in our legacy A&E runoff liabilities. Premium revenue growth in the quarter was 5.8% in constant dollars and FX then had a negative impact of 1.6 points, bringing the published growth to over 4%. The pricing environment overall improved over the third quarter in a number of our businesses. And this momentum continued into January with much better tone in actual rate movements compared to the fourth quarter prior year. In fact, in terms of price movement, globally, this was the best and most broad-based quarter of the year and the best in several years. We are also seeing more dislocation in certain markets and that means opportunity.","For the full-year, our growth was 4.4%. Geo-economic environment notwithstanding, I expect we will at a minimum, maintain that range in constant dollars and with some variability quarter-to-quarter. There is a great deal of optimism and positive energy across the company. Net investment come in the quarter was $903 million, was up about 3.5% and contributed to net investment income for the year of $3.6 billion, both were records. Our results are being driven by strong positive cash flow and higher reinvestment rates that now exceed our current book yield and are beginning to benefit from an improving interest rate environment.","Core operating income for the year was $4.4 billion or $9.44 per share, up 18% on a per share basis from \u201817. Earnings were split between P&C underwriting income of $2.6 billion and adjusted pretax investment income of $3.6 billion. For your information, pretax CAT losses for the year were $1.6 billion, about $700 million more than we planned for when calculating our expecting CAT amount. Our earnings led to a core operating ROE of 8.7% for the year or 9.8% on an expected CAT basis. For the year, the P&C combined ratio was 90.6% compared to 94.7% prior. And on a current accident year basis, excluding CATs, the combined ratio for the year was 88% versus 87.6% prior year.","Book value per share was down about 0.5%, and tangible book per share was flat, unfavorably impacted by the mark-to-market effect of rising interest rates and foreign exchange. Adjusting for the mark, book and tangible per share were up 2.7% and 5.8%, respectively. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value CATs and prior very development.","Turning to growth and market conditions. Commercial P&C pricing and underwriting for the business we wrote in the quarter, was as good or better than what we saw in the third quarter and overall for the year, and materially better than this time last year. The industry and Chubb is no exception, is experiencing margin pressure in numerous classes and an improving rate environment, particularly in the U.S. and the London wholesale market is important. I hope it continues to improve and spread because rate is needed in other markets.","I mentioned at the opening that we began to see some signs of dislocation on the margin in the market as some carriers curved their appetite for certain lines of business by reduced line sizes or exiting from markets altogether. That's another marker of affirming or market correction. In North America, the positive pricing trends in the third quarter continued, in fact improved in several areas, particularly in our major accounts, retail and E&S wholesale divisions. Overall, rates in North America were up about 2.5%, the same as last quarter, while renewal price change, which includes exposure, was up 4%. Retention of our customers remained strong across all of our North America commercial and personal P&C businesses. Renewal retention is measured by premium of nearly 92%. In major accounts in specialty which doesn't include agriculture, premiums were up 5%. Rates for major accounts were up over 3 with risk management at rates of less than 1%, while excess casualty rates were up 10%, property was up 12% and public D&O was up 8.5%.","In our Westchester specialty business, rates were up 4.5%. In our North American middle-market and small commercial, premiums overall were up over 4.5% the quarter, our best growth in many quarters. New business was up almost 14% with a meaningful percentage of that coming from growth initiatives. Renewal retention in our middle-market business was 90%, middle-market pricing which includes rate and exposure change was up 2.5%. In our U.S. small commercial business, premium revenue continued its positive growth momentum with net premiums up almost 30%.","In our North America personal lines business, net premiums in the quarter declined 2.5%. In the quarter, we added California to our existing homeowners quota share treaty, effective 10\/1. And this impacted growth by 4.2 points. Excluding premiums paid to reinsurers, premiums were up 2.3%. Retention remained very-strong at about 96%. Homeowners pricing was up 7.5% in the quarter, which included again, both rate and exposure change. Our North American agriculture business had a very good year, highlighted by a full-year combined ratio of 75.5%, which is about flat with prior of 74%. Our crop insurance business is a great franchise and we are the clearly leaders.","Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, a $10 billion business. As I mentioned, we experienced excellent growth this quarter in our international P&C division. Net premiums written for our international retail division were up 8% in constant dollars and FX then had a negative impact of 4.5 points. This compared favorably to year-to-date constant dollar growth of about 6%. Growth was broad-based. Asia-Pacific and the Latin America grew 10% and 8.5% respectively, while the Continent was up over 5%, UK-Ireland was up 4%. We benefited from our growth initiatives and improved price environment, in certain markets, particularly London and Australia.","Net premiums for our commercial P&C lines overall, international retail were up 8.5% in the quarter with strong growth in particular coming from our middle-market and small commercial initiatives. Net premiums for our London market wholesale business were up 12% in the quarter in constant dollars. This business is growing again, on the back of improved pricing after several years of shrinking. It\u2019s an excellent example of how Chubb is nimble and can quickly take advantage of changing and dynamic market conditions. As for pricing conditions outside the U.S., rates in our international retail and London wholesale business vary by line and by country.","Overall, rates in our retail were up 4%, the best in some time, though concentrated in a few countries and lines of business. For example, property was up 5% and professional lines were up 7%. Rates in our London wholesale business were up 10%. International personal lines premiums were up 8.5% in constant dollar, driven again by Asia and Latin America with growth of 19.5% and 9.5%, respectively.","And finally, our Asia life insurance business had an excellent year with premium revenue of $2.4 billion and earnings of over $100 million. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade and Ed Clancy can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends.","In summary, Chubb performed quite well, despite a quarter of greater short-tail volatility. We have a good momentum and it\u2019s continuing to build in terms of executing on our growth initiatives and taking advantage of an improving pricing and underwriting environment in the U.S., London a few important territories. Our organization is optimistic about the year ahead, and we are off to a good start.","With that, I'll turn over to Phil and then we\u2019re going to come back and take your questions.","Phil Bancroft","Thank you, Evan.","We completed the year with a strong balance sheet and an excellent overall financial position with total capital of over $63 billion. Even with significant catastrophe loss payments, our operating cash flow was quite strong at $1.6 billion for the quarter and $5.5 billion for the year.","During the quarter, we returned $654 million to shareholders including $336 million in dividends and $318 million in share repurchases. For the year, we returned over $2.3 billion to shareholders, equaling 54% of our earnings, including over $1.3 billion in dividends and over $1 billion in share repurchases. Also, during the year, we issued $2.2 billion of debt in the European markets, paid off $1 billion of debt that matured throughout the year, and redeemed $1 billion of hybrid securities, which together, reduced our annual interest expense run rate by approximately $47 million.","Net realized and unrealized losses for the quarter were $958 million after-tax, which included $383 million of losses in the investment portfolio, reflecting the widening of credit spreads on corporate fixed income securities late in the quarter, partially offset by declining interest rates. Since December 31st, the mark-to-market gain on the portfolio is in excess of $900 million. We also had unrealized losses of $205 million related to the annual review of our retirement benefit plans and mark to market loss of $263 million on our variable annuity portfolio, principally driven by a decline in the equity markets, and $95 million loss from FX. Since December 31st, the mark on VA portfolio is a gain on $65 million.","Since the Chubb acquisition, we have reduced our dilution on tangible book value per share from 29% to 9%, an improvement of 20 percentage points. Since December 31st, the dilution improved to 6%, based on market movements in the portfolio. If we had included the fair value mark on our private equity portfolio in our operating income as others do, core operating ROE for the year would have been 9.5% compared to the reported 8.7%. Our adjusted net investment income for the quarter was above our expected range due principally to higher private equity distributions and higher reinvestment rates.","While there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, including interest rates and private equity distributions, we now expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to be in the range of $880 million to $890 million. We had a favorable prior period development in the quarter of $253 million pretax or $202 million after-tax. This includes pretax favorable prior period development from our legacy runoff exposures of $22 million, comprising adverse development of $108 million, principally related to asbestos, offset by a favorable reinsurance settlement of $130 million. The remaining favorable development of $231 million was split approximately 60% from long-tail lines, principally accident years 2013 and prior, and 40% from short-tail lines.","On a constant dollar basis, net loss reserves decreased $661 million for the year, reflecting the impact of catastrophe loss payments and the impact of favorable prior period development. On a reported basis, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 102% for the year. After adjusting for the items noted above, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 93%. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.1%, driven in part by catastrophe losses, which were incurred in lower tax jurisdictions, as previously disclosed.","Our full-year operating effective tax rate was 14.4%, in line with our range of 13% to 15%. For 2019, we expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%. There has been a report that the tax deductibility of our intercompany debt will be affected by the provisions of the tax law that impact hybrid debt. That is not true.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Karen.","Karen Beyer","Thank you. At this point we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. Evan, you mentioned that the larger property loss in commercial line, you considered one-off. Can you give a little bit more details, what gives you confidence it\u2019s one-off rather than a trend?","Evan Greenberg","There is just variability -- there was a variability of frequency in North America larger losses in a very short period of time. I mean, it\u2019s just a deviation, and it wasn't a huge number of losses but it has an impact. And, there is nothing we see in the underwriting that leads us to believe, and there is nothing we see in data that leads us to believe that\u2019s trend. It\u2019s just you can have quarter-to-quarter volatility, and we had more volatility. So, that\u2019s what I can tell you. And beyond that, we've been -- short-tail lines need rate. And we have been achieving rate full year, actually began in \u201817, and that continues into the first quarter and that too has an ameliorating impact. And in fact, we are achieving rate that achieves or exceeds trend. So, that\u2019s all beneficial.","Kai Pan","My second question on the catastrophe losses. You mentioned that without catastrophe, your ROE would have been 9.8% for the year versus 8.7%. So, my calculation points to probably -- implies 4 points of normal CAT load. I just want to make sure my math is right. And also, given the elevated losses last few years, do you think that that\u2019s still a good run rate going forward? Are you taking any actions in terms of reinsurance coverage potentially could mitigate the CAT exposure?","Evan Greenberg","We\u2019re constantly managing our portfolio and it\u2019s dynamic in terms of how we protect. And so, I\u2019m not going to give any forward-looking on that. But, that\u2019s something that we constantly are engaged in Kai. And as far as what to expect, look, we work on longer range period than just a couple of years and looking at what's expected CAT. So, the last two years have been elevated. People have short memories. I'll remind you that the four or five years prior to that, had far lower CATs. And yet we don\u2019t adjust the number of expected down to that; you're using a longer-term average, 10 to 15 years. The most recent years become a part of that average. And so, they reflect that experience for both modeled, and the way you project non-modeled and put a factor on that as well. And so, that's what informs how we look at CAT loss over a longer period. And so, it has more stability to the expected number.","It\u2019s just editorialize one step further to imagine that well, the last two years, now climate change has arrived and boy, this is the new normal. Well, what would you have said about the four or five years prior to that? I think, it\u2019s simplistic thinking to imagine on that basis. I think, longer term averages have a bit more stability to them. It\u2019s sort of like the same as looking at quarterly result variability in short-tail versus looking at the annual current accident number, which is a far more credible number.","Operator","We will hear next from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse.","Mike Zaremski","Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up to the question on the CAT load. Given, there was a merger that took place, do you know -- could you tell us what your 10 to 15-year average has been? Because the math that some of us have done here points to the 10 to 15-year average being 30% or so above what your expectation was in 2018 in terms of the CAT load?","Phil Bancroft","Well, I don't know what your math is; I can't comment on that. I only know how we do our own math and to imagine modeled and non-modeled loss. So, what I can\u2019t do is on this call engage in here is my math versus your math. But, you are free to call us and tell us about your math. And while some of this we disclose, some we don't, we\u2019ll discuss it with you.","Mike Zaremski","And so, my next question is regarding relationship of commercial P&C pricing versus loss trends. We always appreciate your insights\u2026","Phil Bancroft","By the way, I\u2019m confident in my math. I just thought I\u2019d put that out to you. But, go ahead. ","Mike Zaremski","Okay. That\u2019s fair. So, yes, regarding pricing versus loss trend on the commercial side, we\u2019re always trying to parse whether you feel the -- clearly improving rate environment is largely due to just the industry reacting to higher loss trends or do you feel that Chubb could potentially see some margin improvement, if commercial rate environment hovers around the current levels?","Evan Greenberg","No, I don\u2019t see an improvement.","Mike Zaremski","That\u2019s simple answer. And maybe one quick follow-up to that, some -- is number of [multiple speakers]. That\u2019s fair. One more in, a lot of management teams including yourself have talked about a more legal -- active legal bar, and some teams have also talked about the rise of third-party capital backing lawsuits, some people call litigation finance or finding. Do you think that having -- that asset class is having impact on the insurance industry\u2019s loss trends?","Evan Greenberg","On the margin, I think only on the margin.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will hear from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question is going back to where Kai was asking about the higher non-CAT property losses in commercial lines. I know you made the comment that it seemed just due to the variability to be a one-off quarter. Did you see non-CAT property elevated in any of the other quarters of \u201818? And then, could you also give us a sense -- I know it\u2019s only one month and we\u2019re just into February. Do you have a sense that the level of losses reverted back to normal in January?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. The answer on January is, yes. But Jesus, it\u2019s one month and hardly a credible period. And to answer your other question, it was basically fourth quarter. We saw little bit in late third quarter occur, and then it was fourth quarter. And January, sure -- but that's a fool's game. And by the way, Elyse, you\u2019re really -- when you\u2019re looking at something like property, and let\u2019s keep in prospective, we write -- what, in North America about $4 billion -- sorry, about $2.4 billion of property business. So, a very large portfolio, we have a lot of experience with it. The variability quarter-to-quarter is not that unusual. Obviously, it's a short period of time. It's not that credible. The annual period is far more credible. Anyway, I think I\u2019ve answered your questions. And please don't take one month of January, better as well; it was -- it\u2019s a month.","Elyse Greenspan","I get that. That was helpful. And then, in terms of homeowners, you pointed during your prepared remarks, it takes time for with the states to get the rates into the system. Would you expect to start to see the margin improve in the first quarter or is that something that we should start to think about seeing more of the underlying margin improvement coming later in 2019.","Phil Bancroft","We were pretty clear when we talked about it in the third quarter to you that it would be something in the latter part of \u201819, we should begin to see it come through on a run rate basis, all things being equal.","Elyse Greenspan","And then, my last numbers question, you guys bought more reinsurance timely for in California this year, at the start of the quarter. Can you give us a sense of your gross losses for the California fires? And then, how did the gross loss in 2018 compared to the gross losses that you guys saw from the fires in 2017?","Evan Greenberg","We didn\u2019t -- and it was really a miscommunication in here. We didn't publish a CAT page but we are going to give you a CAT page and put one out to you, so you can see by CAT how it breaks down, and we're giving you the net. The gross number is not applicable really to an investor's view of the company, and that is what impacts our balance sheet and financial statement. And so, we will give you what you need for that.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear next from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","I was hoping you could maybe just add on to the high net worth environment. We still seem to have -- personal lines front -- we seem to have still a large number of new entrants into that market. I\u2019m just interested if there's been any really change in that competitive environment, seeing how it does feel like there is a lot of folks that are announcing new efforts?","Evan Greenberg","I\u2019ll ask Paul Krump to comment on that. From my point of view, we don't see a change of any consequence in the competitive environment over the last year. It\u2019s pretty stable that way. You get new entrants who come in and they are particularly in the mass affluent category, not the true high net worth. They don't have the coverages and the services and the capabilities to really manage that market. And when they come in, they got one thing to offer in a segment of the market that is I would say, in some ways -- it\u2019s the price-sensitive end of the market. And in there where coverage matters or service matters less, on that one way and that\u2019s to under price the business. But we\u2019ve seen that for a while and it\u2019s on the margin. But, Paul, do you want\u2026","Paul Krump","Evan, I agree with everything you just said. Just to try to put some more color around it. Our retention in the homeowners and PRS space is 96%, it\u2019s actually even better on the high net worth, the real wealthy homes, what will recall premier and signature. So, we do lose a couple of customers through that, and we\u2019re trying to figure out how to stop that but can\u2019t. So, I can\u2019t -- maybe on two hands I could count the number of accounts that we lost to any new entrants in the last 12 months. They are definitely going after the low-end of the market. And if you look at the writings, I think you'd be shocked that how little traction they are getting in new market. It really is a service game and agents and brokers are very conscious of that. It\u2019s not just one-off fire loss they worry about, they worry about what happens in the big capitals and then there are hundreds if not thousands of claims to handle.","Evan Greenberg","And I would say this. We don\u2019t -- we're not arrogant about it, we\u2019re not at rest about it. It\u2019s like everything else in the world. Service has to constantly improve; your standards of service must constantly improve. Coverages have to be constantly improved. You\u2019ve to be able to offer more choice to customers. Some who want to buy a full boat of coverage and some who want to buy something a little later. And you\u2019ve got to be able to do this in a digital world where the customer service and experience represents that. And the same thing with marketing and sales. And we\u2019re continuing to iterate and crank up our capabilities in all of those areas because we think there is -- and remains a large opportunity in this marketplace.","Paul Newsome","And second, I wanted to ask about the accident health business. We haven't talked about that in quite some time. At one point it was a huge focus for the old Chubb to have it, I think as much as 25% of the revenue\u2026","Evan Greenberg","I think you mean\u2026","Paul Newsome","You\u2019re right. And I was curious is that -- is it still an idea to have or a goal to have that kind of high percentage of the -- in each business in the new combined entity?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. When you look at -- which I know you did, our investor deck and you look at growth lines, and I believe from memory, 31% on pie chart that would grow high single to double digit, you saw the accident health business as one of those areas of business. And in Asia and Latin America and in North America, in particular, the growth rate is improving in that business and will continue to improve in \u201819. And a lot of the distribution that we have, deals that we have made over the last year, including what we just announced as Banco de Chile, will directly benefit that accident and health business. And so, it is a growth area for the Company. And our objective is to increase because if it is growing at high single to double-digit, it will increase -- continue to increase as a percentage of our total business. Because it\u2019s a specialty and a capability of ours; it\u2019s deep in our DNA. And by the way, whether it is in the combined, in the U.S. where we reinvented in our growing, our worksite benefits businesses, it\u2019s now $150 million premium from nothing that\u2019s growing at serious double-digit to serving the lower middle income with -- to grab, which is the largest -- which is the Uber of Southeast Asia or DBS\u2019s customer or Banamex\u2019s customers or Banco de Chile or many other sponsors that we have on a direct marketing and digital basis, it\u2019s the full boat.","Operator","Moving next to Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Yaron Kinar","Two questions on North America commercial. So, the first, I just want to confirm that the 1.4% impact from adverse property claims experience or loss experience, that\u2019s consolidated, right?","Evan Greenberg","Consolidated?","Phil Bancroft","On total P&C.","Yaron Kinar","Total P&C, sorry. ","Evan Greenberg","Sorry. Yes on total P&C. Yes, we did post the number.","Yaron Kinar","So, if my math is correct, it would suggest that the accident year loss ratio excluding the elevated property office actually improved year-over-year. And if that is correct, could you maybe talk about what's led to that improvement? Is it earned rates, is it something else that\u2019s driving that?","Evan Greenberg","Are you saying the accident loss ratio on the total business?","Yaron Kinar","No, on North America commercial, excluding the property deterioration.","Evan Greenberg","Excluding the property deterioration, and are you looking at the combined ratio or the loss ratio?","Yaron Kinar","No. The accident year loss ratio for North America commercial.","Evan Greenberg","We will take that offline with you and go through that with you. I'm not sure I'm completely relating to that number, the way you\u2019re saying it. And it would be very modest and it would be likely mixed related. But before I jump to that we\u2019ll take that off line with you.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then, my second question on North America commercial, Evan, in your comments, you talked about the rate increases. It sounds to me like you may be actually leading the rate increases here, maybe a little bit above industry here. And if that is the case, would you expect that to impact the growth -- the top line growth over the next few quarters as maybe the industry tries to catch up?","Evan Greenberg","A couple of things. One, the industry -- I would glue it together this way. You saw the fourth quarter growth rate. And in January, our growth relative to our own plans was good. And we were on or over or exceeded our plan in the first -- in the month of January. You don\u2019t know our plan and we don\u2019t disclose it. And, we got better rate in January or the same rate; it varied by line that we -- particularly in North America and in our wholesale business that we saw in the fourth quarter. And our renewal retention is good. So that implies to me the industry environment is improving as well. And you have a couple of things going on. You have not just driving for rate but you companies reacting to the loss environment, to the pressure by reducing limits in areas or competitors depends on the area withdrawing from a line of business. That starts to -- that plays with the supply-demand part of the dynamic of the market. Okay? So, you\u2019re only thinking just in terms of rate. And that\u2019s why it is trying to signal that there is more than that going on. But, you see our retention rates, you see our business, and yet we\u2019re pressing for rate adequacy. Anyway, I think, that's the best way I can explain it to you.","Operator","Jay Gelb from Barclays, your line is open.","Jay Gelb","Based on the commentary that Chubb is off to a good start in 2019, and if I look back over the past three years, there is remarkably stable underlying accident year combined ratio. Given the pricing is improving, should we expect that trend on the accident year combined to be the same in 2019, the same or better as 2018?","Evan Greenberg","I wouldn't look for an improvement. What I have said is that remarkably stable. Remarkably stable rate on some of the business, particularly in short-tail is achieving or exceeding trend, which it needs to do, which is beneficial. In long-tail lines, it varies. There are many classes where rate is not keeping pace with loss cost trend. We constantly are exercising portfolio management, used reinsurance and mix, and so therefore mix of business to balance it. But, this is a risk business. And I wouldn't imagine -- and I don't imagine that you just pick a combined ratio and that's a static number. It has variability around it. And so, I would say, what you see is what you get within a reasonable range of deviation. That\u2019s all.","Jay Gelb","Right, of course, okay. And then, separately, given the strong operating cash flow for full-year 2018, I believe you said around $5.5 billion, what would you quantify as Chubb\u2019s excess capital position as of year-end? ","Phil Bancroft","What we have said is that the impact of the excess capital on a full-year basis would strip about 0.5 point off of our ROE. So, you can do the math.","Jay Gelb","I hope so.","Phil Bancroft","I trust you buddy.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear next from Brian Meredith from UBS.","Brian Meredith","Just first one, Phil, I\u2019m just curios, tax rate guidance; it looks like it\u2019s actually up a little bit on year-over-year basis. Is there anything to that; is it just mix business, something else going on geographically?","Phil Bancroft","There is two things. One is, in the past two years, we\u2019ve had some compensated related deductions, and we don't expect them -- compensation related deductions that we don\u2019t expect to recur. And we\u2019re going to have lower tax exempt income. We\u2019ve sold about $4.4 billion of our municipal bond portfolio. And as we look at the after-tax yields, we would expect that some of that will continue. Remember, that doesn\u2019t take away from our income because our after-tax yield is going to be higher based on the judgment to sell the munies.","Brian Meredith","Got it, makes sense. And then, I noticed that administrative expenses on a year-over-year basis were actually down this quarter. Was that FX-driven, was there anything else going on?","Phil Bancroft","It\u2019s principally just timing, as we look at it. There is nothing specific that I would point to, it\u2019s just going to be variable and it\u2019s a timing issue.","Brian Meredith","And just lastly, Evan, on the small commercial property thing. If I take a look at your North American commercial, your underlying combined ratio for the year was pretty much flat to down modestly. Is that the way we should kind of think about how the business is going to perform? And you\u2019ll have some ups and downs every quarter, I assume.","Evan Greenberg","Yes. You should think about it and you can see it, if you look at past years. There is a variability -- there is a little more in this quarter than it is in the recent quarters. But, you\u2019ll have some variability by the nature of the business. It\u2019s a risk business. So, that can just happen. Of course, we\u2019re underwriters. And when we see a spike in something, we take a pretty close look. We want to know what an early -- what that\u2019s telling us and is it -- is there something that is changed in our business or is it just a natural variability that you continue. But we more judge then on a longer period and at an annual period of time it\u2019s a more stable measure obviously than one three-month period. And so, again when we look at this, we judge it from everything we can see as just a deviation around the mean, and the annual was more stable period. Look, I expect and it doesn't surprise me, given the nature of the business. It\u2019s a risk business that you see some variability.","Brian Meredith","I just want to make sure because if you strip out that\u2026","Evan Greenberg","Casualty? I got to tell you, I have a whole different view [multiple speakers] one-off large loss of some kind. But, if I saw a frequency or casualty, that\u2019s a whole different story.","Brian Meredith","That makes sense, because you strip out that large loss all of a sudden, your underlying combined ratio in North America looks way down on a year-over-year basis. And I just want to make sure, that\u2019s not kind of way to model off of.","Evan Greenberg","Yes. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way. And we will take it offline and do some work with you about those.","Operator","We will hear next from Meyer Shields from KBW.","Meyer Shields","I just wanted to follow up on Brian\u2019s question, we saw particularly lower admin expenses year-over-year in North America commercial and personal. Is that also just randomness or is there some connection to the elevated losses?","Evan Greenberg","No, no connection to the elevated losses. It is a randomness, quarter-to-quarter. ","Meyer Shields","And Evan, I was hoping you could take us through the thought process of buying more quota share protection in California homeowners over excess?","Evan Greenberg","Well, we -- it benefited the Company. Look, we wanted to reduce our exposure and balance our exposure in California where we have a lot of concentration in both CAT and non- CAT modeled and non-modeled CAT. We did -- the quarter share was initially purchased for the New England states and the Northeast where we had -- we have an usual amount of concentration. We weren\u2019t simply trying to balance CAT but the exposures of non-modeled CAT is well like, just frequency of winter losses that you had in the Northeast and the impact it could have on the total book when we put all these books together. So, it was really looking for to spread the risk of the ground up concentration, not simply a single event concentration, or the losses produced because of the concentration from a single event. And that was the reason for purchasing the Northeast quota share. And it made sense to us to extend that then to California as well. And we gave the reinsurers a better balance; they were concentrated in just one territory.","Operator","Larry Greenberg from Janney Montgomery Scott, your line is now open. ","Larry Greenberg","My question also is on the underlying and commercial North America, and you\u2019ve probably given me enough to answer it. But I\u2019m going to still ask... ","Evan Greenberg","Then, why you\u2019re asking me, Larry.","Larry Greenberg","Because I\u2019m not sure if I know the answer. But, let me just ask it this way. The underlying loss ratio deteriorated by about 60 bps for the year. And over the course of the year, you've called out some things, you actually called out some things last year as well. But, would you say the 60 bps is fairly representative of the price versus lost trends in the business?","Evan Greenberg","Perfect, perfect.","Larry Greenberg","Okay, thanks.","Evan Greenberg","There is gravity. Yes.","Larry Greenberg","Okay. And then, the expense ratio improved more this year than at least I was thinking. And I would say, maybe you guys had indicated coming out of last year. And is that just kind of operating leverage in the business, are there any other explanations to discuss there?","Evan Greenberg","Larry, there is -- I\u2019m going to give you three answers. Number one, we had the runoff, if you will, of all the projects we have put in place since the merger. And those had some runoff final benefits that emerged in the year. We have a constant expense control in here. And yes, there is one-off items that benefit the expense ratio during the year. But, every year we have one-off items. They vary by quarter and that sort of thing. But, there always seems to be a number of them; it\u2019s just the nature of the business. So, but the first two I gave you are really the enduring drivers of it. Expense ratio is part of strategy.","Operator","And at this time, we do have time for one final question and that final question will come from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, Ryan.","Ryan Tunis","Just a couple for Evan. I guess, first of all, thinking about casualty line in North America commercial, how do you feel about loss trend today versus maybe a year ago? Do you feel like there is more pressure, is the pressure alleviated some?","Evan Greenberg","It\u2019s about stable. We haven't seen -- over the last year, we haven't seen a change in loss trend from...","Ryan Tunis","Is it still mostly limited to the management liability lines or have you seen it creep at all into excess casualty or...","Evan Greenberg","No, not -- the way you\u2019re asking it, I want to make sure we have clarity here. What you're asking about change in loss trend, and I'm responding to change in loss trend but -- and that\u2019s stable. But, there is a loss trend to every line of casualty. I mean, I could tell you that middle-market, our comp business, the frequency is stable, so is the loss -- the severity trend but it has a trend of calling our book of over 5 points -- 5%. So, it\u2019s real. Excess casualty, excess casualty has a loss trend to it, whether it's major account or it\u2019s middle-market, all casualty does. And so, loss costs go up every year. But, the trend is stable.","Ryan Tunis","The trend is stable. Got you. And on the personal line side, I appreciate it\u2019s going to take some time for your rate increases to earn in. But, would you say the loss activity has -- is that still getting worse at this point and you\u2019re still kind of trying to pin that down...","Evan Greenberg","No. I would say and we were just looking at it yesterday, looking month by month actuals versus expected. The frequency and severity, average severities by cause of loss, we believe they have stabilized; we\u2019re seeing it stabilized. We're not still trying to get a handle on it. It has stabilized, we see it. And it is a clear trend we have seen for a period of time. And so, we know the target we\u2019re shooting at.","Operator","And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to your host, Karen Beyer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Karen Beyer","Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you and have a good day.","Operator","That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation."],"5106":["Chubb Ltd.

Today's conference is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Helen M. Wilson - Chubb Ltd.","Thank you, and welcome to our March 31, 2018 first quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, economic and market conditions. These are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our most recent SEC filings, earnings press release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.","We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement, which are available at investors.chubb.com.","Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.","And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Good morning. We reported first quarter operating income of $2.34 per share, down about 5.5% from prior year. Our results were impacted by natural catastrophe losses, which were up $175 million pre-tax over prior. CATs in the quarter were concentrated in two geographic regions where we're strong. Montecito, California, an affluent community with the mudslides, and the Northeast with the winter storms.","CATs aside, we had an excellent quarter, highlighted by world-class underwriting performance, strong net investment income results and good premium revenue growth in many of our businesses, particularly in the U.S. and a number of important classes, while at the same time achieving improved rate increases.","Core operating income excluding CATs in prior period reserve development was $2.63 per share versus $2.50 prior year, up over 5%. Book and tangible book value were up slightly in the quarter since we were impacted by the mark from a rise in interest rates. That's actually a good thing, since it speaks to improved future investment income earning power.","Our annualized core operating ROE in the quarter was 8.7% or 9.7% with an expected level of CATs. We reported a P&C combined ratio of 90.1%, which included 5.8 points of CATs. On a current accident year basis, excluding catastrophes, the P&C combined ratio was 87.6% and an improvement over prior year.","For your information, the current accident year combined ratio with an expected level of CATs, my preferred measure, was 90.7% versus 91.2% prior year. Net investment income was $877 million, up 5% over prior year. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, the catastrophes and prior period development.","Turning to market conditions in the quarter, commercial P&C pricing for the business we wrote continued to improve in the U.S. and most territories outside the U.S. At the same time, our renewal retention rates overall were good and new business, particularly in the U.S., was up. In some classes, customer segments and territory, we are seeing a clear direction and momentum in price firming. In others, it's more chaotic, as some companies, particularly those with experience in a class, moved for needed rate, while others less experienced were simply lacking leadership moved for growth at the expense of rate adequacy, a short-term strategy.","Given the variability in rates by customer segment and territory, and to give you greater clarity into current market conditions, I'm going to provide a fair amount of pricing detail by our five major lines of business. P&C net premium revenue growth for the company was 5.8% for the quarter or 3.5% in constant dollars. And given all I know, I fully expect that growth rate to continue to improve, particularly outside the U.S., as the year goes along.","In our U.S. major account retail and E&S wholesale division, what we call Major Accounts and Specialty, P&C net written premiums were up 3.5%. Excluding merger-related actions, net premiums were up 6%. As I noted last quarter, merger-related actions are now almost all behind us and of the $150 million we will take this year, $48 million, or over 30% occurred in the first quarter.","For major accounts, our renewal retention in the quarter was 95%. New business in major accounts was up 14%. Let me give you some examples of both rate and its movement during the quarter in Major and Specialty. Again, for the business we wrote in major accounts, rates overall were up 1.9% for the quarter, double what we achieved in the fourth quarter, and by March, they were up 4%.","Property rates were up 13% in the quarter, casualty rates and risk management primary casualty were up 1.5%, while in general and specialty casualty, rates were up over 3%, both the best in some time. In the quarter, rates for major accounts professional lines overall turned positive, the first time in some time, with primary and first access D&O rates up 2.3%; not what we want, but a move in the right direction.","In E&S wholesale, rates overall were up 5% for the quarter and improving to 6% in March. Property rates were up 8% in the quarter. Casualty was up 4% and financial lines rates were up 2.5%.","Now let's turn to our middle market business where P&C net written premiums were up 3.5% and financial lines premiums were down 0.5%. Overall renewal retention was 88% and new business growth for our middle market business was up 6%. Middle market P&C rates overall excluding comp were up 1%, and exposure growth added an additional 1%, the best in a number of quarters. Property was up 1%, casualty related was up 2% and package was flat.","Comp rates were down about 4.5 points, while comp-related exposure was up about 3. So net pricing for middle market comp was down about 1.5. Middle market professional lines rates were up with public D&O up 6% and private, not-for-profit D&O up 1%. In middle market overall, rates in March were the strongest of the quarter in virtually every line.","In our North America personal lines business, net written premiums were up 6.5% in the quarter. Rates were up 2.5%, the strongest increase in many quarters. Exposure change added an additional 3.5%. Retention remained very strong at 96.5% and we are achieving a better mix of business in personal lines, with new business and renewals skewing towards true high net worth as opposed to mass affluent.","Now, turning to our Overseas General Insurance operations, net written premiums for our international retail P&C were up 8.5% or 2% in constant dollars. We fully expect growth will meaningfully accelerate from the second quarter onward. Asia-Pacific and Latin America grew 10% and 4%, respectively in the quarter, while the Continent was down 2.5% and UK was up 1.5%, all in constant dollar.","In international retail, rates varied by line and region and by country within region. Overall, rates were up 1%; while not stellar, the best we've seen in a few years. Property rates were up 3% and varied between up 12% in Latin America to down 2% in the UK. Financial lines rates were up 1%, ranging between up 4% in the UK and Asia to flat on the Continent and in Latin America. Casualty rates were flat and marine was down, though it varied between up 8% in the UK to down 3% in Asia.","Of the major markets in the world overall, the market that remains most disappointing is the UK in both wholesale and retail, with the exception of D&O, which is beginning to firm like it is in the U.S., Australia and a few other markets.","Our global A&H business had a good quarter with net premiums up 8%, driven by our international business, which was up about 12% or almost 6% followed \u2013 in constant dollar followed by our combined insurance business in North America, which was up 8%. Meanwhile in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums and deposits were up 17% in the quarter. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends.","In the quarter, we announced a distribution partnership with Singapore-based Grab, the leading on-demand transportation company in Southeast Asia, with operations in 8 countries. This is another example of Chubb's efforts to advance our distribution capabilities.","In closing, we're off to a very good start to the year. Our heavier CATs, catastrophe activity impacted our financial results, it's the business we're in and they have not slowed down our operational or strategic progress. We achieved better pricing and growth momentum is building in a number of important businesses. Our people are 100% focused on what we do best; underwriting, marketing, selling and servicing.","Beyond our hallmark as an underwriting company, we are first in the service business and our brand is all about providing exceptional service. In that regard, in case you didn't see it, J.D. Power recently ranked Chubb number two in overall customer satisfaction for homeowners' property claims behind Amica Mutual. National Underwriter in its nationwide Risk Manager Choice Award awarded Chubb top honors as the best commercial insurance provider. Chubb was also ranked number one in commercial claims satisfaction by brokers and risk managers according to Advisen. We are grateful for the votes of confidence from our customers and distribution partners.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then, we'll be back to take your questions.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","Thank you, Evan. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong, with total capital of $66 billion. Our portfolio of cash and high-quality investments totaled $104 billion and we have capital generating power.","As I'm sure Evan will tell you, we are retaining capital for risk and flexibility for future opportunities and we are extremely patient. Overall, liquidity is excellent and even with the negative portfolio mark-to-market in the quarter caused by rising interest rates, we remain in an unrealized gain position.","In 2018 to date, S&P and Fitch have affirmed our group ratings with stable outlooks, and Moody's has affirmed these ratings with a positive outlook.","Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $332 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and paid off $300 million of debt that matured in March. We also issued $2.2 billion of debt in the European market that was used to redeem the $1 billion of floating rate hybrid securities on April 6 and we're going to repay at maturity senior debt, totaling $1.2 billion due through 2019.","Net investment income for the quarter was $877 million, which was just over the top of the expected range due to increased call activity in the company's corporate bond portfolio. Our expected quarterly investment income run rate is now in the range of $875 million to $885 million, with a continuing upward trajectory throughout the year.","Operating cash flow in the quarter was $550 million, which included over $500 million of catastrophe loss payments. Operating cash flow together with the proceeds from our $2.2 billion debt offering will help support the growth in investment income.","Book and tangible book value per share remained essentially unchanged from last quarter as core operating income and the positive impact of foreign exchange were offset by the net realized and unrealized losses for the quarter of $586 million after tax. This amount includes an unrealized loss of $988 million from the investment portfolio due to rising interest rates, partially offset by a $310 million gain from FX and a $60 million mark-to-market gain on our VA portfolio.","Pre-tax net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $380 million, as previously announced, and are further detailed in our financial supplement. We had positive prior period development in the quarter of $209 million pre-tax or $166 million after tax. This included $106 million pre-tax favorable development related to the 2017 CAT events and $76 million pre-tax favorable development related to the 2017 crop year loss estimates.","Our net loss reserves are in good shape and reflect our conservative reserving philosophy of reacting early to bad news and waiting to reflect good news on long tail lines until we are comfortable that the accident period has sufficiently matured. Net loss reserves were flat in the quarter and decreased by $300 million on a constant dollar basis, reflecting the impact of the favorable prior period development and a high level of catastrophe and crop insurance payments in the quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 103% in the quarter. Adjusting for these items, the ratio was 91%.","Other operating expense improved $9 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher than expected income from our equity method investments that are included in core operating income. Adjusted interest expense was $169 million pre-tax in the quarter. Factoring in the new year (00:17:39) debt issued in March and the repayment of the $1 billion hybrids in April, we expect our quarterly adjusted interest expense to be approximately $165 million pre-tax per quarter for the remainder of the year.","The 2017 tax reform act favorably impacted the expected range of our annual tax rate by 3 points. Our current estimate remains in the range of 13% to 15%. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 12%, which was lower than our expected range, primarily due to the level of U.S. catastrophe events in the quarter.","I'll turn the call back to Helen.","Helen M. Wilson - Chubb Ltd.","Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. My first question, Evan, I appreciate all the disclosure in terms of the pricing environment. As you think out from here, if we see a combination of higher interest rates and if reinsurance rates start to go down at the upcoming mid-year renewal, do you think, in your mind, can the upward momentum continue in the primary insurance market?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","I don't see the change in interest rates. Those will all take time to earn in and make any kind of meaningful difference. So imagine the duration of invested asset when you think about rise in interest rates and how it \u2013 and the time it takes to cast a meaningful shadow on investment income. So I don't see that.","Secondly, the yield curve and interest rates starts speaking about inflation, so I keep that in mind. So, no, I don't see that. And in reinsurance, I think you're more thinking about CAT related, which is only a fraction of the reinsurance market, that everyone just remains obsessed about. And you've got to note that the balance of reinsurance, particularity in casualty-related, it didn't have a lot of firming to it, but it had some firming to it. And I don't see the mid-year as the big date for casualty-related reinsurance anyway.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And in your annual letter, you highlighted and spoke about the progress that you guys are making in building out your small commercial initiatives. Can you just provide us an update on where you sit today, where you see that business going? And as you guys think about potential acquisitions and deals that you might do, is this something that you see yourselves potentially building out those efforts via a deal or is the goal just continue to build that business organically?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Well, at this time, I just see us continuing to build that business organically. We are an extremely large player in middle market, particularly in the United States, where we're a leader in that business. We're in the top three. And that is, we have all the parts and pieces, and in fact, more than most any other company does. And it is simply in the execution of that, and we're on track as we see growth in that.","And then, our small commercial activities in the U.S., on the back of our strong agency distribution and branch network, the technology we've built and are deploying, and the underwriting insights that particularly we gain out of that middle market book of business we've got and all the product we filed and put in place, that business, even though you win it, $1,500 a customer, is growing robustly, and I'm confident that that will cast a meaningful shadow over time on the company's results.","And the same goes internationally. In selected markets throughout Asia and Latin America in particular, though beginning to occur in Europe, we've used the knowledge that we have within the organization, particularly gained through the merger, along with the presence, the strong presence we have around the world, and we are building distribution, and we are building product, and we are actively growing, and I got to tell you, one of the growth areas in international, major growth areas for us, along with A&H and consumer lines, is our middle market and small commercial business internationally. And we've already got a meaningful book and it's growing, and that business is robust.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you and one last question. You guys didn't buy back any stock in the quarter. The stock was obviously a bit cheaper than in the fourth quarter. Could you just update us on your view on buybacks and why you chose not to repurchase any stock in the first quarter?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You've mentioned sort of acquisitions and you've mentioned capital and buyback, and so why don't I glue all that together for you and kind of give one clear thought that maybe is on people's minds right now. Look, we are patient long-term builders and investors. Money does not burn a hole in our pocket and we retain capital for growth and risk. We've bought back now and again. But as you also noted in the shareholder letter and what we showed investors last fall, look at the return we achieved by deploying our capital intelligently for growth, organically and through acquisition, versus a look back if we had used it for buybacks. It created far greater value.","And I go a step further. Like many other asset classes, P&C assets are currently pricey, and at current prices don't generally make a lot of sense. Prices paid for recent transactions may make sense to others, but they don't for us. As we've said, any transaction that we do must advance strategy in what we are doing already organically, while creating a good risk-adjusted return to shareholders, and I think our track record over the last 14 years speaks for itself in that regard.","So, again, we'll have capital flexibility, but we're patient and we'll wait for a different period.","Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning. I was hoping you could kind of address a big picture ROE question. I would imagine that at some point you'd like to have a very solidly double-digit ROE again. And I was wondering what you think are the \u2013 what is sort of the road map to get there over time for Chubb, given its current position and the current market environment.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Paul, I think you have to take a kind of picture view of this. First of all, on a normalized basis, we ran about a 9.7% ROE, surplus capital right now, scrubs about three quarters of a point off our ROE. So we're in double-digit on a deployed capital.","Remember, if you \u2013 particularly when we did the acquisition, we have more goodwill on our balance sheet, that is income-producing asset, and that'll lower the ROE a little bit, and on a tangible basis, it accelerates, grows much more quickly. So I think you got to keep that in mind.","Number two, we told you before what 100 basis points of investment income improvement in the invested asset rate does for the company. It lifts the ROE 100 to 200 basis points. So you got to keep that in mind. And I'll stop right there.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","No, those are good pieces. I'm not criticizing the current ROE. I just figure there's probably a greater ambition in the future, but thank you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","We are ambitious.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning. So, I have a question. My first question is on the margin, underlying margin in North America and personal line. If you see other major segments, have seen improvements year-over-year, North America in personal line deteriorated about 140 basis points. What's the reason behind that? Any sort of non-CAT weather behind it?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","We're going to ask Paul Krump to take a shot at that. He manages that business, reports to it.","Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.","Morning, Kai. Thanks for the question. Yeah, just to level set for the other listeners, the personal lines current accident year loss ratio excluding CATs was 53.3% in Q1. That was up slightly from 52.4% in Q1 of last year. What we experienced here in the past quarter was moderately elevated losses over expected resulting from, number one, random larger fires, but then as you say, Kai, we experienced some elevated non-CAT weather. That's really mainly water coming from burst pipes just from the cold and then a lot of downed trees that type of thing on homes and busted windows and that type of \u2013 roofs and that type of thing. So, that's really what's driving it.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Could you quantify that impact?","Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.","Well, I did. Yeah.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. So my second question...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Kai, that was the increase in the loss ratio.","Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, right there.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's all of that, right? I just wonder is there underlying factors between pricing and the loss ratio.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You've got to put fire and water. I mean, there was no pestilence or vermin.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right, got it.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","(00:30:12) sometimes it's pretty simple.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure. Then my second question is on the loss trends and reserves. So, weather (00:30:19) trends you're seeing in the U.S. casualty lines? And if you look at your Schedule T data, it shows that your accident year loss ratio are all higher than the initial PICC in recent years. What's driving that development?","And also, in 2017, if you look at the accident year loss ratio for the other liability claims made, lines, those are lower than your initial and current PICC for the 2016, like a loss PICC. So, Evan, you talked about it in your annual letter that \u2013 you talk a lot about the rising frequency of class action suits. So, why is that 2017 PICC actually improved from the prior year?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Mouthful. You've thought about this one and we're really ready for it, Kai. I'm going to ask Paul O'Connell, our Chief Actuary to take a whack at this. Paul?","Paul O\u2019Connell - Chubb Ltd.","Okay. Thank you, Kai. First, I'm sure you're aware of the limitations of using Schedule T data for reserve analysis, especially for long-tail lines like other liability. The experiences is aggregated. It's an aggregation of many different product lines with different underlying characteristics, including development pattern. With respect to our recent accident year development, we analyze our reserves at a very granular level, well below the Schedule T product line. When you get down to that low level of detail, it's not surprising to see higher than expected reported losses in select portfolios early in the life of an accident year. As Phil stated in his commentary, for the most part, we react to bad news quickly and are patient and wait to react to good news only when we believe the accident year is sufficiently mature for the results to be credible. So that's what you're seeing in these product lines.","Specifically, with respect to the 2017 accident year for other liability claims made, the improvement in our loss ratio is due to underwriting actions on our part. Our portfolio management has led to a shift in mix among product lines, and within a product line a shift in classes of business. So that's really what's driving it.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Evan, could you comment further on the sort of like the class action litigation suits and what's the loss cost trend there?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","To maybe give you a little \u2013 yeah, we'll comment on that, but maybe to put it in perspective in professional lines for us. And then, if not satisfied, I'll go back and embellish on it. But I'm going to ask John Keogh to maybe comment on that a little bit for you.","John W. Keogh - Chubb Ltd.","Sure. Good morning, Kai. I think the first point I'd make, when you look at other claims made in liability, I think people sometimes go right to D&O as a proxy for that. There's a lot of business that makes up our financial lines book around the globe that's claims made. So, besides the fact that we have a large diversified business around the globe of D&O coverages, whether they're publicly traded, or private, or not-for-profit, that business also includes all sorts of lines of D&O coverages for our various services throughout the world, fidelity coverages, fiduciary and pension trust liability, employment practices liability, and a growing book of cyber-related coverages. And all of that is done in this big market with different at any moment in time loss cost patterns.","So let me just level set from that point of view. And as you can imagine, the way we run our business and the way we manage it is really dozens of very unique portfolios of this business that we have around the globe, where there's very granular underwriting analysis, underwriting results that we track, very distinct loss development, and we also look at the reserve adequacy of all these portfolios in a very unique way.","So, overall, when we look at that book of business around the globe, we feel pretty good that that business is running and performing adequately, and it's a very large and important book of business to us. However, I think to your question and to Evan's comments in his shareholder letter, that's really about some distinct areas of this portfolio, particularly in the D&O lines of business, where we are seeing some pressure, where loss costs in our opinion really are outpacing rates. And specifically, there I'd like to narrow it down to our D&O coverages for publicly traded businesses in North America, publicly traded businesses in the UK, and publicly traded business in Australia.","I'd also add to that when you look at our financial institutions business and the challenges that banks and financial institutions have in terms of the regulatory and compliance environment around the globe, loss cost there are concerns to us.","So I think if anything there, the underwriting actions that we need to take and the loss cost that we're observing and the rates that we need, we're pretty clear-eyed about what we need to do. Is it impacting us? Yeah, it's impacting us in our ability to grow that business. And in fact, if you look at that business in many parts of the portfolios I just mentioned, we're actually having to shrink the business because our \u2013 at least our perspective on the rate need that we have to get on that business isn't matching what others are willing to do. So, if anything, it's really been the challenge for us in terms of growing the business.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","I'm going to add one more thing to that specifically and that is the external environment. The external environment in some jurisdictions, and I'll take the United States, is growing more difficult, a number of merger-related suits, either overpaid or didn't pay enough. Every single one has \u2013 or almost all have a suit attached to it and the money is going to lawyers. It's not going to shareholders. In many cases, there's no money involved.","You look at \u2013 hashtag me, too, right now, and the growth and related suits from that, litigation funding is a growing trend and not simply for those who can't afford suits but as a class of investment. More law firms creating and chasing opportunity in the litigation space around securities related and spinning new theories. And so many of these, when you look at the size of companies and their balance sheets and you look at the size of transactions, mergers related, et cetera, the dollar values are so great that to get rid of the suits, these are nuisance suits in so many cases, and to get rid of them and rather than have to dwell on them or have them stand in the way of completing transactions, it's viewed by many corporations as nuisance money, and by the way, the legal profession knows that.","And so, they know that there's a tax they can employ and that the rate of tax, if it's not too great, they can have large frequency of it and just control that severity and make a boatload of money. And that is a problem, a growing problem in this country.","Thank you for the question.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you so much for all the answers.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I guess I wanted to take it a little bit of a different direction, but I thought the discussion in the annual letter was pretty interesting about the increase and the difficulty with dealing with non-modeled losses from a CAT standpoint. I guess looking at your expected level of CAT disclosure, I was just curious how are you thinking about the whole non-modeled angle with CATs and actually trying to project what you think you're expected level of CATs are? Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Well, I got to tell you, in your expected level of CATs, it's virtually your modeled level of CATs. I mean, that's what you can project. When we build our loss costs, we look at historic losses. And so when we build our rates, we build them off of our experience, which is \u2013 includes CATs, whether they were modeled or non-modeled, whether they are a CAT weather event or a non-CAT weather event because it doesn't rise the PCS's level to be named a CAT. It includes all non-weather and CAT related, so it includes all of your loss cost when you project, so you don't distinguish that way.","So the first thing is, that's how you think about it for rate, which I think is the most fundamental and important thing to think about. But separately, when we tend to \u2013 again, just reiterate, when we give you and \u2013 or when I think about expected CAT, it's the best I can do. It's what's expected. And so you can only take it out of your aggregation of exposure in areas that are exposed to catastrophes that have models around them and you can project the number. That's about it.","Better than what you can \u2013 better than excluding CAT that's for sure where you leave the freaking revenue in the denominator, take the losses out of the numerator and therefore, boy, you look like a hero, when you're just writing a tremendous amount of CAT-exposed business and you use it to subsidize the rest of your book. That's where I take exception, pretty much (00:41:16)","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Yeah, no, understood. So, at least it sounds like in that expected CAT number, you're taking a stab at other perils like wildfire and flood, right? Even if it's difficult to model, you're still thinking about that when you come up with that expected CAT level?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. And look, we're better at managing flood model today than we were a couple of years ago. You can't model though convective storms. So you can't model a tornado when that's going to occur or how it's going to occur, but our expected level of CAT, by the way, for a period does include spring storms for the spring. I just can't tell you where exactly.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","Fair enough. And then, shifting gears to actually personal lines. Obviously, we spend a lot of time talking about rate adequacy and commercial, and I guess, CATs there as well, but I guess as bigger picture, do we like the rate adequacy right now in the personal lines business? It's, I guess, just somewhere just below an 80% ex-CAT accident year combined. Is there a view that there's more \u2013 is that pricing adequate just given your view of normal catastrophe activity? Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. Ryan, that's a good question. Look, I would say our personal lines overall, we are \u2013 the pricing is adequate to us, and ex-auto and then with Auto. It varies by state and it varies by coverage, the adequacy. And so you've got to stay on top of this. You have to keep driving for rate or you get behind, particularly where you may not have the adequacy you want.","And then, I would say it further breaks down within a state of CAT exposed versus less CAT exposed, whether you're getting enough load or not, and we're very mindful of all of that when we go for growth because we want \u2013 and maintain exposure because we want and expect adequacy.","Loss cost in homeowners is not insignificant. There is an inflation in homeowners and you have to stay on top of that. In addition to rate you get an exposure adjustment with customers and unless you can control those loss costs by helping them with things like water shut off valves when pipes are breaking a lot and help them contain their loss that way, which we're driving to do to teach customers to lower their loss costs. Barring that, you've got to stay on top of it with exposure adjustment in addition to rate to maintain the overall adequacy that we have. So this is a work-intensive business that can get away from you if you don't stay on it.","Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research","That's very thorough and helpful. Thanks so much.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. I wanted to dig a little deeper, if I can, on the related topics of excess capital and the M&A environment. So Evan, you've given us some helpful indications of excess capital and wondering whether that \u2013 or how that takes into account past and potential future marks from rising interest rates.","And then, looking forward to the M&A environment, when you talk about P&C assets being pricey, how does that factor in the potential upside to acquisitions from rising interest rates?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","How does that \u2013 say that last part again?","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","How does the pricey-ness consider the upside to potential acquisitions from their own uptick in investment income if interest rates rise?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","No. We're \u2013 that's allowing the tip of the tail to wag the dog. I don't \u2013 they don't, really. Sure, we model it in, but that has a modest impact. That's an easy one for me. We're not going to over-intellectualize and try to rationalize to ourselves around here why it makes sense to pay for an acquisition that's overpriced. Just isn't going to happen.","And by the way, I do notice how the more recent have gone and people are talking like it's okay, prices to book that are above what ACE paid for Chubb. Wow, let's compare the quality of assets. Now, we're at that time in the cycle. We're happy at rest. I'm going to let Phil answer that other.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.","Meyer, when we think about undeployed capital, we don't consider unrealized gains or losses. If we have unrealized gains and losses, we assume we'll hold the assets and they'll amortize back to par at maturity. And if we have an unrealized gain, we don't count that as something we can spend because it would be requiring us to liquidate our portfolios around the world, and we just wouldn't do that.","So the calculation of undeployed capital that Evan mentioned takes about 70 basis points off of the ROE as calculated without unrealized gains and losses.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, fantastic. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. At risk of pushing my luck, I wanted to close the loop on the M&A discussion. And given Chubb's success in integrating and acquiring legacy Chubb, which is the largest deal in P&C, can you give us your perspective on whether Chubb is ready for another large acquisition? I mean, I know you mentioned pricing and things like \u2013 valuations and things like that. But operationally, is Chubb ready for another large deal?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Chubb is ready, but that hardly \u2013 A, it's ready, B, it's hardly my priority to distract the organization from doing what it's doing best, focused on executing and recognizing the potential that resides within all the parts and pieces that we have. And if this organization never does another acquisition, which is how we get up every morning to do business, that's how we imagine, the opportunity in front of our face is simply awesome, and it's just patience and time and execution, and that this organization is 100% focused on it, and that I can see and feel as I move around just the momentum building as people are just getting after it, it's energizing.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful. Separate question. It would be helpful to get your perspective on the Lloyds market, after that, that market had a pretty challenging year in 2017, including the major catastrophe events. What's your perspective on Lloyds and how is Chubb approaching that important marketplace?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. We've just through rational \u2013 because of rational underwriting and given our ability to trap the business locally and not have to wait for it to come to London, we've, over the last number of years, shrunk our presence in the London market. Can't earn an adequate return. To a large degree, a lot of the underwriters at London and in Lloyds, it's like a barroom with a bunch of drunks who want to reform and they just can't put that glass down and push away from the bar. And you hear all the talk and all the chatter, and it's in their hands to get out of their own way and do the most fundamental, underwrite the business to an adequate risk adjusted return and deploy the capital on that basis. And the notion that you have investors and that we can all opine about that will trade 3% money for a 6% return or thereabouts, that's a lousy risk-adjusted return, and ultimately is not a long-term investment thesis, period.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Crystal clear. Thanks, Evan.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. Two questions here. First, Evan, you talked a lot about professional liability. I'm wondering if we could chat a little about some of the other lines. Where are we right now with respect to rate adequacy, given your large commercial E&S, and maybe your standard commercial? So, pricing that you're getting right now versus the loss cost inflation trends?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. I would say, listen, in our middle market \u2013 in our businesses, fundamentally, most all of our businesses, we're achieving a rate adequacy. Some have better adequacy than others. We have \u2013 our businesses are earning an underwriting profit. Some in our judgment ought to be earning a bit better underwriting margin and profit, and we need rate to keep it from eroding. But, overall, look, you see the numbers we're putting up, not in bad shape and reserve adequacy is there.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","So what you're implying here is that your rate you're achieving is in line with trend at this point?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","It is in a lot of classes. It's not in all classes. There's certain classes of casualty, particularly in the larger risk business where rate is not keeping pace, but we've been taking a lot of portfolio and underwriting actions to have to mitigate. And that's where you see any penalties we might pay in growth.","By the way, when you look at an improvement in our loss ratio, keep in \u2013 that people note for the quarter. And by the way, it's just a quarter. There's some randomness by quarters. But keep in mind, the amount of business we shed in the last two years, it's like $1.5 billion. And when we constantly talk to you about portfolio management and shifting, and when John Keogh just told you about it about professional lines, its portfolio management and risk selection has so much to do with also helping to mitigate the impact of pressure on margin when rate is not adequate in some classes to maintain its level, given loss cost trends.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great, great. My second question, I want to focus a little bit on the small commercial business. You've built that a lot there. You've got the small commercial marketplace. Where are you with respect to expanding your distribution in that business, putting more agents on the platform? And is there a day in the future here where we could see Chubb basically competing with \u2013 on equal footing with some of the major small commercial carriers out there?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Well, I'm going to let Paul Krump talk about the distribution. I'm going to tell you, we can go toe-to-toe right now with the major players on an agent by agent basis in small commercial product offering, pricing, servicing and technology. In many cases, we're ahead on the technology front. It's just a matter of now building that portfolio, but we are toe-to-toe. Paul, you want to talk about distribution (00:55:21)?","Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, happily. So, thanks, Brian. Just to be very specific to you, right now, we've got 3,000 of our agents engaged on the platform. The platform is called Marketplace. So that's our small business platform where agent CSR can go right in there, write a BOP, work on the comp, the auto, and cross-sell against the financial lines, that kind of thing. So, we've got a couple thousand more agents that we're going to engage and activate.","What I'd tell you is very exciting for us right now is that 80% of the business that the CSRs are putting into the Marketplace platform is being handled automatically what's called on the Street on the glass. On the glass means they don't have to pick up the phone and talk to anybody, reach \u2013 can come out of the system, so it's very intuitive system. It's very fun for them to use. The agents really like it. And that's where I think we are really going toe-to-toe with people on the technology side. Comp has picked up very, very nicely as well.","So, we are looking at some areas where we think we're underrepresented when it comes to distribution and we're actively engaged in those conversations in those areas and we're open to talking to anybody that wants to bring us good profitable business.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Brian, it comes in very small bites. Again, it takes time. We're patient. We don't expect this business to cast a meaningful shadow on revenue for a period of time.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. I was just wondering about just the challenges in actually getting that distribution, that's always here in that business. You can have the product, but actually getting onto an agent platform is not always that easy.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Well, as you hear, we're making very substantial progress that way.","Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. Thank you.","Helen M. Wilson - Chubb Ltd.","And we have time for just one more person to ask question, please.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Ian Gutterman of Balyasny. Please go ahead.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Thank you. I'll cut to the chase, I guess. Evan, if I just follow-up on the reserve question from earlier, I think from Kai. Maybe if I ask it in a broader sense. I mean, I assume you guys look at what other people are doing and it seems like across the industry that people are putting up less IBNR. It seems like cases coming in faster across essentially most of the liability lines, whether it'd be GL, everything but comp basically, right? Do you agree with those observations? And if so, does that inform you of where we are in the underwriting cycle? That it seems like people are sort of being more aggressive and not willing to take their PICCs higher when they probably know they should and maybe that says something about why we're seeing a pickup in chasing rate.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Look, Ian, I can't speak to specific companies. We do observe and study. We're in the middle right now of looking at all the published numbers. So we haven't finished with our own internal views of some of it. What I will say is this, what's natural. Pricing was more robust a number of years ago in those accident years as they were reserved had greater margin of adequacy in them. As trend and rate roll forward, it's pretty simple. There's either \u2013 it'll vary by company. There's either less margin of adequacy or some move to inadequacy. It'll vary by company. And that seems to me to be obvious and we've all been talking about it for a period of time.","So, I love you dearly, but I'm a little puzzled by the question like in the sense like, wow, there's some surprise here, going on for a while.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Well, it feels like it got worse, I guess, in the last year or two.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Ian, it just feeds on itself.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Exactly.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","So, sure.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","It's more stressed at the end of 2017 than it was at the end of 2016, than it was at the end of 2015, period.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Right. I guess the reason I say is because if you look at most companies' results other than a few outliers, most companies in their calendar year GAAP results, you wouldn't really be able to tell that, I guess, is kind of the point I'm making.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Well, some that is that self-graded tests.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Right, exactly. Okay. Exactly.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah. I mean that's human nature and that's always been true in this business.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Fair enough. Then just one other -","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","By the lagging nature. And that's just the combination of optimism or ignorance or just plain old short-term cheating.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Exactly.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","So you can collect, check and move along.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","So one other quick one is and I'm sure you'll tell me I'm nitpicking and I probably am, but...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Well, it's your nature.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","... the small commercial growth of 2%. I assume you're hoping to do better than that. And I don't know if there is anything unusual in there, maybe underwriting actions or something else. Or is that sort of where you are today and (01:01:39) accelerate that?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","No, no, no. There was a quarterly anomaly in that for us.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay. I was just making sure.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","And we took some action. We have some professional lines business that go to that \u2013 that are in small commercial. And we had some legacy portfolios that have been moved in there and we took action on that. But if you look at the underlying BOP and comp and the P&C business, that actually grew like in a seriously robust way, like in the hundreds of percent growth.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay, that's what I was hoping to hear. Okay, just checking. Thank you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks a lot.","Helen M. Wilson - Chubb Ltd.","Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter.

This resulted in an annualized operating ROE of 10.9%. The combined ratio for the quarter was 93.8 compared to 94.9 last year. Excluding tax, the combined ratio for the second quarter was 86.3 in 2012 and 83.6 last year, with the difference attributable almost entirely to lower favorable development this quarter.","During the second quarter, we had net realized investment gains of $47 million before tax, or $0.11 per share after tax. This spread-out second quarter net income per share to $1.48 resulted in an annualized ROE of 10.4% for the quarter. GAAP book value per share at June 30, 2012 was $58.54. That's a 4% increase since year-end 2011, and an 8% increase since June 30 a year ago. Our capital position is excellent. We continue to make good progress on our share repurchase program.","Net written premiums for the second quarter were up 1%, driven by Chubb Personal and Chubb Commercial Insurance, which were up 4% and 3%, respectively. Growth at CPI and CCI was partially offset by a 6% decline in Chubb's Specialty premiums. Excluding the impact of currency translation, net written premiums at Chubb overall were up 2%.","Given our strong x cat results in the first half and our outlook for the second half of the year, we've increased our operating income per share guidance for the full year by $0.33 to midpoint, as Ricky will discuss in more detail later. But we'll start with Paul, who will discuss the performance of Chubb's Commercial and Specialty Insurance operations.","Paul J. Krump","Thanks, John. In Chubb Commercial Insurance, net written premiums for the second quarter were up 3% to $1.4 billion. The combined ratio was 97.5 versus 102.5 in the second quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's second quarter combined ratio was 89.3, compared to 87.3 in the second quarter of 2011. We are pleased that CCI's average U.S. renewal rate increased in the second quarter by 9%, continuing the positive rate momentum of the past 4 quarters. This 9% rate increase compares with the 8% we obtained in this year's first quarter, and 2% in the second quarter of 2011.","CCI secured U.S. renewal rate increases in each line of business in the second quarter of 2012. Once again, Monoline property rates increased the most with a mid-teen average, followed by general liability, workers compensation, package, excess umbrella, automobile, boiler and Marine. Further evidence of an improved rate environment can be found in the higher proportion of our accounts that renewed with rate increases. In the second quarter, about 90% of our U.S. accounts that renewed received a rate increase, compared to 80% in the first quarter of this year.","Turning to the CCI markets outside of the U.S., average renewal rates in Canada picked up nicely from the low single digits in the first quarter of the year to mid-single digits in the second quarter. In Europe, average renewal rates were up by low single digits in the second quarter, matching what occurred in the first quarter of the year. In addition, CCI continued to obtain rate increases in Australia, along with some of our smaller markets in Asia. Average renewal rates in Latin America were flat in the second quarter. CCI's second quarter U.S. renewal retention was 84%, up 1 point from the first quarter.","Along with strong renewal rate increases and solid retention, CCI's quarterly premium growth was aided by midterm endorsement activity and premium audits. With respect to new business, we continued to be vigilant in our risk assessment and pricing, which resulted in CCI's new-to-lost business ratio in the U.S. remaining at 0.9:1 in the second quarter, identical to the first quarter of the year.","Turning to Chubb's Specialty Insurance, net written premiums declined to 6% in the second quarter to $638 million, and the combined ratio was 91.4. For the professional liability portion of CSI, net written premiums were down 7% to $555 million and the combined ratio was 97.9 compared to 84.6 in the second quarter of 2011.","We are very encouraged that average renewal rates for professional liability in the U.S. increased to 7% in the second quarter, continuing the solid positive momentum that began in the fourth quarter of last year. The 7% increase in the second quarter was the strongest quarterly renewal rate increase since 2003, and compares to a 4% increase in the first quarter of this year, a negative 2% in the second quarter of 2011.","CSI obtained renewal rate increases in the United States in each of its professional liability lines of business in the second quarter of 2012. Rate increases were led by a private company and public company, D&O, both of which experienced average renewal rate increases in the low double digits. These were followed by EPL, crime, not-for-profit D&O, E&O and fiduciary. In markets outside of the U.S., average renewal rates for professional liability improved modestly in the second quarter, edging to positive depending upon the territory, whereas they were flat in major markets outside the U.S. in the first quarter of this year. Renewal premium retention for professional liability in the second quarter was 82% in the U.S., down 3 points from the first quarter. The new-to-lost business ratio for professional liability in the U.S. was 0.7:1, compared to 0.8:1 in the first quarter of the year. We'd like the professional liability business long-term, but current market conditions being what they are, this is not the time to be aggressively growing the book. We are willing to accept the decline in retention and new business as we reprofile the book for improved profitability.","In addition to driving renewal rates, we are increasing deductibles, shifting layers, refining our new business appetite and culling customer segments where we are unable to achieve rate adequacy. Regarding the surety portion of our CSI book, net written premiums in the second quarter were down 2% to $83 million, and the combined ratio was 42.8. While our surety operation was off to a slow start in the beginning of the year, activity improved for our customers in the second quarter as they were awarded more bondable projects.","And with that, I will turn it over to Dino, who will review our Personal lines results, as well as our corporate-wide claims.","Dino E. Robusto","Thanks, Paul. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 4% in the second quarter to $1.1 billion. CPI produced the combined ratio of 91.2 compared to 96.9 in the corresponding quarter last year. Impact of catastrophes on CPI's second quarter was 11.5 points in 2012, whereas last year, we had a second quarter catastrophe total of 14.5 points. On an x cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 79.7 in the second quarter, compared to 82.4 in the second quarter of 2011. This 2.7-point improvement is partially due to our having had fewer non-cat weather-related losses than we had in the second quarter a year ago.","The second quarter x cat combined ratio was the best quarter for CPI in 8 quarters, reflecting strong underwriting performance across all geographies and all product lines. Homeowners premiums grew 4% for the quarter, and the combined ratio was 90.3 compared to 97.7 in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 18 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 22.5 points in the second quarter of 2011. Excluding cat, the 2012 second quarter homeowners combined ratio was 72.3 compared to 75.2 in the same period a year ago.","Personal auto premiums increased 2% and the combined ratio was 93.2 compared to 92 in the second quarter of 2011. The growth of personal auto for the quarter was negatively impacted by a couple of points of currency translations.","In Other Personal, which includes our accident, EEOC and personal excess liability lines, premiums were up 8%, and the combined ratio was 92.6, compared to 98.6 in the second quarter a year ago. In the U.S., the second quarter of 2012 was the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in both premiums and in force policy count for homeowners and personal auto. In force count grew 1.5% for homeowners and 3% for personal auto. New business premium volume was up 7% overall in Personal lines. Policy retention was 91% for homeowners and 89% for auto. These retention rates were consistent with the first quarter of this year, and were up from the second quarter of last year by almost a 0.5 point in homeowners and a full point in personal auto. In short, we are very pleased with the performance and prospects of Personal lines.","Turning now to claims, corporate-wide. In the second quarter of 2012, the impact of catastrophe losses was $223 million before tax, accounting for 7.5 points of the combined ratio. The second quarter cat losses this year were almost evenly split between CPI and CCI. The $223 million reflects $249 million of losses before tax from 13 second quarter cat events in the U.S. and 1 event in Canada, partially offset by about $26 million in downward revision to our estimated losses from prior catastrophes, about 1\/2 of which was attributable to cat in the first quarter of 2012.","Nearly all the catastrophe losses in the second quarter of this year were attributable to winds and hailstorms, which affected highly localized areas within various regions of the United States. In particular, the Dallas and Oklahoma City hailstorms, as well as the intense windstorm which affected parts of the Midwest and Middle Island states, represented about 60% of our total catastrophe losses in the second quarter. Our losses from the Waldo Canyon wildfire in Colorado were not significant.","Although our catastrophe losses in the second quarter of this year were much higher than the first quarter of this year, they were far lower than the second quarter a year ago, when we had $329 million or 11.3 points of cat losses. For the first 6 months of 2012, catastrophe losses were $247 million before tax, accounting for 4.2 points of the combined ratio. This compares with $599 million or 10.4 points in the first half of 2011.","Now, I'll turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail.","Richard G. Spiro","Thanks, Dino. As usual, I will discuss our financial results for the quarter, and I will also review our updated earnings guidance.","We had solid underwriting income of $159 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 5% to $303 million, due primarily to lower reinvestment rates in both our domestic and international fixed maturity portfolios. Currency fluctuation also had a negative impact. Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $47 million or $0.11 per share after tax. For comparison, in the second quarter of 2011, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $69 million or $0.15 per share after tax. Amounts in both periods were driven largely by gains from our alternative investments.","As a reminder, we account for our alternative investments on a quarter lag because of the time required to receive updated valuations from the limited partnerships' investment managers. Accordingly, our alternative investment results for the second quarter reflect market performance in the first quarter, and our third quarter 2012 results will reflect market performance in the second quarter, which was less favorable. Unrealized appreciation before tax at June 30, 2012 was $2.9 billion compared to $2.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43.2 billion as of June 30. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.6 years, and the average credit rating is AA2.","We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At June 30, 2012, our holding company portfolio had $2.2 billion of investments, including approximately $740 million of short-term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at June 30, 2012, was $58.54 compared to $56.15 at year-end 2011 and $54.28 a year ago. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available for sale fixed maturities at amortized costs, was $52.34, compared to $50.37 at 2011 year end, and $50.39 a year ago.","As a reminder, during the first quarter of 2012, we adopted new guidance related to the accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. We elected retrospective application of the guidance, which reduced our shareholders equity as of June 30, 2011, and December 31, 2011 by $273 million or approximately $1 per share. These adjustments are reflected in the book value per share amounts that I just shared with you.","As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the second quarter of 2012 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CPI, we had about $30 million; CCI had about $85 million; CSI had about $40 million; and reinsurance assumed had about $10 million, bringing our total favorable development to about $165 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the second quarter combined ratio of about 5.5 points overall, including about 1\/2 a point of favorable development from prior year catastrophes. Please note that this favorable development from prior year catastrophes is already reflected in our catastrophe losses for the second quarter of 2012, and should not be double-counted when calculating x cat accident year ratios.","For comparison, in the second quarter of 2011, we had about $205 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $35 million in CPI, $80 million in CCI, $80 million in CSI and $10 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the second quarter of 2011 was about 7 points, including about 1\/2 a point of adverse development from prior year catastrophes.","For the second quarter of 2012, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 91.4, similar to the 91.1 in last year's second quarter. During the second quarter of 2012, our loss reserves increased by $155 million, including an increase of $177 million for the insurance business, and a decrease of $22 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The overall increase in reserves reflects an increase of about $105 million related to catastrophes, and the impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $70 million.","Turning to capital management. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares at an aggregate cost of $305 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $71.63 per share. At the end of the second quarter, we had $658 million available for share repurchases under our current authorization, and as we have said previously, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2013.","Before turning it back to John, let me provide you with some additional details on our revised guidance. We have increased our guidance for operating income per share for the full year to a range of $5.70 to $5.95, from the range of $5.30 to $5.70 that we had provided in January. As John mentioned, our increased guidance reflects our strong x cat operating performance in the first half of this year, as well as our outlook for the balance of the year.","Our increased guidance is based upon the following underlying assumptions: For our 2012 combined ratio, we expect a range of 93 to 94, compared to the January guidance assumption of 93 to 95. This improvement reflects our strong underlying performance in the first 6 months. We are assuming 4.5 points of catastrophe losses for the second half of 2012, based on the 4.2 points of actual cat losses we had in the first half. Our assumption for the full year calculates the 4.3 points or 8\/10 of a point higher than the 3.5 point cat assumption in our original guidance. The 0.8 point increase in our catastrophe assumption is more than offset by the expected improvement in our full year x cat combined ratio.","For those who would like to make a higher or lower cat assumption, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses for the full year on operating income per share is approximately $0.28. We expect net written premiums for the full year to increase 1% to 3%, including about a negative 1 point impact to foreign currency translation, based on exchange rates as of June 30, 2012. Our January 2012 guidance had assumed that net written premiums would be up 2% to 4%, and also included a negative 1% impact from currency. We expect property and casualty investment income after tax to be down 4% to 6%. Our January guidance assumed the decline of 3% to 5%. In both estimates, we assumed a negative 1 point impact of currency translations.","Finally, we assumed $271 million average diluted shares are outstanding for the full year, unchanged from our earlier guidance.","And now, I'll turn it back to John.","John D. Finnegan","Thanks, Ricky. Let me summarize a few of the key highlights of the second quarter. We had operating income per share of $1.37, despite the adverse impact from catastrophe losses of $0.56 -- $0.53 per share. Our annualized ROE was 10.4%, and then annualized operating ROE was 10.9%. We produced an x cat combined ratio of 86.3 and an x cat accident year combined ratio of 91.4, in line with the second quarter a year ago and much better than the second half of last year. We continued up with momentum of rate increases in all of our businesses.","Book value per share at June 30 was $58.54, up 8% from a year earlier, and up 4% from year-end 2011. We repurchased 305 million of common shares, and we paid 112 million in dividends. For the first 6 months of 2012, operating income totaled $843 million or $3.07 per share, a 17% increase compared to last year. Annualized operating ROE for the first half was 12.3% and annualized ROE for the first half was 11.8%. The combined ratio for first 6 months was 92 and the x cat combined ratio was 87.8.","Our strong performance in the first half of the year has enabled us to increase our 2012 operating income per share guidance to a range of $5.70 to $5.95. The midpoint of our revised guidance is $0.33 per share higher than the midpoint of our prior guidance, despite an increase in our catastrophe loss assumption for the full year from 3.5 points to 4.3 points. If you adjust for the $0.22 per share adverse impact of this higher annual catastrophe loss assumption, our outlook for 2012 operating income per share has improved by $0.55.","In summary, we have a very good second quarter on top of an excellent first quarter, and we continue to be encouraged by the rate increases we're achieving.","And with that, I'll open the line to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, so in CCI, it looks like you're moving with the market, taking rate increases. But in Specialty lines, it looks like you're moving against the grain, at least as reflected by the drop in retention. So would you agree with that statement? And can you provide color on the competitive dynamics between the measure of business lines?","John D. Finnegan","I think up to now -- over the last year, we started getting rate increases in Commercial a year ago. The Commercial market is the more receptive to rate increases. I think a couple of lines, especially property, of course, have -- with all those catastrophes we've had at workers comp. And with the higher loss experience in the industry has suffered, we fortunately have performed quite well in that area. So I think the Commercial market got -- we got there earlier. The market has moved with us, although, I think our rate increases are looking pretty good even compared to the average. And at this point, we feel good about it. Professional liability was a laggard. I mean, we didn't start increasing rates until the end of last year, the first quarter of this year. We've had a 3-point increase in each of the last 2 quarters. Are we going against the market? I don't know, I think that the market is moving certainly, but it's a tougher market at this point still. Our retention though, you can't read our retention as being necessarily indicative totally of the market. Our retention is down for 2 reasons: First, we're calling our book in some areas where we -- we start with 104 combined ratio, so we need rate and the fact that we got to get rid some of the accounts that are performing worse than 104. So we're calling the business -- that we don't see the market allowing us to take enough rate now in the near future, to make an adequate profit. So we're getting out of those businesses. In other cases, we're aggressively pursuing rate on least profitable lines of business, which has resulted in a significant decline in our retention on our poorest-performing accounts. We have a 5-star system and 1-star is our poorest-performing accounts, and retention on those over the last year has gone from mid-80s to mid-60s. We're still in the high 80s on our 4 and 5 accounts, which are best-performing accounts. So I think we're getting rid of accounts where we can't make money and taking the rates, I think, on the poor accounts. The ones we're taking, we got 35% of rate, 35% rate increases in this last quarter. We lost a lot of retention, but that's okay. At 104, you got to improve the profile of your book.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And do you feel like there's momentum in rates and property? Or have we kind of reached a level that, if this sticks for a little while, the industry and Chubb will be able to earn adequate returns?","John D. Finnegan","I don't know if there's momentum. You know we've -- not in third quarter, but the second quarter is better than the first quarter by a point. I guess just from a planning perspective, we're expecting continued significant rate increases in the U.S. but when accounting, I don't have any prediction on whether the rate increases will continue to accelerate. Professional liability again is a little different. It's been a laggard. It's been moving up a little bit faster. There\u2019s probably more reason now for rates to increase, but on the other hand, it's a tremendously competitive environment. So I'm not sure. Outside the U.S., which is 25% of our business, rate increases have been relatively de minimis. We saw some movement in Canada. Last quarter, our rates were up 5 points. It's not certain, but there's probably good reason to expect the overseas market to track the U.S. on a lagged basis, such that rate increases will pick up over the next few quarters.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And lastly, I was hoping you could shed some light on your Latin American and Asian A&H business. Would you be able to say how big that business is, and does it opt for similar return characteristics in the U.S. A&H business?","Paul J. Krump","This is Paul, Mike. I'm not going to give you a premium breakout by continent. But we -- I can tell you this, it's the inverse of our typical book of business and say, Personal lines or Commercial or Specialty, in that 75% of the premium for A&H is outside of the United States, about 25% is within the United States. The business outside of the United States is actually more profitable than the business in the United States and we're working hard on improving that business in the U.S.","John D. Finnegan","It provides probably greater growth protection.","Paul J. Krump","Oh, absolutely.","Operator","And next we will go to Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","My first question relates to pricing, and these are obviously, phenomenal rate increases compared to some of your competitors. I'm curious if you could sort of extend on new business pricing as it relates to CCI?","Paul J. Krump","Sure, I can take it. Again, this is Paul. First off, the spread between rates on renewals and new customer businesses is very -- now very small. But again, that's reflecting a very selective underwriting approach to new business on our part. In turn, that underwriting discipline has resulted in lower levels of new business over the last year. The general matter though, agents are putting more renewals into the market today because nearly all cost to carriers are seeking some level of rate increases. We are very pleased to see these new opportunities, but most of these business deals are coming in the market, need at least a level of rate increases that the incumbent carrier is seeking. As a result of that, we're just being very selective in our underwriting and pricing of new business. And that's the reason why new business is only making up 12% of our overall commercial book, both for standard and Specialty in the second quarter. Just for some perspective, that's near a historic low for both groups. Back in the very hard market of 2004, CCI was enjoying new business growth of 21% and professional liability was at 19%. So -- anyway, the bottom line is that we realized that new business rarely performs as well as our season renewals. Accordingly, we're just carefully scrutinizing this business and expect rates in the business to try to be as good as they are in the renewals, and that just means we're being very diligent in how we're going about it.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's actually very helpful. The only other question I had was on capital management. If I look back, typically, buybacks will slow down in third quarter and then pick up later. Just based on your strong capital position, I'm wondering, would anything change in Q3 this time, or should we anticipate the usual slowdown and then pick up at end of the year?","Richard G. Spiro","It's Ricky. I'm not going to predict how many shares we're going to buy back in the third quarter. I'll just stick to what I said during my prepared remarks. Our intention is to complete the program that's remaining on it by the end of January 2013. And that's the only thing I can say about our future buyback plan.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So a big question for you on public D&O. Did I hear you correctly when you said that you're getting low double-digit rate increases? I'm very impressed with that, and I'd love to get a sense of what's going on in that market because if that's right, that would seem to be a huge swing from where we've been not very far long ago, and if we're wondering, can I get a sense of what's driving that among the incumbents there?","Paul J. Krump","Yes, you heard it correctly. And the honest answer is, we're pushing it very, very hard. And as John said, our professional liability will go up at 104 combined. So we're very cognizant of the need to push rate, and we're spending an awful lot of time working on the book of business. At Chubb, it's always about improving the profit, and so we keep trying to improve the overall rate on the renewals. We try to make certain that the new business is coming in, equally as good, at least the quality of the business is equally as good as the renewal business. But yes, the primary segment is actually doing better on the public and we're also seeing improvement in Side A and excess, where a good portion of our book of business is.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's great. As you guys are calling your book, I'd be curious to get some color around some of the changes you're making. Has the industry picked up bad underwriting habits over the years? Or is this \u2013 or are there specific classes where there's just more loss to merchants than expected to securities, a different gain or creative litigation or something? Or is this just generally -- there's been rate need in the industry, and now you\u2019re going to get a chance to address it?","John D. Finnegan","I think to some degree, culling the cards all at the time, I think there's been a little more enhanced culling in some areas in recent periods. For example, with the recent cat models and the level of catastrophe activity. We've seen some culling in some of our property lines in geographic areas where we have bigger cat exposures. But on Commercial overall, standard Commercial, other than that is for more of an ongoing sort of culling. And professional liability, you have to do more. I mean, when we're running 90, you didn't need to cull as much. And running at 104, well, how did we get there? I think we had about 6 years of rate declines in professional liability. But it was obfuscated to some degree by very benign loss trends in the second half of last year. Loss costs escalated, and we talk about that on the third quarter, fourth quarter calls. It caused us to increase our combined ratio of professional liability at the end of last year, and increased our projections for the current calendar year. Now the rate of escalation has not continued, but at 104, you -- therefore by definition, if that's the average, you have some stuff running on 115, you got to get out of it or get rate. And -- so I'd say, it's certainly, an enhanced culling that's occurred in professional liability.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's great. Just one final numbers question. Workers comp seems to have increased a lot, relative to your other lines, some of which are shrinking. Is that the audit adjustments you guys are talking about? Or should we actually see you guys as taking share in workers comp?","Paul J. Krump","It's a combination of several things. Yes, there's audit premium coming in. We had a tremendous amount of rate. The retention has held up quite well there. The actual in force count is respects -- workers compensation is growing nowhere near the amount of what was it -- 13 points for the second quarter? In fact, that number has actually slowed down in the second quarter than what we were seeing sequentially in, I think, the first and the fourth.","John D. Finnegan","Workers comp growth is down quarter-to-quarter sequentially, right?","Paul J. Krump","Yes.","Operator","And next from Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Michael Nannizzi.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just trying to understand a little bit, so in the underlying combined ratios, if I look at CCI and CSI, deteriorated a bit versus 1Q and also versus 2Q last year. Trying to reconcile that to the rate that you've gotten over the last 3 quarters, is it that loss cost trends are the missing piece, or what am I missing in thinking that the underlying should start to improve?","John D. Finnegan","You're talking about x cat combined ratio?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","X cat and x prior year development, yes.","John D. Finnegan","Yes. Well, CCI was marginal, right? I mean, not much difference. CSI has its own issues as we've talked about. In CCI, we have had -- well, again, you -- look, you have to compare the premium growth and the loss trends. And loss trends do fluctuate for individual periods obviously, but just on a longer-term basis, let's call it 4% loss trend. Now, you take our 9% rate in premiums, and you got added earned impact premiums -- earned impact of a rate at 6%, that's U.S. Worldwide was slower. So you're probably between 4.5% and 5%. You parsing it pretty closely, between that and a 4% underlying cost trend, which can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. For example, we had one major boiler loss this quarter. Not worth mentioning, except that you're talking about the difference between 4.5% and 4%. So not a big issue. In CSI, we really haven't had the earned premium impact of CSI as minuscule so far. I mean, we had 7% in the U.S., less overseas in written premium, but it's come up quickly. We're probably at 1 point in the second quarter of earned premium impact. So it's not having the big effect. What happened, though, is that the loss trends over the last year have gone up more than the -- most of the long-term trend because of the big increases in the third and fourth quarter. Move to a more plateaued level now, but you're still up a little bit more. So -- you really can't look at margin expansion there. You haven't gotten enough earned premium to even have an impact yet.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess the rates wouldn't be so -- if these rate levels continue, how long will it take to get -- especially, in CSI and CCI, to get to underwriting profitability that is -- given where investment income is, that is acceptable to you, internally, without the benefit of favorable development?","John D. Finnegan","Well, let me say this. Let's talk about what the impact of rate increase is. What we'd see is on a Commercial book, we're well on our way. We're probably going to have a net effect on earned premium. Earned premium, the rate impact will be about 5% for the year, 7% in the fourth quarter. That will be positive. Mild impact overall on the calendar year, positive probably. But 2013, if we continue at this level, it should have a significant improvement in margin expansion. Professional liability is going to take time to catch up, in terms of rate. And we might be getting there by the fourth quarter, and we might be rolling the rates depending on what happens at lease levels of cost escalation going next year. But the important -- the -- really big driving factor in professional liability and financial results in any individual quarter, the more function of the presence or absence for systematic events and longer-term loss trends. So combined -- well, actually combined ratio is tough to project. And CPI, I think by the end of this year, we're in good shape, and next year should be a year of margin expansion. Just basically, on the rate versus loss cost escalation analysis, now of course, you just assume it's historical loss cost trends in all these businesses. In actuality, the losses in any given quarter or even year tend to be lumpy, falling above or below the trend line. So they're not predictive, but theoretically, in all of our businesses, we're improving our margin position. Commercial's -- it's probably first to the party. Personal, right behind. Specialty take a little longer, but Specialty results will be much more effective by the type of underwriting initiatives and actions we're taking, than the pricing in the immediate future.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And I mean, are you seeing -- last one, are you seeing any increased competition, anyone, kind of spoiling the party on the rate side in either CCI or CSI?","Paul J. Krump","No, we don't see any one person doing there, or anyone carrier doing that, and if we did, we won't identify them here.","Operator","And we'll go next to Vinay Misquith of Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is on CPI. The margins of x cat's prior accident basis were really strong this quarter versus the year ago and the last quarter, could you help us understand what's happening there, please?","Paul J. Krump","Yes, on a x cat basis, the improvement, to a large extent, is due to a light quarter this quarter from non-cat weather compared to the second quarter last year, where we had a much higher impact on non-cat weather losses.","John D. Finnegan","The weather was better over there.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","All right. How about the first quarter of this year, because I'm looking at an accident year, combined ratio x cats of around 82 7 this quarter versus about 87 3 last quarter. Was is just pure non-cat weather?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes, a large component of it was principally non-cat weather. When you compare it, the second quarter of 2011, you had a little bit of improvement in the expense ratio, about 3\/10 of a point, and we had also a little bit of improvement in our accident results.","John D. Finnegan","For the first quarter, you generally have a little bit more non-cat weather than you have in the second quarter. But both quarters this year weren't too bad, in terms of non-cat weather, given the weather.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And you mentioned margin expansion next year, or maybe later on this year within CPI. Can you help us understand sort of what the pricing and loss cost trends are on the land, please?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes, so if you look at our U.S. homeowner rate and exposure increases, we produced a written premium impact of about 5% in the first half of 2012, and that's going to probably generate, by year end, a little bit more than 5% for the full year. That's the written premium impact. That's going to translate into an earned premium impact for the year of about 4%, which is in line with our loss cost trends that are about 4% in Personal lines. We expect to enjoy an additional increase in earned premiums of about 6% in 2013. So there, all else being equal, you're going to see some meaningful margin expansion, and if you look at our rate filings that are taking effect in the third and the fourth quarter of this year that are targeted to take effect -- and I say targeted because some are subject to regulatory approval -- we're filing rates in the high single-digit and sort of lower mid-teens in a bunch of states. So it's looking good.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And could I just have one more follow-up on this? I believe you mentioned that the pitfalls up by maybe about 1.5% in homeowners, and 3% in auto. If you could help us understand what's driving that, I mean, are competitors taking rates up in homeowners much more than you are? Or is it just your initiative to spread out across the country more?","John D. Finnegan","Yes, you would typically think when you're filing for these kinds of rate increases that you'd see a little bit of a hit on retention, and the reality is our retentions remained flat over the past 2 quarters in homeowners, and then it's at a historically high level. So really, what we think is the widespread rate-taking that's going on in the general market, is really leveling the playing field in mitigating that dynamic.","Operator","And now we'll go to Jay Gelb of Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I had 2 questions. The first is on the LIBOR issue. I know it's early days, but I think there's some concern out there that directors' and officers' liability for financial institutions could end up being exposed to some of the civil litigation involving LIBORs. I'm interested in getting your thoughts on that first.","Paul J. Krump","Sure, Jay. This is Paul. First off, I agree with you. I think it's very important to remember that this is really early days, and what actually happened to peers could still be unfolding. So the full facts are not yet known. It's really too early to speculate how the situation will play out, what the full extent of the allegations may be, and against whom. In addition, as you know, Jay, we will not, obviously, comment on whether or not a specific organization or person is a customer in a given situation. What I can say, as respect to Chubb's professional liability business, is the following. First, we have very little E&O exposure to large global or money center banks. Second, for Chubb, only 3% of our worldwide professional liability book is comprised of public D&O covers for financial institutions. We have a very diverse book, which just doesn't include large banks. It has other bank -- other institutions in there as well. Third, as respects any potential D&O exposure for larger banks, the vast majority would be Side A covers or high excess layers for traditional Side A and B covers. These are the key points when thinking about Chubb because Side A only covers claims brought against a director or officer, if the Corporation is unable or not allowed to indemnify them. High excess participation is important to consider because if and -- it's still a big if. If D&O coverage ever was brought into play after an institution's self-insured retention and these type of banks take very large SIRs. The primary layers will typically absorb much of the defense cost. Another data point for perspective is our average attachment point on our excess, FI, D&O book at Chubb, is in excess of $80 million. And turning a little bit to the factual information surrounding the LIBOR issue as we understand it at this point in time, it appears there would be some serious D&O coverage issues as well. Just to name a few, regulatory fines and penalties are typically excluded, company investigate costs are typically not covered, intentional acts and\/or criminal acts exclusions may be triggered, and while a shareholder derivative claim could be covered under certain situations, absent insolvency, which doesn't seem to be likely in this situation, the settle amounts -- settlement amounts are typically fairly modest. And lastly, traditional securities class actions could potentially develop if the implicated banks or bank experience a stock drop directly attributable to LIBOR issues. But as far as we know, and as of today, that has been the case for only one of the banks that has been mentioned in the news. So that's kind of where it stands, as respects LIBOR for us at Chubb at this point in time.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I think I know which bank that is. Switching gears, John, can you give us an update on succession planning?","John D. Finnegan","No, it's still early. They're not kicking me out yet, so we got to...","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I don't expect them to, but it's a mandatory 65 retirement age, is that right?","John D. Finnegan","As it would be applied, it would be the end of 2014.","Operator","And moving on to Matthew Heimermann of JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One numbers question, if I could, for Dino. The $26 million of favorable prior cat development, could you break that out between CPI and CSI for us?","Dino E. Robusto","Yes, so in Personal lines, it included a slight upward revision of about $1 million from prior events. And on Commercial lines, the catastrophe losses in the quarter were inclusive of about $27 million of downward revision.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then just on professional liability probably, you did a great job of kind of highlighting kind of what rate was doing across the different businesses that make up that segment, as well as some of the changes you're making. I just be curious, within \u2013 is it, I'm just, well, let me -- what's the best way to ask this? With respect to some of the individual products, I mean, are you seeing higher or lower retentions kind of, in some of those individual products or kind of the low retention and the need to get account improvement, is that consistent across kind of the product base? And I'd also be curious whether or not the shift from primary to excessive loss is specific to any individual coverages, or kind of generalization as well?","Paul J. Krump","Okay, Matthew, I'll give it a go here. In a nutshell, yes, the overall rate range, if you are thinking about that way in professional liability, did differ from the overall 7% rate change that we averaged in professional liability in the second quarter that I quoted. It went from a low single-digits for one product on average to mid- to very high teens on a few other products. And it's obviously buried then within those as well by subsegments and obviously, when you start looking at individual accounts, it can be a very, very large range. The important thing, I think, to think about here, though, is that we're really working to reprofile the book of business. So when John talked about the star rankings, if you will, from 1 to 5, within our book, we look at the stars' rankings though, of a 5-star account and what's happening to the rate there, and what's happening to the retention versus the 1-stars and the 2-stars, et cetera. And I can tell you that in general, those patterns look very encouraging to us.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, maybe -- I guess, maybe one of the things I was hoping to get out of it, and this is poorly asked questions, so this is my fault. Just when we think about retention or maybe even percentage of accounts that are 4- or 5-star, is that in any way inversely related to the amount of rate you're getting in those individual product lines right now?","Paul J. Krump","Yes, that exactly what I was saying, Matt. Or maybe I wasn't being very...","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, I wasn't asking it well, or hearing it well then.","John D. Finnegan","It's this number ideas before. It was that we were getting 35% rate increases in the worst category. We're getting low single-digit rate increases in the best category. Retention in the worst has gotten from 85% to 65%.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, I just didn't know if for example, D&O, public D&O and private D&O, where you're getting the biggest rate increases, if that had the highest percentage of low-star accounts.","Paul J. Krump","I really don't want to reveal it here, but it's -- there's a different bell-shaped curve, Matthew, to each product line.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Then, I guess one follow-up I had was just when we think about the rate you're getting on the public D&O. Is part of the reason you're getting such a big increase is a function of maybe having a little bit more primary layer exposure, especially given that some of the issues in loss trend side have seemed to view litigation, we go coverage?","Paul J. Krump","Maybe I could just step back a little bit because I know that there's been some thoughts around excess versus primary. I can tell you that, yes, primary took higher rate increases than excess. But we've got years of experiences doing D&O and lots of data, and when we think about pricing, what we first do is individually price the account ourselves in primary and then we think about what is an adequate price for each layer of the tower, and then we decide where is the best place to play. And -- well, our book may have shifted a little bit to excess over the last couple of years. It's because we found, in our individual pricing, that there was better margin opportunity in some of these excess plays. But it boils down to individual account, 1 over and 1 account underwriting.","Operator","And going to Meyer Shields of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions, if I can. One, could the audit premiums have a material impact in the workers compensation combined ratio change year-over-year?","John D. Finnegan","Combined ratio or growth? The growth?","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The combined ratio. I understand the growth part.","Paul J. Krump","Well, when we pick up an AP, and additional premium from an audit, it goes right to the bottom line. It's fully earned. So they always help the combined ratio.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, is there anyway of ballparking that?","John D. Finnegan","I don't think we've ever done it, so I don't...","Paul J. Krump","I don't have it off the top of my head.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Second question, and it's going to sound a little nitpicky, but John, when you talk about that 104% combined ratio in the professional liability, was that assuming that the loss cost escalation that you saw last year continued?","John D. Finnegan","Well, it's one of those actuarial questions. It definitely comprehends the fact we had an increase in loss cost in the second half of last year. I think our loss cost trends for this year are probably in longer-term basis that picks up somewhat in escalation, but certainly doesn't extrapolate all of it from the first half of last year to the second half of last year. It picks up anticipated rate increases. It picks up anticipate -- it picks up initiatives we have under way. And it's a projection, which is -- it's always uncertain. It's a long tail line. We don't get a lot of loss experience to test it against for a few years. But it has higher losses, obviously, expected than we had in the initial loss picks a year ago.","Operator","And next, we will go to Adam Klauber of William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Your earnings guidance is higher than it was before, but it suggests that earnings for the second of the year will be below what they are in the first half of this year. Why is that?","John D. Finnegan","I think 2 things. One, if you could tell from the guidance, our investment income is down in the second half of the year versus the first half. And second, we have a little bit, couple of point higher, x cat combined ratio assumed in the second half of the year. This is, I would say, a couple of reasons. They're qualitative, I mean, first is that, Asia in the past 2 years, we have seen a deterioration in combined ratio in the second half versus the first half last year, with 3 or 4 points. And secondly, it might be difficult to replicate the unusually lower x cat combined ratio that's running in the first half of the year, to some of our business, such as homeowners, which had an unusually low level of non-cat-related weather and had terrific numbers. Now going against that, as we make in a little pickup from increased rate, although you have to compare that to loss trend -- loss escalation. So those are the 2 factors.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And one quick follow-up, your commercial casualty, it looks like paid losses are pretty good, actually down from the first half of last year but looks like the loss ratio was up. Why the disparity?","John D. Finnegan","Prior period development, I think, was significantly different.","Paul J. Krump","And the other thing, that you're comparing it against last -- the first and second quarters of 2011, they were just remarkably good in the casualty line at 83 and 84, and I think we told you then that there was -- probably not sustainable. It was -- they were just unbelievably good.","Operator","And we'll go to Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions, just the first one, kind of a picky one, but the $26 million of prior period development in the cat line, was that all prior year? Or were some of that in the first quarter?","Dino E. Robusto","Yes, it was split between the first quarter and prior year, about $15 million in 2011, and the rest in 2012.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And the bulk of that, obviously, in the Commercial side, where the development was. Question for Ricky. Ricky, can you talk about the new money yields available in the market that would mimic your portfolio, how they compare to your book yield? And then in addition, if you could talk about the level of assets that you see maturing in 2013?","Richard G. Spiro","Sure. Well, I'll take the second question first. In our 10-K, we have a breakdown of our maturities over the next number of years. I think it's on Page 67 of the 10-K. The number for 2013 is about $5 billion that mature. I hope that answers the second part. As far as the first part, obviously, rates continue to move down, I'd say today, we are reinvesting on the tax exempt side at roughly, call it 125 to 150 basis points lower than the maturing book yields. On the domestic taxable side, it's probably 250 basis points, and it's also about 250 basis points lower on the -- outside the U.S. fixed income investments.","Operator","And we have one more fellow in the queue. We'll go to Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","I have 2 clarifications as well. One on the guidance, Ricky, I was doing some quick math so I may be dangerous here, but in the original guidance, the midpoint was a 94 combined. Now we're at a 93.5 midpoint. So half a point is $0.14 and when I look at every other assumption, it was either static to worse, right? The shares were the same. The premium was down, and NAI is down, so if we only had $0.14 of better combined ratio, everything else is a tad worse, how do we get $0.25 to $0.40 increase in the guidance? What's the other piece I'm missing?","Richard G. Spiro","Sure, well, it's hard for you to see but it has to do with rounding. We were on a number of alternative scenarios related to business unit contribution, current and prior accident year results, when we're coming up with our guidance, and we can reach our guidance levels in a number of different ways. The reality is when we put together the ranges for a combined ratio and everything else, we end up rounding, so that the actual midpoint of the numbers that we come up with to our scenario analysis may not be 94, in the case of the January guidance. It could be a few 1\/10 higher or lower in either direction. And the same thing now. So when we looked -- the way it worked down -- and the reason we were able to raise it by $0.33, is even though we raised our cat assumption by about, now we call it, 8\/10 of a point, that was more than offset, because when you look at the way the x cat combined ratio has moved, putting aside the rounding per second, in our mind, those were up about 2 points or improved by 2 points. So we ended up with more than 1 point improvement in the combined ratio. It's just hard to see when you're just looking at the midpoints.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","And then on professional lines, I guess it's a 2-parter. One, is just -- it's now the third quarter in a row that we're at 104 accident year. I guess, I'm trying to figure out what got so bad. I mean, Chubb doesn't normally write annualized, but especially professionalize it in underwriting loss. It's back to loss off mark. So sort of, A, how we've gotten here that were still sticking at this 104, that we're not seeing any improvement, and then, B, do you think you're writing new business to underwriting profit? And is it just a matter of waiting for that to get earned out? Or is there something more to it?","John D. Finnegan","No, I think they're all good questions. I think the answer is, we got there unfortunately, and then it came about because for many years -- and actually before we have rate the contract, we had 10 to 12 points of Q level rate decline over a 5- or 6-year period, and -- but we're still looking like we're writing stuff pretty well, at pretty good rates. The -- look, charts are benign. Then they picked up. We've talked about them in the second half of 2012. We started in sort of economic-related areas. They weren't credit crisis as such, but they were crime, fidelity. We saw a pickup in those, and we saw a pickup in D&O and merger objection suits, and there was a -- and then finally, a big one was the increase in employment practices liability, which for reasons you could figure out. So \u2013 what did we run the first quarter, 2 quarters, last year? Accident year -- and we've traditionally, high 990s, so I mean, don't mistake reported with accident year. We reported for about 7 years that we had an average report of about 87. We had great years. But our initial accident year for many years, I mean, the credit crisis, for example, was very high. We had over 100 that year, and that's an initial accident year. So it's a little bit higher than we traditionally run without an x -- so it's a rate decline and because of the increase in losses. Now I don't think it's your bookkeeping by quarter because much of this line is projections on long-tail classes. So we projected it's going to run 104 this year. In a lot of these classes, we won't see losses -- experience it more than 10% of the projection for every year. So we wouldn't have any loss experience to really assess it against to any great degree, except for a few of the shorter tail line. But that\u2019s a small portion of the book. So I would expect the 104 -- hey, if things stayed the way they were on loss ratio, we might move down a little, because the expense ratio will decline over the course of the year. We had a little bit of increase on loss activity in the short tails in the second quarter. That could go away. But you're looking at 100, 105, probably, for the rest of the year. Nothing big is going to happen until we get more loss experience, in our long-tail lines, and\/or until we see significant rate increases that we can embody in the projection. Now, Ian, your point is right. We're certainly running at unattractive returns. At 104 though, it's still profitable business. It's not profitable enough. I mean, it's probably mid-single-digits, is where we're at, and that ain't going to get it done. But it's not unprofitable business. And listen, we're pretty good at this business and I don't, those loss increases that came about in employment practices liability, merger objection suits, crime and fidelity, they didn't affect us alone. A lot of companies don't break out this stuff. They're not running 95 here. I mean, there's no way that they're running significantly better than us. And given our track record, and given the fact that the gas was usually in the opposite way, it's hard to believe they're not running higher than us.","Operator","At this time we have no further questions.","John D. Finnegan","Thank you very much for joining us tonight. Have a good evening.","Operator","And once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference.

Today's call is being recorded.","Before we begin, Chubb has asked me to make the following statements. In order to help you understand Chubb, its industry and its results, members of Chubb's management team will include in today's presentation forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is possible that actual results might differ from estimates and forecasts that Chubb's management team makes today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such differences appears in Chubb's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In the prepared remarks and responses to questions during today's presentation, Chubb's management may refer to financial measures that are not derived from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in the press release and the financial supplement for the first quarter 2014, which are available on the Investors section of Chubb's website at www.chubb.com.","Please also note that no portion of this conference call may be reproduced or re-broadcasted in any form without Chubb's prior written consent. Replays of this webcast will be available through May 23, 2014. Those listening after April 24, 2014, should please note that the information and forecast provided in this recording will not necessarily be updated and it is possible that information will no longer be current.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Finnegan.","John Finnegan","Thank you for joining us. As we said in the press release today, Chubb produced solid results in the quarter, which was adversely impacted by several factors, including cat and non-cat weather losses due to the harsh winter weather in the United States, and then usually high level homeowners' fire losses. We are very pleased with the continued positive rate movement in all three of our businesses along with continued strong retention.","Our commercial businesses have particularly strong quarters. In professional liability, our combined ratio of 84.6 was as good at quarter as we've had in five years. It represented a whapping 7.8 point improvement from our first quarter of last year.","In CCI, our x cat combined ratio of 82.4 was our third best quarterly performance in six years. The performance of both of these businesses benefited from the rate actions and underwriting initiatives that we have undertaken over the past few years.","Operating income per share was $1.50 compared to $2.14 in last year's first quarter. Annualized operating ROE was 10.1% for the first quarter of this quarter. The combined ratio for the first quarter was 93.2 this year compared to 84.6 last year. Excluding the impact of cats to combined ratio for the first quarter was 86.6 in 2014 versus 84 a year ago. This deterioration is more than fully accounted for by the higher x cat weather-related losses and homeowner fire losses in this year's first quarter.","During the first quarter, we had net realized investments gains of 160 million before tax or $0.30 per share after-tax. This brought up first quarter net income per share to $1.80 resulted in an annualized ROE of 11.1%. GAAP book value per share at March 31, 2014 was $66.36, that's 2% increase in sheer end 2013 and a 7% increase at March 31 a year ago.","Our capital position is excellent and we continue to actively repurchase our shares as Ricky will discuss later. In addition, during the first quarter we increased our common stock dividend by 13.6% to $2 per share on an annualized basis. It was Chubb's 32nd consecutive annual dividend increase.","Now, for more details on our operating performance, we will start with Dino, who will discuss Chubb's commercial and specialty insurance operations.","Dino Robusto","Thanks, John. Chubb commercial insurance and Chubb's specialty insurance, both had strong performance in the first quarter, starting with CCI, the first quarter combined ratio was 88.5 in 2014 compared to 81.9 in 2013. The impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 6.1 point of the combined ratio compared to minus 1.7 point in the year ago first quarter. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's first quarter combined ratio improved from 83.6 in 2013 to 82.4 in 2014. The 82.4 is within (indiscernible) points of CCI's, the best x cat combined ratio in the last six years.","CCI's first quarter net written premiums were down 1% to $1.4 billion with flat growth in the U.S. and down 4% outside the U.S. which in general continues to be a more competitive environment. Although overall growth was down, we continue to retain our best accounts and write new business in the segments where we are the most rate adequate. While at the same time, maintaining discipline of culling accounts where we can't secure appropriate terms and condition. A balance among these actions will vary from quarter-to-quarter based on our mix of business, which in the first quarter resulted in a small decline in overall premium.","This slow start in the beginning of the year actually improved in March. In April, it's coming in even stronger than March. So we are optimistic about stronger growth in the second quarter than the first quarter based on the quality and quantity of opportunities we are seeing in our target markets.","CCI's average U.S. renewal rate increase in the first quarter of 2014 was 5%, which is above our long run loss cost trend. Given the 6% to 7% increases we experienced in the U.S. in the prior three quarters, the year end impact in the first quarter was 6%. Outside the United States, CCI's average renewal rate increases were in the low single-digit.","CCI achieved average U.S. renewal rate increases in every line of business. And as we discussed on our prior earnings call, after three years of rate increases much of our book is no longer in need of large rate increases. So, on a number of segments we are pushing for greater retention and more moderate rate increases and we are writing the majority of new business and segments, but we are the most rate adequate. And the first quarter in the large part reflects this strategy.","CCI's first quarter renewal retention in the U.S. increased to 85% from 83% in the fourth quarter of 2013. CCI's new to loss business ratio in the U.S. was 0.9 to 1 compared to 0.7 to 1 in the fourth quarter of 2013, and 0.8 to 1 in the same period last year.","It's important to remember we have never relied solely on rate to achieve our historically excellent results. As more and more of our book approaches rate adequacy and rate increase is moderate, we will continue to target growing our profit by remaining vigilant in our underwriting and management of our mix of business across our board set of products in customer segment. It is this legacy of underwriting expertise that allowed us to build an enviable book of business, which we expect will enable us to maintain strong performance relative to the industry in any market.","Moving to Chubb's specialty insurance, net written premiums were down 1% in the first quarter to $624 million. CSI's first quarter combined ratio was 88.9 in 2014 versus 87.4 in 2013. For the professional liability portion of CSI, which represents the lion share of the portfolio, net written premiums were up 1% to $552 million. Similar to CCI, the marketplace outside the U.S. continues to be more competitive than in the U.S. with premiums down 2% outside the U.S., but up 2% in the U.S.","The combined ratio for professional liability improved almost eight points to 84.6 from 92.4 in the year ago quarter. That 84.6 is the best combined ratio that professional liability has produced in the last ten quarters.","We are very pleased with the 7% average renewal rate increase we achieved for professional lines in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2014 as we continue to drive greater profitability. The first quarter of 2014 was the 10th consecutive quarter of professional liability renewal rate increases in the U.S. and the 7th consecutive quarter that professional liability rate increases ranged from 7% to 9%.","Each of our professional liability lines of business in the United States achieved renewal rate increases in the first quarter. As in CCI, we continue to differentiate our rate and retention action based on the performance of each line of business and each policy.","In markets outside the U.S. average renewal rate increases for professional liability in the first quarter were consistent with the fourth quarter 2013 rising by low single-digit. Renewal retention for professional liability in the U.S. in the first quarter was 85% up one point from the fourth quarter 2013 and up four points from the first quarter of 2013.","Retention was the highest for our best performing segments and lowest for our worst performing, again improving the overall quality of our book of business. The new to loss business ratio for professional liability in the first quarter was 0.9 to 1, up from 0.8 to 1 in the fourth quarter of 2013, which continues the flow of steady improvement in that metric since the first quarter of 2013 as more of the new business we target is meeting our demanding underwriting standards.","Turning to the surety portion of our CSI book, net written premiums in the first quarter were down 13% to $72 million, also impacted by the competitive marketplace outside the U.S. The combined ratio for surety was 122.9%. The unusually high combined ratio was driven by one large loss in the current accident year from an insured outside the United States that was primarily engaged in mining construction services, whose business failed due to several problem contacts they inherited as a result of an acquisition.","As we've stated in previous earnings calls, results can e lumpy in the surety business as the presence or absence of a large loss can have a significant impact especially on one quarter's results. The last time surety had an unprofitable quarter was back in 2008. Our aggregate loss ratio since 2005 is under 15%. So clearly our surety business has been very profitable and remains attractive to us.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul, who will review our personal lines and corporate-wide claim results.","Paul Krump","Thanks, Dino. Chubb's personal insurance net written premiums increased 3% to $1 billion, and CPI produced a combined ratio of 101.8 compared to 87 in the corresponding quarter last year. CPI's profitability was adversely affected by the severe winter weather resulting in both increased cat and non-cat losses as well as several large fire losses.","The impact of catastrophes on CPI's first quarter combined ratio was 11.2 point in 2014 compared to 3.9 points in the first quarter a year ago. On an x cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 90.6 in the first quarter compared to 83.1 in the first quarter of 2013.","Homeowners' premiums grew 4% in the first quarter. The combined ratio was 104.9 compared to 82.5 in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 17.9 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the first quarter of 2014 compared to 6.1 point in the first quarter of 2013.","Due to the unprecedented cold snap, some of the homes of our targeted high net worth customers experienced costly interior damage especially from burst pipes and ice damages. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the 2014 first quarter homeowners combined ratio was 87 compared to 76.4 in the same period a year ago. This 10.6 point difference is more than accounted for by the first quarter's unusual non-cat weather-related losses and an increase in the impact of large fire losses.","As I mentioned, the severe winter resulted in an elevated level of non-cat weather-related losses compared to last year's mild winter. Non-cat weather-related losses accounted for about 14 points of our homeowners combined ratio in the first quarter of this year, which is nine points higher than in the first quarter of 2013.","In addition, we experienced an uptake in home fires or a perspective on how the first quarter 2014 fire loss impact stacks up. It was 4.5 points higher than in the first quarter of 2013.","To summarize, when one compares the homeowners x cat loss ratios of the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2013, this year's elevated non-cat weather-related losses added nine points. And the impact of fire losses added about 4.5 points. Together, these 13.5 additional points of losses in the first quarter of 2014 more than account for the 10 points fixed point of year-over-year deterioration in the homeowners' x cat loss ratio.","During the first quarter of 2014, we achieved an average homeowner's renewal rate and exposure increase of 7% in the United States. The same is in the first quarter of 2013. Our pricing momentum remained strong, and this is our fourth year of homeowners renewal rate and exposure increase.","Personal auto premiums declined 2%, and the combined ratio was 101.4 compared to 94 in the first quarter of 2013. Worldwide auto growth was down in the quarter as we experienced a negative impact from foreign currency translation, as well as, slower growth in our Brazilian operation due to targeted rate action. Auto growth in the U.S. remains strong at 5% driven by renewal rate and exposure increases. U.S. in force comp was up slightly as well versus the first quarter of 2013.","The auto combined ratio in the quarter was adversely affected by challenging winter driving conditions in many parts of the United States including flooding in an affluent section of Palm Beach County, Florida in mid January. All told, the unusual winter weather resulted in about three points of auto losses in the quarter.","Policy retention in the U.S. in the first quarter was 90% for homeowners and 89% for auto, both of which are essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2013.","In other personal, which includes our accident, personal excess liability and yacht volume, premiums were up 3%, and the combined ratio improved to 92.4 from 94 in the first quarter a year ago.","Turning now to claims corporate-wide; in the first quarter of 2014 we had cat losses of $199 million before tax or 6.6 points on the combined ratio. This reflected about $206 million of losses from seven cat events in the United States and one event outside of the United States, partially offset by about $7 million decrease in our estimated losses from catastrophes which occurred in prior years.","The U.S. events included two catastrophes that occurred in early January of this year for which we provided a preliminary loss estimate at the time of our last earnings conference call. Our current estimate for those events remains in line with our earlier estimate, and they accounted for the bulk of the overall catastrophe impact in the quarter. Of the total first quarter catastrophe losses, 60% were attributable to CPI and 40% to CCI.","Now, I'll turn it over to Ricky who will review our financial results in more detail.","Richard Spiro","Thanks, Paul. As usual I will discuss our financial results for the quarter and I will also provide an update on the April 1st renewal of our major property reinsurance program, looking first at our operating results underwriting income with $208 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after-tax was down 4% to $277 million due once again to lower reinvestment rate in both our domestic and international fixed maturity portfolio.","Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $116 million or $0.30 per share after-tax. For comparison, in the first quarter of 2013 we had net realized investment gains before tax of $138 million or $0.34 per share after tax. In both quarters, $0.14 per share of the net realized investment gain came from alternative investments.","As a reminder, unlike some of our competitors, we do not include our share of the change in the net equity of our alternative investments in property and casualty investment income. We included a net realized investment gains and losses. Unrealized depreciation before tax at March 31 was $2.2 billion compared to 1.9 billion at year end 2013.","The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $42.9 billion as of March 31, 2014. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.9 years and the average credit rating is AA3.","We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At March 31st, our holding company portfolio had $2 billion of investment including approximately $830 million of short-term investment. Book value per share under GAAP at March 31 was $66.36 compared to $64.83 at year end 2013.","Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available for sale fixed maturities at amortized cost was $62.39 compared to $61.86 at 2013 year end. As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the first quarter of 2014 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows. In CPI, we had approximately 5 million, CCI had 90 million, CSI at 65 million and reinsurance assumed had zero bringing our total favorable development to approximately $160 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the first quarter combined ratio of almost 5.5 points overall.","For comparison, in the first quarter of 2013 we had about 119 million of favorable development for the company overall including 5 million in CPI, 125 million in CCI, 55 million in CSI and 5 million in reinsurance assumed.","The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2013 was about six points. For the first quarter of 2014, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 91.7 compared to 90.2 in last year's first quarter.","During the first quarter of 2014 our loss reserves increased by $26 million, including an increase of 40 million for the insurance business and a decrease of 14 million for the reinsurance assumed business which is in runoff.","The overall increase in reserves reflects an increase of $57 million related to catastrophes and the impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $25 million.","Turning to capital management, we repurchased 4.7 million shares at an aggregate cost of $409 million during the quarter. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $86.73 per share. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1.2 billion available for share repurchases under our current authorization. And as we said on our last earnings call, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2015.","In February, as John mentioned, our board raise the quarterly common stock dividend by 14% to $0.50 per share or $2 on an annual basis. This is our 32nd consecutive annual dividend increase, a continued indication of our consistent performance and financial strength.","I'd now like to say a few words about our reinsurance program. On April 1st, we renewed our major property treaties including our North American Cat Treaty, our Non-U.S. Cat Treaty and our commercial property for risk treaty. We renewed these programs with a similar limit structure to what we had in 2013, but with expanded coverage and improved terms and condition.","The reinsurance market was orderly and there was plenty of capacity to meet our needs in each treaty as you might expect we are an attractive [cedent] (ph). We achieved double-digit price decreases on all three property treaties that we renewed and the aggregate cost of these three treaties will be meaningfully lower than last year.","In addition in March, we successfully completed our sixth catastrophe bond offering East Lane VI to replace the maturing cat bond. The transaction was very well received by the market, and this enabled us to increase the existing limit from 225 million to 270 million and expand the perils covered relative to the expiring arrangement at attractive pricing.","Under this new arrangement, we purchased fully collateralized multiyear coverage to supplement our reinsurance program for the perils of main storm including hurricane and tropical storm, earthquake, winter storm and severe thunderstorm in the northeast U.S. running from Virginia to Maine.","In terms of pricing, we attained the lowest pricing ever achieved on a cat bond with U.S. hurricane risk. Similar to our previous cat bonds we have indemnity-based trigger, which means that our right to collect is based on our actual incurred losses as opposed to industry or index-based losses. We like the diversification that these cat bond arrangements bring to our overall reinsurance program, especially in our peak zone.","Importantly, they provide us with the cost effective fully collateralized alternative to traditional reinsurance with pricing locked in for several year.","And now I'll turn it back to John.","John Finnegan","As you can see, first quarter results were a mixed bag. A strong underlying performance was offset to a large degree the by the impact of higher cat, non-cat weather-related losses and unusually high homeowner fire losses. The adverse effect of these factors is reflected in our operating income per share for the first quarter of $1.50, which was $0.60 per share less than the $2.14 per share we earned in the first quarter of 2013.","This $0.64 per share differential, $0.45 per share was attributable to higher cat in this year's first quarter. Remaining $0.19 per share difference was more than accounted for by the $0.23 per share aggregate negative impact of higher non-cat weather-related losses $0.15, and homeowner fire losses $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2014. Bear in mind that we also had this surety loss which accounted for approximately $0.10 per share this quarter.","Cat\/non-cat weather-related losses and homeowners' fire losses had the most pronounced adverse effect on the profitability of personal lines in the first quarter of this year. The deterioration in the personal lines combined ratio versus the first quarter of last year was more than totally attributable to these factors, which can swing significantly from quarter-to-quarter.","As we have said before we have enjoyed benign loss experience with respect to non-cat weather and large homeowner fires for a number of years. And as indicated in our January call, our guidance for this year contemplates some reversion to the mean in 2014, and we certainly got it in the first quarter. Well, nothing is for sure, we think it is reasonable to expect lower level of non-cat related weather and fire losses during the balance of this year.","Turning to our commercial businesses, we feel good about a number of positive developments in the first quarter. Professional liability first quarter combined ratio improved almost eight points from the first quarter of last year. It was the eighth consecutive quarter in which our combined ratio and professional liability improved. All of our accident year loss ratio was about 66, 4 points better than last year's first quarter.","Our x cat CCI combined ratio of 82.4 was 1.2 points better than the first quarter of last year, two points better than last year's full-year combined ratio and better than any full-year combined ratio in the recent memory.","There is also place in all three of our business units we continue to obtain mid single-digit renewal rate increases in the U.S. in the first quarter of this year. Commercial, we now enjoy mid to high single-digit renewal rate increase for 10 consecutive quarters. Also in professional liability we have now enjoyed eight quarters of mid to high single-digit renewal increase.","In personal lines, the homeowners' line of businesses enjoyed nine quarters of mid to high single-digit renewal increases. Meanwhile we continue to enjoy strong renewal retention in all of our business units. Finally with respect to capital management, we returned $533 million to our shareholders in the first quarter, $409 million of share repurchases and $124 million in cash dividends.","With that, I'll open the line to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Amit Kumar from Macquarie.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Thanks, and good afternoon. Two quick questions; first of all, just going back to the discussion on the fire losses. Can you sort of expand on the nature of these fire losses and was there some sort of a geographic concentration to these fire losses?","John Finnegan","I think the quick and dirty answer is no geographic concentration, and most of fire losses from quarter-to-quarter are a matter of good fortune or bad fortune. No pattern really.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, got it. That was just more of an aberration than anything else.","John Finnegan","Well, we were aberrational on the low side for a few quarters, and this was a little bit on the high side. So we've been talking about a little reversion to the mean. Yeah, hopefully it will revert back down a little bit. But yeah, we've had a good run, though.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Got it. I got the point. The second question I have is -- and this relates to CCI. I think the comment was made that you have gotten good rate increases for some time, and hence based on the book of business that level of rate increases diminishes sort of going forward. If you were to fast-forward, let's say to the end of 2014, how do you foresee the rate versus loss cost equation to shape up?","Dino Robusto","What I could say is we look at April. Pricing in April appears to be in line with what we saw in the first quarter, but I can't predict what the rest of the year is going to bring. What I can tell you is that we continue to differentiate our rate increases by account based on the underwriting merits and the performance of each of the accounts. There is a meaningful difference in the average rate changes we get. And so, we're going to continue to execute that strategy.","One thing on loss cost trends, to keep in mind, obviously you got this sort of benefits of the like earned impact of the prior quarter's higher rate increases and those all play forward for a couple of quarters, but I can't really predict what's going to happen to rate by the end of the year.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, so all is somewhat of a steady state right now.","Dino Robusto","Yeah, what we saw essentially in April.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Got it. Okay, that's all I have. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Dino Robusto","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And let's now go to Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the call. So, I appreciate all the commentary on pricing and it sounds like you guys think your bad adequate, and obviously record earnings, so it is a probably a good confirmation of that. The question is if you think about the industry structurally, you guys have visibility to sort of the way people actually act, we are just trying to respond to earnings calls and things. What do you think happens when the rest of the industry isn't inadequate? Are we going to maintain sort of pricing stability more or less like around the rate of inflation, kind of like theoretically the new rationality should leave people to do, or when you talk about things like double-digit declines in reinsurance pricing, do you think we'll sort of see like a real softening cycle, if you look at six months or a year and you are sort of doing your planning and you are thinking about the people you are actually competing with?","John Finnegan","So, I think for one thing the industry is a good deal from price adequate. I mean I think in some lines we are getting the price adequate. I have seen professional liability for example, we have made great strives and we are probably running a steady face '95. If you look at normalized expense ratio, and that's still not really price adequate over a longer term in current interest rate.","I would guess the industry on a current accident year basis fully loaded for caps to current investment rates, the industry itself is probably running high single-digit. There are some of our competitors that are running like us, running low double-digits, but that's still not quite where people want to be. So I think there is a way to go.","There is lot of people who can speculate on how the market will react as we go down the road. I really don't have any great insight. I think we're all taking a wait-and-see. Reinsurance is interesting, but for now the benefit to us whether it will be a detriment down the road, it's just hard to say.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","That's fair. If I can ask another question, so I am surprised as you guys are shrinking internationally this quarter. I realize I didn't know that much honestly about your national businesses, and I am wondering it's better to refer to your book, and we don't talk that much about it. I am wondering if you can give us just some color on sort of what's going on, and big picture, the growth opportunities internationally, and how you guys are sort of able to leverage Chubb as a global brand? Thank you.","John Finnegan","Paul, you can answer. I'll start off and say it's more like a quarter of our business, not a third.","Paul Krump","Yeah, I would say, Josh, it's about 25%, it depends on the line of business, and the personal lines base. It's right around 25%. We have some very good opportunities for growth. What you saw -- and we saw mostly in our auto, because Brazil is a very large automobile market for us. We took some rate action. I think Dino has mentioned that on previous calls. So we have been surgically improving the book of business there. So we had about flat policy in-force count in Brazil, but when it translated it into U.S. dollars, it came back down about 10%.","If I go over to the accident help business and other areas, that is more disproportionately outside the United States and almost the inverse about 70% outside the United States, 30% inside the United States. We've been enjoying some very nice growth there. We have been writing both employer groups and some affinity groups. So things like travel accidents for credit cardholders outside the United States.","Dino Robusto","And on commercial, as we've been indicating over some of the prior calls and we said it today too, we got a lot less rate historically overseas is just a much more competitive marketplace in particular places know Europe and clearly we are not going to chase any unprofitable business and maintain a disciplined approach. And so, we are seeing a little bit less growth recently.","Over time though we still see good potential and we expect that the underpricing will eventually catch up in the marketplace, and we will continue to be a player outside the United States.","Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. And next we will go to Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Good evening, thank you for taking my call. First question on the 150 basis point deterioration in turn by your underlying combined ratio year-over-year, how much of that is attributable to this non-cat weather and the large fire losses, and also the surety loss?","John Finnegan","Well, I would say about 200 basis points are attributable to non-GAAP weather and fire losses, so it's more than accounts for the deteriorations. And the surety loss will be another point.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Another point, okay.","Dino Robusto","And then the fire losses were probably another point as well.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Okay. So as we -- sort of the rate of increase is actually slowing down, and if inflation keeps the same that it's right now, and at what point we would no longer see the underlying margin expansion?","John Finnegan","As you know, I think the part of the thing is that it's a little bit complicated like most say. Margin expansion is a long-term projection that doesn't take into account quarter-to-quarter variation. We saw significant variation in this quarter. But just looking at it, I mean you can do the mathematics and say it's 4.5 or two points now and we still haven't earned premium as we move forward in terms of margin expansion. But also remember as rates come down, our book has improved.","So whether you call that a lower loss cost trend line or more immediate impact to loss cost right now, there is a benefit. You need 10 points if you have -- maybe you have nothing but a lousy book and when you prune that book, you don't need 10 points any more, you need less points. I don't know that you can just as easily just look at -- given where the book is let's compare it to full points and say the point is too higher. It's got this pretty close. I think right now we get margin expansion, but again, we have a better book. So we would expect a little bit less rate as we move forward.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you. Lastly on the sort of reinsurance cost, you mentioned that meaningful lower sort of like reinsurance costs, would that flow directly into the bottom line, or are you going to tap some of it on to consumers?","Richard Spiro","Well, again, I think as John said, we are now -- we are going to benefit from those lower costs whether or not we incorporated that into pricing as we go forward, time will tell.","John Finnegan","You are thinking -- in the order of magnitude you are thinking $30 million, $40 million, $50 million on a $4 billion book. It's not a major driver of the pricing decision.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Next we will go to Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Hi, good evening. For the higher fire losses in the non-cat whether that's about three points year-over-year change, just curious how much of it was higher was on a normalized basis for this quarter, because last year I believe it -- you had a below average number?","Richard Spiro","Yeah. Give us one sec. So if you look over a five year average for first quarter for non-cat weather-related losses, this is excluding the current first quarter, so that five years prior, we had about seven points on average of non-cat weather relate losses in our first quarter. The same comparable number if you look at fire losses would have been about eight points. I am sorry, yeah, eight points. And again, those numbers are on homeowners' loss ratio, not on the overall company.","John Finnegan","And remember you would expect that the first quarter of a year would have a little bit higher non-cat related weather than most of the other quarters, right? Fire will be different, but non-cat related-weather is almost -- first quarter was about 14.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Sure. So for the non-cat weather that was seven points in average versus I think this quarter was 14 points you said?","John Finnegan","Yes.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Right. And on the fire, do you normalize this eight versus towards the nine for this quarter?","John Finnegan","Yeah.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Okay, that's helpful. Secondly on the auto combined ratio, that also seems to be high. I believe you mentioned three points or something. If you could just help me understand that, it will be helpful. Thanks.","John Finnegan","Sure. You are talking about the personal auto?","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Yes, correct.","John Finnegan","Okay. What you have in the personal auto was the three points of the adverse weather that was hitting it. I mentioned as well we had experienced some profitability issues in Brazil. We have been taking action there. We feel like we are addressing that very adequately through our surgical underwriting action and specific rate taking by tier. I just -- of course you would remember that we have a very small auto book in our portfolio. So it doesn't take much to move the overall combined ratio. We have enjoyed good rate and exposure increases of five points in that book of business. And our U.S. book is growing at 5%. That's really the story behind auto and the personal lines front.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Fair enough. And just one last follow up. So looking at the reduction in the pace of rate increases and the increase in per retention and the new to loss business, it seems that there is a modest improvement, but curious from your perspective as to what -- so how you will you look at the risk reward period being taking less rate versus sort of growing the book, because the book doesn't seem to be growing right now.","Dino Robusto","Yeah. As I indicated a little bit earlier, after multiple years of rate on rate increases plus given the fact that we have been calling the lowest performing parts of our book in managing our mix of business. Increasingly, we are focused on retaining our best accounts, and also those kinds of rate increases that have impacted some of the new business opportunities. So we are looking at increasing the retention and going after a little bit more new business which we saw. It didn't really manifest itself in the total. In the aggregate as I indicated outside U.S. was still a little bit more competitive, so our growth was down there, and there was a couple of additional factors affecting some of the growth on the U.S. side. Our exposure decrease was actually two points and that was function of the fact that we were reducing our participation on certain accounts to manage our aggregation.","So that had a dampening effect on what you are seeing in term of the higher retention and a little bit more new business, but directionally clearly we are interested in retaining more of our accounts and we see some good opportunities going forward. And so, as I indicated earlier, a little bit more optimistic that the growth will look a little better in the second quarter.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Hi, thanks. So I guess one question I had was obviously reinsurance is very inexpensive for the market for you in particular, why not -- but the homeowners' book shrank obviously, there are some issues on homeowners' book that were specific to the quarter, but why not grow that book of business if you are able to get very good rate, you are comfortable with the risk profile and you can buy an expensive protection?","Paul Krump","First of all, Mike, this is Paul, and homeowners grew at 4% in the quarter. So we felt pretty good about that. I would tell you that we do look at reinsurance, occasionally we look at it opportunistically in the homeowners' front. It depends on the geography. It depends on the customer, but when we most often step into the [fact] (ph) market is where we are looking at the ultra high net worth that kind of a family office type exposures where they have properties all over the globe often times in places like Florida. And that's where we use reinsurance the most often on a facultative basis in the homeowners' world. Dino, I don't know if you want to add anything.","Dino Robusto","I mean you don't have any new overall strategy to increase the reinsurance prices, but clearly as thoughtful underwriters, we are always looking to maximize our risk-return tradeoff. And lower reinsurance pricing could potentially offer us that on certain accounts, and we will clearly look at that.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And then maybe if I could, Paul, on the comp book, can you comment just a bit on where that is right now on an underlying loss or combined ratio basis, and whether or not you are continuing to get rate there at the same level as previously or where that's factoring relative to loss trend? Thanks.","Paul Krump","Yeah. So the workers' comp, it continues to be very profitable for us. The rate increases for comps have declined from the higher levels that we saw on 2011 and 2012, and -- but we continue to see some really good performance in it. Our growth was down a little bit this quarter, but in general we are very optimistic about our comp portfolio. It's been historically very profitable, and we continue to see it as an opportunity going forward.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","So where are you writing that business now? Can you tell us?","Paul Krump","Yeah, so the combined ratio in the quarter for our commercial workers' comp was 84.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","On an underlying basis?","Paul Krump","No, no, no, calendar year.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","Okay. So I guess my question is whether it's comp or other business, I mean, obviously you have your levels of profitability that you are willing to write business and we can't see it at the segment level because we just don't have this disclosure, but is there -- are you seeing the market competitors that are looking to get -- to frankly start to get more competitive and pick up your business if your threshold for profitability is higher than their's? I mean because you are running in 84 comps, you are probably writing it as 74 on an underlying basis -- it's clearly profitable. Are other people willing to write that business at less profitable levels because they can clip the coupon on the investing side and maybe give you more competition whether it's there or whether it's in other books?","Dino Robusto","Well, just in terms of the competitive side of it, as we've always indicated we write our workers' comp in our work comp portfolio in parallel with other coverages, in our target niches and its attractive business. It's been historically profitable, but our retentions has stayed historically very high, and clearly based on our value proposition we can keep the business that we want on comp based on all the other lines that we are writing. And your question about where we are writing it, we are writing it across the U.S. in line with our target market strategy.","Paul Krump","Mike, I would just add that as underwriters we put our business into -- we tier it all the time. It's where that we lose a customer just on a couple of points of price. We know which ones are performing exceedingly well and which ones are not performing so well. So we put them into different cohorts, and our underwriters are trained to know when to back away and when to let an account go and when to hang on one. I think at 84, it was a very good quarter for workers' comp.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs","We all know. Of course, absolutely. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we will go to Jay Cohen with Bank of America.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America","Yeah, thank you, a couple of questions. You had mentioned in the property reinsurance treaties getting better terms and conditions, I'm wondering if you could give us a bit more detail on that?","And then, second question I'll ask is, in CCI did you have a similar experience with non-cat weather as you did in personal lines or was that -- would you consider that to be fairly normal?","Dino Robusto","You want to answer?","Richard Spiro","Yeah. Jay, it's Ricky; I will start with the first question on reinsurance and then Dino will take the non-cat weather. So I'll give you one example, the biggest change that we were able to achieve was with the definition of a single occurrence for key perils. So as you probably know within cat treaties, a single occurrence or specific perils is based on the number of hours from the beginning of an occurrence to the ending of occurrence. And the losses that fall within the hours caused for a given peril are covered in the single loss occurrence. Generally speaking, one hour causes are better for the ceding company, so you have more time in which to cover losses that occur as part of an event.","So with that as background, I'll give you one specific example. In our North American cat treaty for the peril of hurricane and tropical storm, our expiring hours caused with 96 hours or four days, and our new hours cause is a 168 hours or seven days, so a meaningful increase in the length of time that we can put losses for a specific event. And that sort of thing happen for almost all the perils in each our major treaties, so a very positive development for us.","Dino Robusto","Then on the non-cat weather, it's clearly much more of a personal lines issue for us. In most cases, weather event that could trigger large commercial losses is probably going to be designated a catastrophe, and in fact, in the first quarter of 2014 we did not have any large non-cat weather-related property losses.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America","Got it. If I could squeeze one more; it's a yes or no question. You talked about having some favorable development in the cat line, was that also -- did that also show up in a favorable development that you talked about overall?","Richard Spiro","Yes, it did. It was about 0.2 points of development related to that. So you don't double count. If you're trying to get to say, our accident year, x cat combined ratio, you got to deduct about 0.2 points from the overall favorable development number.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America","That's helpful. Thanks, Ricky.","Operator","Next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Thanks, good evening. Just with regard to the weather, does that have any favorable impact on workers' compensation, because there is less activity going on outside, is that all relevant?","John Finnegan","Good question. I guess we've never thought of it that way. I don't think we have an answer to that. I think (multiple speakers) claim data points they give you.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Okay. I'm not trying to take anything away from the 84.","John Finnegan","I think, A) It's a good question, B) It has stumped us, and C) I can assure you it wouldn't be material to the 84, I'm sure. Yeah.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Okay. That's the part that matters. Second, with regard to the culling, I'm not sure how to quantify this question, but can you compare how much of your book now is in the underperforming tiers compared to what a reasonable long-term target is?","Dino Robusto","I can't really quantify it exactly for you. What I can clearly tell you is that a lot more of our accounts in our book is rate adequate, and which is why you saw a little bit of the slight moderation in the rate. We are still getting, though, some strong differentiation. One thing maybe as the data point that I can give you, if you look at sort of distribution of the increases in the U.S. about 20% of our CCI book got greater than 10% rate increases, whereas our professional liability was roughly a quarter of the book that got over 10 in terms of price reductions. Less than 10% of our book got rate decreases from both our commercial lines and professional liability lines, but clearly over time, we have less and less of the need for the larger rate increases.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Okay. That's very helpful. And is there any difference in terms of loss cost trends outside of U.S. and inside?","Richard Spiro","The lines of business are roughly the same. I would say it's roughly the same.","Paul Krump","Yeah, I would agree.","Meyer Shields - KBW","Okay, fantastic. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we will take the next question from Ian Gutterman with BAM Investments.","Ian Gutterman - BAM Investments","Hi, I just had a couple of questions on reserves. The first one, in CPI the 5 million releases, I know that's the same as last year, but most quarters that's 20, 30, 40 favorable, was there anything that was less unusual in CPI?","Richard Spiro","No, really it's hard to say the correct definition. Most of it came from personal other, and then there was a small piece that came from homeowners due to what we were talking about earlier, the favorable prior year cats, and personal auto was a little bit adverse.","Ian Gutterman - BAM Investments","Okay. So there is less releases from home than usual, that's what it sounds like.","Richard Spiro","Yes.","Ian Gutterman - BAM Investments","Okay. And then the other one, this is a little bit more tactical, but on D&O reserves, going through your Schedule P, the other liability claims made, my analysis, I think several of the analysts on the sell-side published more analyses that seem to show that they, say, starting in 2010 through 2013, those accident years don't look to be reserved as well as the older years.","At the same time, obviously you guys have discussed for the past couple of years running hot in the lines that are more frequency-type lines that arguably would cause pays to happen sooner than if we looked at the historical pay pattern. So I was wondering if you had any insights into why we are seeing that pattern where it seems like reserves aren't as strong as what (indiscernible) professional lines?","Richard Spiro","Sure. Well, obviously as you are pointing at it, if you aggregate what's shown in part two of Schedule P for our individual writing companies, the average development in the other liability claims made for two of the accident years, that being '11 and '12, were slightly adverse; about $4 million adverse in '12 and about $ 9 million adverse in '11. So when you say that there they're developing adversely, there is really hardly any change at all.","The other thing I would say is that there are naturally many moving parts within an aggregated line of business like this. So parsing movement this small, it's contributing elements is inherently problematic, but as you point out, we have talked on prior earnings calls about, for example, some of the issues we've had with the employment practice liability line. And so, part of the adverse development you are seeing is related to that.","Going forward, I'd say these accident years are still green and we will see how it develop over time, but we said our year end reserves we believe are at appropriate levels and you guys can draw your own conclusions.","Ian Gutterman - BAM Investments","If I can just clarify a little bit, I'm not so much aware that they developed adverse initially. It was more looking at -- I am not so much worried that they developed adverse initially, it was more looking at sort of the initial page relative to incurred in the early years versus older early years and the initial IBNR versus other year's IBNRs, would that be -- it seems like there is maybe a tale that's changing. And it's obviously hard for us outside given some of the points you raised to disembowel that I guess. Is there any suggestions you can give us on what appropriate adjustments might be that might give us a better answer?","Richard Spiro","Yeah. Again, it's hard to point anything specific. There have been some mixed changes that may have some impact there, but nothing on a philosophical basis that I would point out.","Ian Gutterman - BAM Investments","Okay, great. That's all I have for tonight. Thanks.","Richard Spiro","Thank you.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Finnegan, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","John Finnegan","Thank you very much for joining us. Have a good evening.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference, and thank you for your participation."],"5104":["Chubb Ltd (NYSE:CB) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Helen Wilson - SVP, IR","Evan Greenberg - Chairman & CEO","Philip Bancroft - CFO & EVP","Analysts","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley","Elyse Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank","Ian Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management","Meyer Shields - KBW","Jay Gelb - Barclays PLC","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG","Operator","Good day, and welcome to the Chubb Limited Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Helen Wilson","Thank you, and welcome to our September 30, 2017, third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, economic and market conditions and integration of our Chubb Corporation acquisition and potential synergies and expense savings. These are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. See our most recent SEC filings and earnings press release and financial supplements, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.","We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement, at investors.chubb.com. In particular, references to 2016 underwriting results will be on an as-if basis, which includes the Chubb Corporation's results for fiscal 2016 and excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments relating to the merger.","Now I'd like to today's our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.","And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.","Evan Greenberg","Good morning. It was a difficult quarter for the insurance industry and Chubb, a quarter dominated by catastrophe losses. But frankly, it's a part of the business we're in. The headlines were obviously the series of large natural cats, specifically Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as the Mexican earthquakes while no one has certainty at the moment, the third quarter events will likely cost industry in the range of $80 billion to $100 billion-plus anyway. ","For Chubb, our after tax net cat losses estimated $1.5 billion cost us about 1 quarter of earnings or about 3.5% of our September 30 tangible capital. In the aggregate, this was within our risk tolerance, and the amount of loss we would expect from these types of events. We view the loss for these events as between a 1 in 5 and 1 in 10-year industry and Chubb event on a worldwide aggregate basis. This gives you sense of how we think about risks, including basis risks in the models and significant amount of non-modeled loss that is included primarily from Harvey and likely, Maria and Irma. By the way, '17 is on track to join '05 and '11 as the third $100 billion-plus year for insured cat losses in the last 12.","The events of the third quarter for Chubb were first and foremost about service and responding to our customers in their time of need. Let's remember, that's what insurance is all about, and that's why we exist. Our claims organization is large, experienced and so capable, and with a mindset to serve. They've performed admirably and at times, heroically, often sacrificing their own personal well-being in the impacted areas of Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico to come to the aid of our customers and distribution partners and solo employees. In a spate of about 6 weeks, they responded to nearly 17,000 claims in 5 different major events. Service levels remained consistently high with over 95% of the 52,000 customer calls in North America answered in less than 5 seconds, and by a human being from our company, not a machine or third-party. As of today, over 90% of Harvey and Irma claims have been physically inspected.","I should add, our loss prevention and claims organization continue to perform at the highest levels, and distinguish our company as they respond to both our Personal Lines and commercial lines customers impacted by the California wildfires, which as you know, remain an active cat. ","On the prevention side, our special wildfire defense services teams have so far visited over 250 homeowners and taken active measures to protect more than half of them. By the way, when it comes to wildfire prevention services, the high net worth customers, there are a few pretenders doubting capability but with little exception. No one holds a candle to our vast network of capability.","Looking beyond this quarter's catastrophe losses in the shadow it cast, it's an important story to tell about our company. Our underlying health is excellent. Excluding the cats, operating income was about $1.5 billion or $3.12 per share. Our published combined ratio was 111% because of the cats. Excluding them was 847. The current year accident basis excluding cats, the combined ratio was 88.5 compared to 88.9 last year, with the loss ratio of up over 1 point, and the expense ratio down 1.7%. Of the expense ratio last year included an adverse impact of about 0.5 percentage point from purchase accounting, the 1.25-point improvement illustrates our merger-related efficiency efforts. ","Net investment income for the quarter was a record $893 million, up nearly 8% over prior year and a very strong results, which included a one-time item Phil will speak more about.","In the quarter, per-share book value grew 0.5% while per-share tangible is essentially flat. Book intangible are up nearly 7.5% -- 5% and 7.5%, respectively so far for the year. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, the cats and prior period development.","Given the inadequacy of pricing and terms in our number of important classes around the globe and the consequent anemic industry results, along with the magnitude of year-to-date cat losses, we should be at the beginning of a firming market, and I believe we are. How extensive and broad the firming remains to be seen, and the timing will vary by geography and type of business, but pricing should and will move. While conditions vary depending on territory, line of business and size of risk, pricing overall today is to cheap and we should strive for price adequacy. Chubb is a leader, and we recognize our responsibility to insist on receiving an adequate rates for the coverage we provide. This includes educating our customers and distribution partners about the reason and need to move pricing to adequacy where it is not, so that we earn a reasonable risk-adjusted return and avoid more volatile price moves in the future if prices continue to stagnate over the road.","Following years of rate decreases, properties need rate to return to adequacy. Property rates have 2 components, the catastrophe and attritional loss elements. Property cat risks should be priced to model, and today it is priced at its substantial discount to model in many instances. The attritional loss component of property is also, in many cases, inadequately priced and should return to adequacy. And by the way, even though it is inadequately priced, property cat premiums have been used by many to subsidize inadequate pricing and other classes during the recent years of lighter cat losses, a pretty dumb strategy.","As I have said in the past, many classes of D&O and employment practices liability are not adequately priced. Loss frequency and severity are increasing, combined ratios have reached a point in certain classes that are simply unacceptable. ","Many primary and excess casualty-related losses, including U.S. commercial auto need rate. Loss cost trend while more benign in recent years has nonetheless continued while rates have moved down. Chubb's risk appetite has not changed. We have an exceptionally strong balance sheet and we're willing to deploy it where we can achieve an adequate underwriting margin.","Before the third quarter's cat events and during the third quarter, like the second, we were beginning to see signs of a bit more stable pricing environment through the business we wrote. Remember though, we pay a penalty in terms of new business to achieve this result. We began to achieve rate in a few areas while rates were essentially flat where the rate of decline slowed in others. For example, in U.S. publicly traded D&O, rates went flat in the second quarter, and we're in fact, up 2% in the third. ","Rate movements for the business we wrote in the quarter vary by territory and market segment. In our U.S. middle-market and U.S. major accounts and specialty businesses, renewal pricing in aggregate was up about 1.5%, with exposure change an additional positive 1%. By major class of business, pricing for our risk management business is up 1.5%. ","General and Specialty Casualty-related pricing was up about 4%. Financial Lines pricing was flat with management liability up 2% and property-related pricing was down about 2.5%.","In our international retail commercial P&C business, pricing for general special -- general and specialty casualty, Financial Lines and property-related rates were all down 2%. For our London wholesale business, property rates were up 1%, and marine, down 2% and Financial Lines, flat.","Now with that as context, let me give you some color on our revenue results for the quarter, which was a stronger on both a published basis and when adjusted for merger noise. Continuing the trend from prior quarter, this was our best quarter since the merger in terms of growth and reflects a careful balance between leveraging, the power, broad capabilities of the organization and underwriting discipline where we will trade market share for an underwriting profit.","For the quarter, P&C net premiums written globally were up over 4.5% in constant dollars. Adjusted for merger-related underwriting actions, they were up 4%. As a reminder, the impact from these merger-related items will continue to ameliorate as we move forward.","In our North America commercial P&C business, net premiums we're down about 0.5%. Normalizing for merger-related actions, they were up 1%. The renewal retention rate for our North America commercial P&C business was steady at 92%, with major account and specialty at 94% and middle market at 88%. Overall new business writings for North America commercial were up about 1.5% over third quarter '16, with new business growth coming from major accounts, middle market, small commercial and Bermuda wholesale. In our North America Personal Lines business, net premiums written were up 18%. Excluding the 13-point impact of a onetime on a premium transfer that reduced premiums written in the prior year, growth was about 5%. Rates were up about 2%, and exposure change added 3%. Retention remains very strong at 95%.","Turning to Overseas General. Net premiums written for international retail P&C were up over 2% in the quarter in constant dollars, and nearly 4% excluding merger-related actions. Latin America led the way with growth of 12% while the U.K. and Ireland had a good quarter with growth of 4%.","Our Asia-focused internationalize Life Insurance business had a very strong quarter with net premiums written and deposits up 28% for the near, year-to-date growth to 18%. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends.","We are in good shape but the remainder of our integration activities, operationally and financially, all areas of integration are on track or ahead of schedule.","Lastly, we're continuing to plant seeds to capitalize on future growth opportunities around the globe. You saw, for example, our recent announcement of a 15-year exclusive distribution agreement with one of Asia's most respected banks, Singapore-based DBS. At the heart of our venture is our joint ability to market and service insurance digitally to DBS customers both consumer and business.","In sum, the company is in great shape and we are optimistic about the future. While it was a tough quarter for cat, again, it's the business we are in. We should be at the beginning of a firming market, and we intend to help lead in that direction. Our company is in great shape from the perspectives of risk management, growth opportunity and financial efficiency. We are investing aggressively in our future Web delivering results to shareholders today.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we'll come back and take your questions.","Philip Bancroft","Thank you, Evan. Due to the unusually high level of catastrophe losses in the quarter, we sustained an operating loss of $60 million or a $0.13 per share. Catastrophe losses totaled over $1.5 billion after-tax or $3.27 per share net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums. ","Our underlying results were strong with current accident year underwriting income, excluding catastrophes, a record $839 million, up over 5.5% from the prior year. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we maintain a necessary liquidity to support our business around the globe with total capital exceeding $63 billion.","Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $563 million to shareholders, including $331 million in dividends and $232 million in shares repurchases. Year-to-date through September 30, our share repurchases have totaled $707 million and our program for the year remains open. Operating cash flow for the quarter was a record $1.8 billion.","As Evan mentioned, book value and tangible book value per share were up 0.5% and down 0.3%, respectively. Our operating loss and capital-related actions in the quarter were offset by positive portfolio returns and favorable currency movements.","Our invested assets grew by $2.2 billion or over 2% for the quarter, reflecting the favorable impact of foreign currency and positive cash flows. ","Investment income of $893 million was a record and higher than expected due to a $44 million distribution from a coinvestment by Chubb with one of the company's private equity fund partners. We now expect our quarterly run rate to be in the range of $845 million to $855 million. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $829 million pretax, and included a $680 million gain from FX and a $223 million gain from the investment portfolio, driven by a slight decline in yields and a positive return on our private equity portfolio.","Our pretax catastrophe losses in the quarter, principally from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were $3 billion gross and $1.9 billion net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums bigger this compared to expected that catastrophe loss for the third quarter of $330 million pretax. Additional information on catastrophe losses as the deal in our financial supplement. Net loss reserves increased over $2.3 billion for the quarter. After adjusting for cat losses, our loss reserves increased $660 million. The paid-to-incurred ratio in the quarter was 69%. Adjusting for cat losses and prior period development, the ratio was 87%. ","We have positive prior period development in the quarter of $270 million pretax or $206 million after-tax. This included $77 million pretax of adverse development for our legacy environmental liability exposure versus $52 million in 2016. The remaining favorable development of $347 million was principally in long-tail lines related to accident years 2012 and prior.","Overall, our favorable prior period development is down compared to last year by $79 million pretax. This is primarily due to the higher environmental charge in 2017, and the fact that 2016 included the release of an individual legacy liability case reserve of $25 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect our combined ratio to be favorable impacted by income level benefits from integration savings at a level similar to the third quarter. By year-end 2017, we will have achieved our full annualized run rate integration-related savings in accordance with the disclosed target of $875 million. As we move through 2018, the relative impact on our combined ratio will dissipate. ","Merger-related underwriting actions were $87 million in the quarter. We expect this to increase modestly in the fourth quarter because it includes the impact of the accounting policy alignment we discussed on this year's first quarter conference call. The merger-related impact on premiums will be pretty substantially beginning in the first quarter of 2018. The operating income tax rate for the quarter was impacted by the high level of catastrophe losses. Excluding catastrophe losses, in excess of our expectations, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.5%. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate excluding the impact of the excess third quarter catastrophes to remain within the 16% to 18% range for the year. I'll turn it back to Helen.","Helen Wilson","Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Evan, on the pricing outlook, some argued that the industries do have plenty of excess capital and that it is a very fragmented marketplace. So what gives you comfort that this is the beginning of a firming market and the potential price increase will be sustainable?","Evan Greenberg","Well, Kai, it's one thing for there to be plenty of capital, but I agree that theres. It's another thing to receive a reasonable return on the capital. And when I -- when you look at industry results, in aggregate, many the industry are not in achieving cost of capital, let alone, a reasonable risk-adjusted return. Combined ratios are under pressure. You take out cat premiums that's subsidized, that mask the underlying health, you get rate going in one direction, the trend going in the other. And so in my judgment, it has reached a point where the industry -- there is enough pressure that I think, all the responsible companies, there is a recognition of that need. And you'd like the market to be -- to behave though markets the markets and hardly, they behave always rationally. But if we were to suppose a rational and responsible industry, you'd like to not have volatility in terms of pricing and terms to customers. ","You'd like it to behave in a more orderly way. And I believe all that bodes towards that direction. The other thing I'd tell you is losses were concentrated. These events weren't just evenly spread. They were concentrated in a number of important places. And those are the market -- the plumbing, the financial plumbing for insurance is global and it is connected. And I think have the loss disproportionately hit some of those centers, London as an example, drives a behavior that has an impact on many other markets at the same time. So while there's no guarantees, that's my point of view.","Kai Pan","Okay, that's great. And my second question, on your revenue growth. The underlying premium growth you said is past -- since merger. And could you quantify -- so how much about is attributable to the revenue opportunities you discussed in the merger? And would a hardly market accelerate the realization of the revenue opportunities?","Evan Greenberg","Well, look, I can put a dollar or a coin estimate on that. The fact is, when you look at the parts and pieces of this organization combined and the complementarity nature of the strengths of what we now have, that is 1 organization, so I'm hardly going to talk about it 2 years on -- in some artificial way of 2 organizations, it's all one. And the complementarity strands and capabilities are simply compelling from a market point of view for customers, whether it is from small commercial to middle-market to large commercial, and whether it is in the United States or it is overseas, or it is for a global customer, no one has the total capability that this organization has in terms of product and service and reputation for delivering. And we are capitalizing on that. And the fact is, where underwriters and we disciplined in underwriting and we will trade growth for underwriting discipline. And then the more the market rationalizes to a reasonable risk-adjusted price for the risk they take, the more opportunity that will create for Chubb. Thank you for the question.","Operator","And we'll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Just following up a little bit, on the market outlook as well. You have insinuated there being about $100 billion of losses this quarter. Now when we look at the disclosures that we'd see to date, where obviously there's a decent size of delta between the losses that are out there and that $100 billion figure. Do we need to see $100 billion, meaning as the losses come in, both the potential and the start of what you said is a firming market -- not be there, I mean how do you view the need to see about $100 billion of losses?","Evan Greenberg","Look, I think I'm not speaking a little too simplistic way. You're just putting a point estimate. So if it's 99, Elyse, what do you think? $101 billion, what do you think? -- excuse me, we're talking circa -- in the range of. And what you always see large cats, if you look back through experience, and let's say, let's take Katrina as an example. What was the initial reported loss by insurers, and what did Katrina ultimately develop to? I recall somewhere in the $30 billion range that ultimately became $42 billion to $45 billion. I think that's what you're seeing here, and I think you're going to continue to see it creep. And it happens over a period of time.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that's great. And I imagine because there's estimates out there now that you can ballpark at to -- maybe $50 billion. I wasn't talking about $1 billion but in terms of pricing just when you think. . .","Evan Greenberg","Well, you pick a number, I'll pick mine. ","Elyse Greenspan","And then what you're talking about pricing in this firmer market, how are you thinking about price specific to really property and certain pricing levels that you think are needed for Chubb to get a lot more aggressive? I mean, how has the dialogue been with been with your clients following on these events in and around the potential to push for more price?","Evan Greenberg","Elyse, in the very early days when you think about the business of housings move and how the business actually works. So in October, you're really quoting late November and December business. In September, your business for October was already done. So there is a lag and it takes time, and that is just building now. The rate increase, I was very clear in my commentary, it varies by customer in the way Chubb will approach this. It doesn't -- it's not some blunt instrument -- here is how much it needs to move. Some customers to make needs to be flat. Some customers need to quote 30% because what's the adequacy? Where are you priced the model on cat, and where are you priced for attritional loss? And that both need to be adequate. ","And overall for the industry, if you're large account shared and layered, you're talking double digit and it has to be. If you're talking middle-market commercial, well, the pricing is going to vary depending on the class and where you are located in the United States, or where you're located overseas. We're underwriters, and so we price to the exposure.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, that's helpful. And then one last for Phil on the tax side. You said 16% to 18%. That's a Q4 and a full year figure?","Philip Bancroft","I was saying general on a quarterly basis, yes. We would expect to run 16% to 18%. Now if you're talking about this year, as I said, that's 16% to 18% excludes the impact of the excess cats in this quarter. So on a normal year, I would say 16% to 18%.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Given the expectations for primary commercial insurance rates, it would seem that reinsurance rates could go up more. Could you talk about how much of its reinsurance protection Chubb already has placed for 2018? Or how much it might purchase next year relative to this year, please?","Evan Greenberg","Our purchase appetite is pretty steady, Jay, and that isn't something that changes in any dramatic way. Our notion of risk and how we see risk has not changed. These cats didn't show us something else about risks that we didn't already know, and that's what I tried to speak to in the beginning, and I think that speaks with -- remember something about reinsurance. If primary gets rate, the reinsurer automatically got rate because excess pricing, when you think about cat protection, is a derivative of the premium that is collected, and that premium is a proxy for the underlying rate and exposure. And so they automatically get rate.","Now you're talking about rate on rate, and how much that will be. And I can't speak to that at this moment in time, it will be pure speculation. Our treaties com up through the year and we already have -- so depending on as they come up through the year, we have treaties that will run for 6 months into '18, 3 months into '18, and 9 months into '18. It all varies. We don't have it all piled into one day.","Jay Gelb","That's what I figured. My next question is on the California wildfires. Can you discuss what you think the industry total insured loss might be and then cats exposure given its market presence in high-net worth homeowners as well is the winery industry?","Evan Greenberg","Sure. Look, I can't speak to the industry loss right now. My own gut feel for it is the numbers that are out there that -- have a reach around them and where -- sorts of coalescences around that $5 billion, it doesn't feel off to me. But I don't know with any certainty. And for Chubb, I'm not going to give you a number because it's too early. It's too early to estimate our lawsuit position but from all we know at the moment, the net loss appears to be in the range of our cat load for the fourth quarter. But again, it's early days. When I say what's the cat load for the fourth quarter, and I'm not going to disclose our cat load for the fourth quarter. We don't do that. But I think you have a way of doing researching into the past.","Jay Gelb","Will the fourth quarter typically be less in the third quarter?","Evan Greenberg","Third quarter right? It's less.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith","A quick question just on the pricing one here. So history, I think, has found, particularly, in the Casualty Line and even in the Property Lines, that firming markets typically follow an increase in the kind of perception of risk in those lines of business or higher loss trends -- something is happening. Do we really have that this time around?","Evan Greenberg","I think we do among a lot of prayers players, I do. Remember you had a lot of nonmodeled risk here, let's take Harvey as an example. Harvey was a rain event. It wasn't a wind event. It was a flood event. And models hardly imagine that. I think when the dust all settles and you look at Maria, the devastation in Puerto Rico, I mean it was -- it was pummeled back to the Stone Age. And the kind of business interruption exposures that can emerge from that, I think, stand up and give people to take attention. When you Irma approaching -- if Irma moves 70 miles east, you were looking at $150 billion. I think people stood up to take attention to that. The number of territories that were, in essence, correlated in single event, in single events, and then in aggregate in the events.","While people understood it theoretically possible, it's another thing when it actually occurs. And it's something about human nature, that when you're taking a bet and you don't lose the bet over years, your perception of risk just has a way of moderating. Humans start to feel almost omnipotent that way. And then, as soon as it hits, isn't it amazing how people feel ? It's not just in catastrophes. It's in any kind of risk-taking. It's just the human condition. And that's what you've got going on. And that's why I started out by saying, it's not my company. And cat losses will stop you crying. This is the business we're in, this is what we do for a living.","Brian Meredith","Got you. And then what do you think about the reaction of the alternative markets or capital markets? And did they put a lid on them -- any type of property pricing, pricing property, cats, those types of things?","Evan Greenberg","Well, we'll see. Look, the retro market was hit very, very hard and both with impaired capital and capital that is tied up because of the big question mark of whether it's impaired or not in the ultimate loss, to Elyse's question, what we've seen reported -- but there will be a big delta between what's been reported. And when you look back a year or 2 years well with the ultimate loss is. And that capital -- a lot of capital was tied up. And how much capital comes back in and based on what kind of return will be expected, which I can guarantee, has a lot higher than to get a return, a lot higher than the rates they took in the past. Well, that's in front of us and it's a short window, because here comes January 1, and reinsurers have to make their plans about how much capacity to commit.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny.","Ian Gutterman","And I have a couple of questions last couple yes. So I guess, Maria -- can you talk about more -- I think the price, that's been everyone's lowest number. I know there's a lot of different range on the industry events but nothing -- it sees for a lot of people, it's half of less of the others. And I would have thought, for a company like yours, frankly, it would've been higher just given your national account exposure. There is almost as many Home Depot's and\/or Walmarts, et cetera, on Puerto Rico as New Orleans, so I guess I'm surprised we're not seeing more national account type losses I would say, if you can't open the doors.","Evan Greenberg","I don't mind telling you that Chubb, fundamentally, overall our company, in the last 2 years, 3 years, we cut our exposure in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico in half or more. We didn't like pricing, we didn't like aggregations and we didn't like terms, period. Number 2, you're referring to big real estate schedules when you're using proxy of the kinds of accounts you named. And by the way, the most underpriced business is big, with the greatest basis risk and exposure is real estate schedules. And any underwriter worth half their salt understand that. So that's how I commented on based on Chubb. I can't comment that, I can't comment for you based on others.","And on one hand, I scratch my head a little bit but on the other hand, what they do know is, many simply don't have good data yet. They don't know. And unlike us, they're not on the ground with people actually examining the exposure with -- through the eyes of experienced adjusters and with that kind of command and control around it. And I think there will be a surprise. I think business interruption when -- time will tell, and I could be wrong, but I think business interruption is going to be uglier at Maria than you imagined, through the obvious reasons -- electricity, ports and transportation, ability to operate.","Brian Meredith","Exactly, that's why I'm worried about. I'm glad you're not on it but I'm worried that others are. On your cat look, I'm doing some very back of the envelop math, which is maybe a little bit unfair. But I think I'm wondering, so said -- I guess I'm wondering do these events make you rethink your annual cat load just -- you said this is a 1-in-5 to 1 in 10, and it also, I think [indiscernible] 330s and normal Q3, so over 10 years, that would be $3.3 billion, you had a $1.9 billion every 7 years, that's about $2.9 billion with nothing in the other years. So again, that's a little bit changes using in Q3, but do these sort of return periods make you rethink what your normal cat load should be?","Evan Greenberg","No. It was actually -- and it depends -- look, are you talking AALs, or are you talking expected that in a normal year? And so there's different basis for thinking about it, number 1. And number 2, as I said, a 1 and 5 to a 1 in 10, and it fits within our expectation as we model the aggregations and what our appetite would be at various return periods based upon our losses as percentage of capital, as a percentage of earnings and as a percentage of industry as we imagine industry. These losses don't throw us. I know what you want me to square for you on this call, and I'm not falling into a math with you. I'll rapidfire back-and-forth math.","Ian Gutterman","I can move on. So to build up on Brian's point about sort of a -- what -- the magnitude we might be seeing here, I guess to me, the question is 2005 versus 2011, right, and you could argue 2011, we haven't seen many quakes in a year? And some of those quakes were in places where the quakes were in the quakes maps, right? I mean those were significant surprises. And you had a tight flood, maybe that's like the wildfires being the final gut punch. And yet, all you really got was localized pricing. And I guess I'm just sort of going through sort of supply-demand and listen to all the calls so far.","The companies had much bigger losses than you, none of them are as saying they're retreating. They're all saying that they are looking to maintain their net and grow their gross. So no one's pulling out. The alternative guys certainly are looking to reload. And as the models aren't changing and the rating agencies aren't changing, it doesn't necessarily seem there's more demand. So if the demand is the same, the capacity at least the same, if not more, I just struggle with outside of obviously where there's been losses, why this is in 2011 like where it makes sense should be pricing, but at the end of the day, there's just too many people who want to grow and none of the people are go and paying.","Evan Greenberg","Ian, there's your thesis. I don't agree with you, and I gave you my thesis.","Ian Gutterman","Nothing else you want to add to that?","Evan Greenberg","I'm not going to -- I don't think I'm going to repeat myself. I'm comfortable where I am. And by the way, I'm looking at property prices already moving. I have and you can't. Now time will tell. Time will tell. I think the industry's reserve position is tighter than it was back in '11. I think the published results x cat are under a lot more pressure than they were, and I've given you all my rationale.","Ian Gutterman","Well, it makes sense. We'll have to see how it plays out.","Evan Greenberg","No. We don't need to debate it. We just need to get on. Hey, Ian, I'm not going to give me an answer. I can only be wrong. I told you what I imagined, I told you what -- if we can have anything to do with crafting the reality, the reality we're going to craft.","Operator","And then we'll go next to Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","A couple of small ball questions, if I can. One, let me start with Phil. So the guidance that you gave for investment fee income, we've seen it straight kind of sneak up in the past couple of months. Does that anticipate a continuation of that trend, or is this based on current levels?","Philip Bancroft","Well, it's a current view of our short-term rate. We update the run rate periodically, and we think that it's a -- based on the cash flow that we expect, and we do an analysis to estimate what we think our -- what we estimate as our investment income for the upcoming quarters.","Evan Greenberg","Yes. Let me just add. That's this just for the fourth quarter. So for that, for higher rates to pike, it's going to take a while. So as we look forward, yes, we would anticipate some increase in rates and that will affect income as we go forward the next few quarters.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that's helpful. And can you talk to the adverse development in North America personal?","Philip Bancroft","Yes, [indiscernible] going well, for sure. As we had adverse PPD of $32 million, PRS in Q3, that was a -- some unfavorable loss development in homeowners, a little bit of an offset to that from the umbrella. That compares to $30 million in the third quarter of 2016. Recall here, Meyer, that we're harmonizing the 3 books of business and this is a huge portfolio. It's in the homeowners line. It's short-tail, very short-tail, and you just a little bit of movement on some of these losses. So nothing what I would [indiscernible] noise.","Evan Greenberg","That's all in the prior prayer but I'm going to help you, Meyer. Okay, we saw the loss ratio in the current accident year also continue to go up in personal. So, why? I'm being your lawyer, Meyer.","Philip Bancroft","That's a great question, Evan, and I don't consider that a small mall. I consider that a big bowl. The Personal Lines current accident year loss ratio excluding cats is $51.9 billion in Q3. While at 51.9, Evan, I think, you and I would agree, that's still a good number, it is 2.6 Meyer than Q3 2016 comp, which was a at 49.3, and that is [indiscernible] higher than where we target the business to run.","Evan Greenberg","The causes of that elevated loss ratio were more large random fires than expected as well as an increase in water damage claims specifically versus fire.thicken given the high severity of low frequency nature of large fire losses, we anticipate random differences in the quarter-to-quarter impact. As you often say, it is our business. As I have mentioned in the past, we have been experiencing an elevated level of losses reversed pipes. We believe these water losses are on industry issue and are not isolated to us. We'll burst pipe losses typically cause us less than home fires, they're incredibly inconvenient for the homeowner and oftentimes, require them to be out of their homes for a period of time. Fortunately, no other carrier has more high-net worth home beta than us, and we have a proactive program to directly reach homeowners we've identified and more likely to have a water loss.","We arm our customers with facts, and we give them practical advice in how to mitigate their chances of loss. We provide them with list of qualified professionals who can install devices such as sensors, water softeners and especially automatic shutoff valves. And of course, once these devices are installed, we provide them with the premium credits because of their improve price. So it's still early days for this proactive program. Our ages and brokers are excited about it and readily embracing it. In fact, they like being advocates for tangible tools to reduce risks and rates. This is part of the Chubb high net worth advantage that so different sheets us in the market.","Meyer Shields","And final question with a little bit of dead horse-beating. But Evan, you talked about mechanic of the leadership position that you have that have been take in terms of driving equipment.","Evan Greenberg","Yes. It's in some ways, a continuation of our playbook, we just can't give up. And it's how you -- it's how -- it's the command-and-control effect of underwriting management. So on one hand, it's how you -- its materials used to educate customers of why you need rate increases and riders, mathematically, the logic behind your statements and your actions. And that is to educate both the customer and your distribution partners and prepare the environment. At the same time then, it's how you train and arm your underwriters, many of whom have never been in an environment where they asked for a rate increase. They will be provided rate decreases and they're the ones on the front end.","For those of you who are not in the business, and you're not, you just observe the business, this is one of the reasons why it takes time for markets to move because the way from the head to tail, to those actually have to administer it on a daily transaction-by-transaction basis, the command-and-control to get them to move takes -- can take time. We understand that and we're usually quicker. And it's getting our underwriters, therefore, and training them and helping them work alongside others who've done it before and being able to actually experience getting a rate increase and that you can do it and you can ask for it. Sounds simple? Not as simple as you might imagine. And then to reinforce that, what you do is you start changing underwriting authorities and you say I'm only giving you of no authority to quote less than x. Any if you're going to quote less the x as an increase, it has to -- it needs approval. It has to go up to manager.","And you limit the number of managers who have that authority to move off of your stated instructions. And that has a way of putting discipline within an organization. So that's just an example to, the kinds of tools and how you do it and you get out there in a very granular way to drive execution of something like this. We've done it before and we know how to do that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen","I was wondering if you could talk about the tax proposals that are floating around Washington. We don't have a lot of specifics yet but you probably have some view -- and also help that could affect Chubb given the complex Chubb's tax arrangements.","Evan Greenberg","Yes. I won't comment directly because -- on the proposals right now, because this is -- you've got house constructing their views of tax and details in proposals, and they look at paying for us et cetera and then Senate doing the same. But let me -- but thank you for the question. I want to make a few other comments and observations none of this that I think important at this moment. And there's been a lot of noise recently from protectionists U.S. insurers. We are seeking the upset to global insurance markets that is working well for U.S. consumers. They want to stop competition from foreign insurers who help keep rates down and they were providing the majority of the cash that is sprinklings from let's take the recent hurricanes. U.S. insurers claim they are suffering compared to foreign insurers because of tax laws. Well this is fundamentally untrue.","If you look at their stock prices over the last decade, shareholders of U.S. insurers, including Berkeley and Travelers have been richly rewarded over the last decade. Just compare a cohort of U.S. insurers and foreign insurers, and you'll see dramatic difference in how much more the U.S. insurers have improved their stock prices. And when they're not running the Congress, to limit foreign competition, they are telling shareholders in the public just how well they are doing, just read their annual reports and listen to their analyst calls, it's a litany of market successes and bright futures. They also make false claims about insurance jobs moving overseas and decreasing tax revenues. In fact, look at what Chubb has done. It is invested for growth in the U.S.","As return signal from a money loser into a profitable taxpaying company, securing the jobs of thousands of employees -- and we used our capital to combine Ace and Chubb, we created a powerful competitor, offering U.S. customers and their array of new products and efficiencies while rewarding shareholders of the same time. And increasing revenue and payrolls means an expanded U.S. tax base, bringing in more personal and corporate tax at all levels of government. While Chubb was investing in the U.S., what were U.S. companies, like Berkeley and Travelers' doing, complaining about decreasing market share while using their capital to buy back stock, maybe boosting their share prices as a result, but failing to make the investments that are essential for long-term growth and creating more jobs.","They know that the strategy doesn't work against companies like Chubb, which are investing in innovation and growth. So they want to slow us down by changing the tax rules and protect their market share at the customers' expense. The current tax system, including the rules about affiliate REIT makes sense because it's -- recognizes the tax should be applied where the risk reside and that system has encourage global distribution of risks, which maximizes the efficient use of capital, resulting in more competition and lower premiums. But you don't have to take my word that this system works to benefit customers and not as the tax avoidance scheme, the U.S. insurers have fantasized. The OECD looked at the tax avoidance question and they would be sceptical of any industry claims. And they concluded that affiliate reinsurance has a legitimate business purpose.","And the U.S. Treasury Department also concluded that affiliate REIT is an important tool, allowing insurers to lower overall costs by pulling capital. So don't be fooled by claims of the U.S. insurers were trying to hide behind the falls patriotism and trade themselves in the flag. They are not interested in lowering costs for U.S. customers. They want to blow up the system that has worked so well to keep prices competitive in the United States. Thank you, Jay for that question.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","I wanted to dovetail a little with the Meyer asked about jumpering leadership. You guys have done a phenomenal job here, broking even in $100 billion loss last quarter. You were -- combined ratios, underlying basis are about 100 basis points better than they were three years ago. Interest rates were higher for pricing. It looks like another situation maybe for you, and maybe not the industry. Why is Chubb invested in this secret rate? Why don't let others make mistakes and allow you to capitalize on their mistakes as they come to you? Does Chubb need to be the one to demonstrate the leadership on the rates pricing?","Evan Greenberg","Well, yes. I think Chubb and I think others will do as they think is in the interest of their own company. I know we'll do what's in the interest of our company. Josh, there are many -- you're looking at the broken egg in it and it's a global book you're looking at. You don't see the underlying parts and pieces as I do. And I know in the large commercial business, and I know in pockets of all of our commercial business, the different classes and the different customer segments and where we are running a combined ratio that is adequate to earn a decent risk-adjusted return and where it is not. And we have many classes that other under pressure. They may earn an underwriting profit but their combined ratios are too high. It is inadequate to earn a reasonable risk-adjusted return.","And by the way, as I always say, we pay a penalty in terms of growth by maintaining underwriting discipline, particularly in those classes, in any class as it approaches inadequacy. And then what you know is, trend continues, it just marches on minute by minute, day by day. And you need, if you want, you want to get out of that. You want to stay ahead of the. And what you don't want to do, and I don't want to see happen -- I care about our industry because I care about our industry's reputation and what customers don't want ultimately it's volatility in pricing. They want more predictability. And so all of that success to me, when you add it all together between opportunity, between the in between responsible behavior in an industry that is importance to the plumbing of our economy, that we behave in a responsible rational way, so prices should I need to.","Helen Wilson","Thank you, everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you, and good day.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Chubb Limited\u2019s Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Helen Wilson","Thank you, and welcome to our June 30, 2017 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to Company performance, investment income, pricing and business mix, economic and market conditions and integration of the Chubb Corporation acquisition and potential synergies and expense savings. All of these are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent SEC filings and earnings press release and financial supplements, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.","We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement, which are available at investors.chubb.com. In particular all references to 2016 underwriting results will be on as it basis which excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustment related to the merger.","Now I would like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer, then we will take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.","Evan Greenberg","Good morning. Chubb had a very good quarter, we produced strong earnings that were driven by world-class underwriting and record investment income. After tax operating income for the quarter was $1.2 billion or $2.50 per share compared to two and a quarter per share prior year up 11%. For the six months of this year operating income was up 13% from 2016.","Our combined ratio for the quarter was simply excellent, 88% compared to 90.2% last year. And it benefited from a substantial improvement in the expense ratio of about 1.5 point as well as lower catastrophe losses.","Total P&C underwriting income of $808 million was up 20%. The current accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses for the quarter was outstanding at 87.5%, again almost 1.5 points better than the last year, driven by integration of related expense savings that benefited both the expense ratio and the loss ratio. Those savings plus a loss adjustment expense reserve release mitigated a rise in the underlying current accident year loss ratio of 1.2 points.","Given the market conditions and the fact that we are in a multi-year soft insurance market, these results are truly distinguishing and clearly demonstrate the benefits of our global capabilities. Our portfolio construction and underwriting management, hallmarks of our Company, they also speak to the quality and talent of my outstanding colleagues around the world, our culture of excellence and craftsmanship at all levels of the organization.","Net investment income for the quarter was a record $855 million, above the guidance we gave you last quarter and up about 5% over prior year. Philip will explain why we exceeded recent guidance.","Chubb\u2019s strong earnings produced a good operating ROE of about 10% for the quarter while for the six months period per share book and tangible book value have grown 4.4% and 7.6% respectively and they have increased about 12.5% and 20% since the merger closing in January of last. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, cats and prior period reserve development.","The commercial P&C market is with a few exceptions soft globally, though conditions vary depending on territory, line of business and size of risk. Most areas of the commercial P&C market are soft and highly competitive as many companies reach for growth.","As noted in the prior quarters, large account business particularly shared and layered remains very competitive, though pricing maybe beginning to bottom. On the other hand, middle market business with the exception of commercial auto continues to grow more competitive by the quarter.","Wholesale remains more competitive than retail, particularly in short tail lines. In wholesale certain stressed casualty classes are beginning to get rate, not enough to produce adequate returns, but nonetheless improving.","Globally new business has been hard to come-by and what simply can be described as a hungry market. Competitive new business conditions are ameliorated for us to some degree when it\u2019s about more than rate and we bring the power of the organization to bear for a client or producer.","In the quarter 11% of North America retail commercials, P&Cs new business and 6% of our international new business came from cross-selling and the power of the organization.","Also our total capabilities in terms of product, service reputation, ability to serve many different types of insurance customers, our deep distribution capability and extensive geography reach means our optionality or ability to capitalize on opportunity is exceptional, it will only improve with time. I will point to a few examples later.","With that as backdrop, the good news is for the business we wrote the trend for pricing improved, rates were essentially flat or the rate of declines slowed in comparison to recent quarters. And in some stress classes we were able to achieve rate, such as U.S. commercial auto, Australian property and [D&O] (Ph), Mexican auto where we are large players and U.S. ENS casualty.","In U.S. D&O class that needs rates as we noted on our last call, pricing for the business we wrote went flat. As we projected revenue growth for the quarter continue to trend better on both the publish basis and when adjusted for merger noise. In fact this was our best quarter since the merger in terms of growth.","However, with the exception of our risk management business which had nice growth and continue to benefit from a flight to quality and capability, we wrote less new business trading new business growth for better terms and we lost business for price we weren\u2019t loosing by a few points.","Our overall renewal retention in the quarter was steady and that was true among the various lines of business with the exception of one that we have discussed before, which is North America property and casualty coverage for real estate related risks. The tough class where Chubb has been leader.","In the quarter, P&C net premiums written globally were flat in constant dollars. Foreign exchange had about a 0.5 percentage point impact, adjusted for merger related underwriting actions in reinsurance P&C net premiums were up over 2.5%. As a reminder the impact from these merger related items has and will continue to ameliorate as we move through the year.","Rate movement for the business we wrote in the quarter varied by territory and market segments. Renewal rates were down about a 0.5% in our U.S. middle market business, with exposure change a positive 1%.","In our U.S. major accounts business, renewals pricing was down about a 0.5% and exposure change with an additional negative 0.5%. In our international retail commercial P&C business pricing was down one, again overall these were the best rate results we have seen in quite a few quarters for the business we wrote.","By major class of business beginning with North America, retail general and specialty casualty related pricing was down about a 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down about a 0.5% with D&O flat and property related pricing was down one.","Internationally, general and specialty casualty related pricing was down 2%. Financial lines pricing was flat and property related pricing was down 3%. The UK commercial P&C market remains highly competitive, but overall we achieved better pricing with rates mostly flat.","The continent of Europe on the other hand became marginally more competitive. In Australia we achieved meaningful rate in property and DNO a rationale sign for what is a very competitive market. The balance of Asia and most of Latin America largely remain status quo in terms of pricing trend.","Now with that as context, let me give you some more detail on revenue results for the quarter. In our North America commercial P&C business, net premiums were down 1.3%. Normalizing for merger related underwriting, net premiums were up about 1.5% and the renewal retention ratio for retail was at 88%.","Overall new business writings for North America commercial lines were up about 3.5% over second quarter 2016. Again with the exception of risk management, we wrote less new business than prior year. The trade we are not happy to make, but we will take all day long to secure adequate underwriting terms.","In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were up 2%. Excluding the six point impact of additional reinsurance growth was 8%. Rates were up 2% and exposure change added 3%. Retention remains very strong at about 95%.","Turning to our overseas, general insurance operations, net premiums written for international retail P&C business were up about one and a quarter in the quarter in constant dollars and over 3% excluding underwriting action. As a few highlights, Asia-Pac, Asia-Pacific commercial P&C business was up 9% on the back of Australia and New Zealand.","Japan P&C was up 12%, Latin America [A&E] (Ph) was up 11.5% and international personal lines were up over 9%. Mexico continues to be a bright spot for us, up strong double-digits overall for the quarter. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends.","We are in good shape with the remainder of our integration activity, operationally and financially, all areas of integration are on-track or ahead of schedule. As you saw in the press release, we have now increased the total annualized run rate savings we will achieve by the end of 2018 to $875 million, up from $800 million, which is up from the original $650 million when we announce the merger.","These savings are directly contributing to our margins in the phase of declining rates and continuing loss cost trends while giving us room to invest in our competitive profile, including our technology, our talent, new lines of business and future operating efficiency. We are investing substantial sums, talent and time in positioning this Company to be a leader in a digital age, because the economy globally is digitizing.","This includes our organization structure, cycle times of change, expertise and skill sets of our people, data and analytics, robotics, the front-end customer experience to the customer back-end claims experience and the very definition of the products we sell. This is not just strategy, we are quietly executing.","In closing, we are operating in a highly competitive P&C market and navigating it well. There is no other Company better diversified and positioned with the breadth of capabilities, culture, talent, broad distribution and presence around the world that we have today at Chubb.","We have built and are building a revenue machine. Governed however by our underwriting discipline and it gives us great confidence and optionality in uncertain times and makes us more relevant to our customers and business partners. The entire organization is intently focused on execution, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to outperform.","With that, I will turn the call over to Phil and then we will back to take your questions.","Philip Bancroft","Thank you Evan. Chubb\u2019s overall financial position grew stronger in the quarter as we continue to generate substantial capital and positive cash flow. We have a very strong balance sheet to support our business around the globe with total capital exceeding $63 billion.","We grew our tangible book value per share by 4.3% in the quarter. Concerning tangible book value per share growth, you will remember that at the close of our merger the initial dilution to our tangible book value per share was 29%, since then we have reduced that dilution to about 10%.","Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $667 million to shareholders including $332 million in dividends and $335 million in shares repurchased. Year-to-date though June 30, our share repurchases have totaled 475 million.","Investment income of $855 million was a record and was $20 million higher than our expectations. Half of that increase was due to higher than estimated private equity distributions and the other half from increased call activity in our corporate bond portfolio.","Net realized and unrealized gain for the quarter was $747 million pre-tax and include a $588 million gain from the investment portfolio primarily from decreases in interest rates and gains from our private equity portfolio. We have also had $116 million gain from FX and an $80 million gain in our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio.","Net loss reserves increased $226 million for the quarter. The pace of incurred ratio in the quarter was 99%. Adjusting for cat losses and prior period development, the ratio was 95%. We had positive prior period development in the quarter of $170 million pre-tax, about a $144 million after-tax.","This include a $43 million pre-tax of adverse development related to our run-off non-A&E casualty exposures, which is included in corporate, and $57 million pre-tax favorable development relating to our industrial accident workers\u2019 compensation coverage from the 2016 accident year.","The remaining favorable development was split 40% long tail lines principally for the 2012 and prior accident years and 60% short tail lines. Our catastrophe losses in the quarter were 200 million or a $152 million after-tax compared to $390 million or $311 million after-tax in the prior year. Catastrophe losses this quarter were primarily from U.S. weather related events.","Integration realized and annualized run rate savings are ahead of expectation. Total incremental integration related savings realized in the quarter were a $105 million leading to total inception to-date realized savings of $554 million. On an annualized run rate basis, savings through June are $775 million.","As Evan noted, we now expect to achieve annualized run rate savings of $875 million by the end of 2018 up from our prior estimate of $800 million. We are also expecting integration and merger related expenses to be $903 million up from our prior estimate of $809 million.","As we disclosed in our press release the benefit of these integration related savings is reflected in our combined ratio. Our combined ratio in the quarter reflected the incremental impact of integration related savings of $104 million, a $45 million benefit related to the harmonization of the Company\u2019s pension and retiree healthcare plans and the release of loss adjustment expense reserves of $30 million. These favorable items was partially offset by increased spending to support growth and the impact of salary increases and inflation.","We noted in the fourth quarter of 2016 that we expect the incremental annualized impact of our U.S. retirement plan harmonization to be approximately $100 million pre-tax. Through six months we have realized $80 million, the remaining $20 million is expected to be recognized in the second half of 2017.","The operating income tax rate for the quarter is 16%, which is at the low end of our expected range, principally due to a higher level of catastrophe losses occurring in the U.S. we expect our annual effective tax rate to remain within 16% to 18% range for the remainder of the year.","I will turn the call back over to Helen.","Helen Wilson","Thank you. At this point, we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will go first question to Ryan Tunis, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis","Hey thanks. I guess my first question was just thinking about these merger related underwriting actions in reinsurance. I guess at this point, it\u2019s a pretty substantial number and I guess the way we see it, so far it feels like it\u2019s only shown up in the form of lower net written premium, I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s the right interpretation or there is other price if that we are seeing it, whether it\u2019s like the was the cat load lower this quarter than it would have been as you not done that. Is there a meaningful free up in capital or is it actually serving as a pretty major tailwind on like the expense ratio and a loss ratio just any help on that would be useful? Thanks.","Evan Greenberg","Yes. Well first of all you wouldn\u2019t be able to see it in the cat load, because we don\u2019t give guidance. So you don\u2019t actually know what our cat load is, but as an example we have told you this before, first of all you get the annualized impact of reinsurance it has to run its course. So we bought a quota share treaty last year, Northeast quota share it\u2019s also in our Qs and Ks. And we bought that and we were very clear - I\u2019m giving you one example, in third quarter last year that the trade-off of premium versus buying straight cat access on a risk reward basis made much more sense to us and that did lower our cat profile as one example.","Secondly, merger related underwriting actions both for concentration exposure on a per risk or a cat basis as well as portfolio that haven\u2019t met our underwriting standards of making a reasonable underwriting return. When you look at the accident year loss ratio it is benefiting and that it is in fact flat year-on-year.","That\u2019s illogical when you think about rate and trend. Mathematically, it\u2019s not possible, if you are mathematically on us. However, what ameliorates that what ameliorates it is expense savings and also underwriting actions that we have taken merger related that help to ameliorates that. I hope that answers your question.","Ryan Tunis","That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess my follow-up is just on some of your commentary about the competitive environment. I think you said shared and layered remains competitive though pricing is beginning to bottom. On the other hand middle market is becoming more competitive. I guess at this point in the cycle, what do you think is driving that the economy and what do you think it\u2019s going to take for the middle market in particular I guess to reach the bottom and the new business to become more attractive? Thanks.","Evan Greenberg","Yes. Well, large account and shared and layered has been competitive for longer. I mean, they have been both rate and trends that\u2019s be gridding on for a few years between the wholesale market feeding it and the direct retail market and reinsurers. All participants have been involved in the competitive environment there and it has been going on.","At some point, what happens? Losses start coming in, broader terms and conditions, they start catching up to pricing and combined ratios rise, you see it. It\u2019s not hiding itself. And that eventually causes rates to begin to flatten out. Not necessarily in a place to that [equip] (Ph), but the first thing I have to do start flattening out. So market wares itself out at some point.","In the middle market, the middle market is always more orderly than the large account particularly shared and layered. And that began late, that has just only began in the last number of quarters to become more competitive where companies are trying to reach for growth.","Economic growth is reasonably slow and companies are reaching for more growth, because they don\u2019t have another way to go and as you are seeing EPS and that will go for a little while. It is my sense. I don\u2019t see a catalyst excepted really combined ratios underwriting cash flow. So Ryan, I can\u2019t forecast the future, I sit with a crystal ball, but my sense is, it\u2019s more competitive and it will remain that way for a little while.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Good morning. My first question is on the premium growth. I appreciate all the color in terms of merger and the reinsurance. Evan you mentioned obviously the increase reinsurance to place last year starting in the third quarter. So when we kind of tie together your commentary about the market and how you see the business. Are we reaching the point when the third quarter of this year on an ex-currency basis, we should start to see your growth in that premium written?","Evan Greenberg","You know we don\u2019t give forward guidance, but I don\u2019t see a reason why the trend that we are seeing in our underlying growth doesn\u2019t continue and merger-related underwriting actions will continue to ameliorate as the year goes along. And you are correct there was a large - last year not only did we buy it, we also did an [un-urged] (Ph) premium transfer that also impacted net written premium at that time. So you are correct it was more penalty last year.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then in terms of revenue synergies, first off if you could just get a number for the quarter? And then second, Evan I know in the past you had kind of tied your long-term view just to kind of give a ballpark figure to at least being equal to level of expenses for the deal in terms of revenue synergies. The expense saves has been increased, does your view on revenue synergies also increased, and if you can just talk high level about the revenue synergies that have come about to-date compared to your expectations?","Evan Greenberg","Yes, and remember what I spoke to was a - I don\u2019t have my exact words in front of me, but that we have revenue, we would have expense saves that translated to operating income and that we would have income from additional revenue opportunities that would approach some proportional either equal or within a range.","I haven\u2019t changed my view on the revenue side, we haven\u2019t really top stated that frankly to look forward in the next two or three years about that. All things being equal, the revenue synergies that we have projected remain on-track. We are growing the small commercial business, we said that would take years to occur. That is happening.","We said that we would gain in middle market around the globe and small commercial around the globe. That is on-track. We have been planting the seeds for that and placing and building operations in targeted markets around the world that will feed that growth.","We said cross-selling and that by really important cross-selling the strength in the organization, bringing more products to the distribution in North Americas fast middle market capabilities that we haven\u2019t shut and that is happening. We are driving that and we can measure that, whether it is cyber insurance, environment liabilities, specialty casualty, international coverages for middle market companies, we are seeing that. We can measure that.","And on the other side of coin, the governor in a little it for us is underwriting, because it\u2019s a soft market with a lot of headwind and that\u2019s what governs it the other way. Sometimes you get more joy through the effort, sometimes you get less, we stay steady.","Elyse Greenspan","And the number of\u2026","Evan Greenberg","And we told you that 11% to the new business and 6% of new business and I think Phil.","Philip Bancroft","We have for the quarter a 110 million of gross written premiums that relates to that.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, perfect. And one last question. Can just give a little bit of color on what will be adverse development within your North America personal line segment in the quarter?","Evan Greenberg","Yes, I\u2019m going to give that to Paul Krump, who was waiting for you to ask that question.","Paul Krump","Good morning Elyse thank you Evan. Let me unpack this a little bit for you Elyse. The second quarter PPD amounts reflects unfavorable vast development from a combination of prior period tax, wreck marine and auto liability.","Let me just dispose the wreck margin quickly, because that was one single claim. When you think about of cats, that was about a third of the amount and the third was coming from auto liability.","Recall Elyse that we brought together legacy ace, firemen\u2019s fund in Chubb and in doing so we have integrated the reserving processes for all three companies and we have also then brought together a far more credible data than we previously had available for automobile. And that data has caused us to increase our expectations slightly on some portions of the book.","Now recall, though that this is over several actions years and just that about a third of the amount of PPD is the raise in the auto. So it\u2019s very much a de-minimums amount and I think it\u2019s important to note that that data pegs our thinking about pricing and our underwriting moving forward.","Operator","We will go next to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. First question on the cost savings target and where is the - Phil can you could talk more about where the $75 million additional cost savings come from and how much you plan to reinvestment in that business, how much do you think can flow through that bottom line?","Philip Bancroft","Yes well, you are already seeing it flow through the bottom line substantially and we are investing in the business as I gave you on the commentary. Where it comes from is spread broadly across the organization, its fundamentally not in the underwriting units or in sales and marketing, its more in support operations and it is personal cost related, it is outside services related, it is IT related and it\u2019s to some degree real estate related.","Kai Pan","Okay. Then my second question and follow-up on the reserve side. I also had a personal eye in the North American commercial business also see a year-over-year slowing down in terms of reserve releases. Just wondering if you can provide additional sort of color on that?","Evan Greenberg","Yes, it was a positive reserve release, which speaks to strength of our reserves. Our prior period reserve development has variability, it varies by quarter. It depends on the reserve studies that we do in the quarter and which we do, we study all major lines through the year and quarter-to-quarter though this variability depends on what you did study.","Again our reserves are strong, the first quarter I will remind you was essentially flat with prior year, I think it was down $10 million or $15 million bucks. I can\u2019t predict the future, I don\u2019t know future trends, frequency and severity versus the inputs we use to create our reserves in any given line of business. But again, what I\u2019m very comfortable with this, our reserves are quite strong.","Kai Pan","Thank you for that. And if I may just one, quick one. You see unfavorable releasing unallocated claims, handling expense contribute to the loss ratio improvements the one point. Is that one-off?","Evan Greenberg","Well, it can be. Yes, we studied it every year and\/or more than once a year, we look at what we put away for future claim development. And so like any other reserve, we study that and this quarter, the actual projected and what we have seen as trend versus what we are holding reserve, resulted in the release. I can tell you, last year when we did second quarter review, we also had a reserve release then on unallocated loss adjustments expense. But I can\u2019t predict the future of that, it\u2019s not like well, it\u2019s just as, you are going to harvest a reserve release in UA area, you don\u2019t know that, you can\u2019t project it.","Kai Pan","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Gelb, Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Good morning. I was hoping, you could comment on the recent favorable trends that\u2019s been identified in the slowdown, in the number of law suits being filed in state courts and whether that would have a positive trend on Chubb\u2019s loss cost inflation?","Evan Greenberg","We have seen the same thing that is slowed, we read the same headlines you read and we see that out there. We haven\u2019t noticed it, particularly in our casualty loss costs development. Though, I can say that in general casualty in particular reserve releases have come from trends lower than we projected, so that is a fact.","On the other hand, when you look at litigation related to directors and officers, there is no improvement in that area, and in fact frequency and severity have worsened. The article that you read refer to general litigation of nuisance suits and others in that where Americans would freely reach for a legal remedy to any misfortune that came to them, that there is a decline in that. That you don\u2019t see in directors and officers.","Jay Gelb","I appreciate that. And then more broadly given all the back and forth we are seeing from the administration, on various topics. I thought, you could help us out by updating us on your views around tax and trade?","Evan Greenberg","You want to get me in trouble. Don\u2019t you? My views remain as they were. For our country and for our economy to reach its full potential which it is not right now. We need tax reform, we need infrastructure, the state of infrastructure in our country is shameful, and is a competitive disadvantage and we are somehow lackadaisical about that.","I can tell you, I travel around the world, you go to China, you go to other countries that are growing near economies and will grow their economies more rapidly than us, their infrastructure is far superior and that is a tax on us.","Regulation, deregulating is so important. An awful lot of this requires legislation and we need an administration that is focused, that is working with Congress and we need a Congress that comes together to address these issues of our country. There is just no doubt about it.","When it comes to trade, I stand firm, our country has benefited substantially, in particular NAFTA and it is a competitive advantage to our country. And that agreement is up for negotiations right now to modernize it.","And I\u2019m hopeful and I believe there are so many in the administration who understand it that it is important for us to modernize it and to recognize the benefit to our citizens that all three countries gain parties to NAFTA from NAFTA. It makes a competitive North America in a global marketplace.","Jay Gelb","Thanks very much.","Operator","We will next to Sarah DeWitt, JP Morgan.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the agriculture business. How you are looking in that business, it seems like through conditions are worsening. So any color you could give on what is going on there would be helpful?","Evan Greenberg","I\u2019m going to turn it over to solve it to farmer John Lupica.","John Lupica","Yes thanks.","Evan Greenberg","But you are obsessing in that about the western part of the Corn Belt and not the eastern part.","John Lupica","Yes, Sarah thanks. It\u2019s John. So yes our early focus this year was on winter wheat and the growing conditions for the spring crop that you mentioned. Right now the winter wheat appears to be in line with our expectation, which is good news. And then the planting acreage may have dropped a little bit, but we expect that to show itself when we see the final revenue come out from the spring crops.","And as for the spring crops, as you know we are in the midst of the growing season now. So we don\u2019t have final, final look at it. The weather was a bit wet early in the season, but late in the summer we have seen the Western Corn Belt get hot and dry. So we are watching that. We can certainly use some rain outlast. The Eastern Corn Belt is doing terrific, and that looks to be in better shape.","So right now we are watching the pattern. There is nothing out there that leads us to believe that we wouldn\u2019t have anything about an average year. And I will just remind you, last year was just one of the best we had ever seen in this business.","Sarah DeWitt","Great, thank you. That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","We will go next to Ian Gutterman with Balyasny.","Ian Gutterman","Great, thanks. If I could start Phil with just a follow-up on [indiscernible], first that 30 million shot in PPD or is it just from the regular loss ratio and then secondly was it concentrated in any one line which is spread across all the different segments.","Philip Bancroft","First of all we consider that current accident years, not in PPD. Paul would you say there was any concentration?","Paul Krump","That segment North American commercial.","Philip Bancroft","Yes North America commercial, but [indiscernible].","Ian Gutterman","Okay make sense. I guess as on personal lines growth the 8% sort of adjusted is a pretty strong results, obviously it sounds like a decent part of that is rate and exposure, but it seems like there are some maybe accelerating unit growth as well. Can you just talk about what is driving that, its obliviously a tough time at least on the auto side. I know it\u2019s a smaller part of the book, but for peers are you finding opportunities to take business from people or is it mostly the home driving I was just curious?","Philip Bancroft","First , I would say this to you. our auto book is not a huge book, we are not a general auto market rider and we are earning in underwriting profit in automobile. We had unit growth in the quarter, we wrote double-digit number of new policies. Some of that is multiple policies on a customer and so we would say high-single thousands or mid-single thousands of new policy count.","We are trying to get a handle better data on buying policies backed in customers in aggregate and making sure we have that exactly right, so I don\u2019t wanted to misspeak about that. But we are gaining grip and our growth is coming in all three areas, we are getting it from the mass affluent, we are getting it from the higher segments of high net worth, all the way up to very high net worth both number of customers, but as well their own exposures grow as they acquire more assets, homes, et cetera and we are up selling there.","I\u2019m pleased with the progress we are making in personal lines, I can tell you as you get it, it\u2019s like talking about small commercial, it comes in small bites, it take a long time to effect change that really shows in numbers in a significant way, but I like the way our marketing in sales is organized in our field operations, I like how we are being able to now begin to target county-by-county of the United States, where our target market is and beginning to put in place the capabilities in the sales and agent process to be able to target those customers to go after.","That\u2019s not a six months project, that\u2019s multi-year project to really shows itself, but we are doing that. I like what is going on in our branding, I like what is going on in our new product capabilities as we rollout coverages and farm and ranch and cyber and directors and officers liability, not for profit in a better way.","I like what we were doing in our service in underwriting, to the very high net worth and being able to underwrite them between admitted in E&S and global in a better way and we can do even better. The game plan we have put in place, if anything we are just crystallizing or focus on it, we are operationalizing better, we have more talent that we brought into high net worth from both inside and outside the organization.","We have restructured, so that we can get a better focus on individual markets and as well speed of how we may change, but at the same time, this is a filed product state-by-state, rating product changes and system changes take time. I love the future ahead of us in that line of business.","Ian Gutterman","Got it, thanks. If I can ask a quick one on commercial, just you sounded a little bit, I don\u2019t know if optimism is the right word, but certainly less pessimistic on where rates are. Is it fair to say though that even if this is a sign of a bottom, we are still trailing loss trend. I\u2019m not trying to ask you for guidance. As I\u2019m looking ahead beyond this year, there is still probably pressure on margins before any improvements that you make from mix or other changes?","Evan Greenberg","Absolutely Ian. Look, I would say this. What we saw in pricing? I don\u2019t if one robin and makes a spring. So I can\u2019t tell, number one. Number two, but look, I recognize it for what it is and its better than we have seen on our book in a number of quarters, number one. Number two, it was on our book of business. And the business were not writing new or that we are losing. I said it in the commentary, I\u2019m going to underline, we are not losing for a couple of points. So it is a hungry market out there.","When we look at terms and conditions, we lose for terms and conditions that we find, it will go across the board that make us shake our heads that are just final irresponsible or dumb. And so we see the market continuing. On the other hand, we do even see in the market generally pricing in a number of classes bottoming. But it\u2019s at a level that absolutely will not earn and underwriting profit.","Ian Gutterman","Completely understood. Thank you for the comments.","Operator","We will go next to Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. With exposure assuming to be improving broadly. How do you think we should think about the portion of exposure increases in your book of business that acts like rates versus that which is actual exposure or increases? I\u2019m just trying to think about the impact\u2026","Evan Greenberg","I know what you think. But Paul, I\u2019m curious, where do you see exposure improving?","Paul Newsome","Well, maybe it\u2019s my hope that the economy improve in the U.S.","Evan Greenberg","Okay. but be careful, don\u2019t witch cast here, because I\u2019m not sure you are seeing it. I don\u2019t see exposure growth improving. I see it flat and in some cases down actually than what we saw say a year ago. I think the economy is solid, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exciting, just kind of taking a long.","The way to think about that is, there is an element and it varies by line of business. Exposure growth for instance in personal lines, a portion of the exposure growth just subsidize rate and a portion of the exposure growth is truly just a one-for-one trade-off.","In commercial lines, it\u2019s a mix also. To be able to tease that out to you and give you a rule of thumb or point estimate, I can\u2019t do it, but you are correct about the elements.","Paul Newsome","Fair enough. Thank you.","Evan Greenberg","I realize it\u2019s not a satisfactory mathematical answer to you, but you are not on to the wrong.","Paul Newsome","I can only ask.","Evan Greenberg","Of course you can. And I can only try to answer.","Paul Newsome","Thanks. That was it.","Operator","We will go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith","Hey, thanks. Two quick questions here. First one, I\u2019m just curious, was there any favorable or unfavorable impact from currency on operating earnings this quarter? And what do you think it\u2019s going to look like here going forward given some of the weakness of the dollar?","Philip Bancroft","It was minimal, it was about $4 million on operating earnings.","Brian Meredith","Okay. And if we look at where we are today, is it benefit?","Philip Bancroft","I don\u2019t think there could be any substantial benefit. Let\u2019s see what happens.","Evan Greenberg","You know it depends, tell us the currency, give us the basket and we will have a better idea, but it\u2019s bouncing around.","Brian Meredith","Got you. And then second question, I\u2019m just curious we are hearing more and more talk about distribution changes going on in the U.S. around the small commercial side and people planning for it. When you look at the small commercial business and your entry into it, are you planning on or your thoughts on direct distribution capability?","Evan Greenberg","Change is coming. I listen to a lot of loud talk these days, that I tried to say in my commentary, we are doing an awful lot, but we are going about it quite right. I think this helps better speak than a lot loud chatter. And I do think some of the talk is ahead of the reality at the moment.","But with that said, change is coming. And we are not alone as in terms of carriers improving their capabilities, because of what technology brings that will lead that change. It\u2019s around data, it\u2019s around straight through process, it\u2019s around data that improves the customer experience, while at the same time improving your ability to select risk and to do it quickly i.e. in seconds and to be able to then straight through process business.","It\u2019s claims on the other end, almost certain co-boarded claims that can be settled the same way. These capabilities will improve the intermediary ability to sell and service the business at a lower cost, to take that cost out it will speed the process.","But at the same time those same capabilities will be delivered through new clients at the intermediary, dot-com type intermediaries, where potential customers are buying other services and products and its natural that it at that time they consider insurance, you are licensing your business your small business, you are setting up the accounting and financing of your small business.","It\u2019s a time that you will consider insurance as an example, there will be many like that. You taking out a loan for your business and technology enables those other forms of distribution. The customer will buy it from a desktop, the customer will buy it from a mobile device, they will buy it any time anywhere and they will service it anytime anywhere.","This is not futuristic in the sense of measuring it in years from now. It\u2019s on our door step, this is the next two years or shorter, it will be iterative, it will only get better and better and better. There won\u2019t be one winner, there will be a number of them.","Brian Meredith","Okay, so you see aggregate is continuing to kind of gain share here at least have success in the U.S.","Evan Greenberg","Define aggregator to me.","Brian Meredith","I mean something like a continuous dot-com in the UK and the personal line side perhaps something here in the U.S. just seems like it hasn\u2019t really caught traction here in the U.S.","Evan Greenberg","Well you know maybe I can see single source distribution with other financial services, I can see those who offer multiple choice, for those who simply want to shop insurance. I\u2019m agnostic, I don\u2019t see any one of them as winners, I see multiple winners, because I don\u2019t think there is one kind of consumer out there, one kind of buying behavior out there and I think there are going to be other compelling options who are you to use in terms of buying that you haven\u2019t had as a choice now to-date. That\u2019s what I say.","Brian Meredith","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen","Thank you. I just want to get an update on the life insurance business, it looks like both the earnings contribution and revenue growth is slowing there, and I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about what is happening?","Philip Bancroft","Yes, the VA business are run-off, variable annuity business. We told you earlier I think it was in the fourth quarter that we adjusted our models and took our earnings and as a result put up our reserve that took down our earnings year-on-year. So quarter-on-quarter was around about $15 million to $16 million a quarter just coming off because of that change, right. And then our international life business is actually growing.","You know Jay what I would do is if you look at Page 18 of this supplement, you will see that while the GAAP premium is down 3% , 3.5% the overall production in the quarter is up 8% if you include deposits and it\u2019s up 14% over the six months. So we are starting to see strong growth in the production for the overall international life book.","Evan Greenberg","We would look at production more than GAAP premium.","Jay Cohen","Got it. Helpful. Thank you.","Evan Greenberg","This is a kind of FAS product that\u2019s being sold.","Operator","Our last question comes from Meyer Shields, KBW.","Meyer Shields","Thanks very much for squeezing me in. Evan, can you compare the list of business within reinsurance now to two or three years ago. Is that changing?","Evan Greenberg","Say that again Meyer.","Meyer Shields","I\u2019m wondering whether, obviously the premium volumes in global reinsurance are coming down. So it\u2019s the mix opposite?","Evan Greenberg","Well. I\u2019m just trying to add it up before I give you a complete answer, because everything has been coming down. Casualty is down, risk property is down, cat has been down. The mix is probably pretty steady, maybe it\u2019s biases a little more towards the risk lines than the cat lines.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then finally, can you just get a quick explanation of what will be adverse development in the corporate segment?","Evan Greenberg","It\u2019s the run-off business, the Brandywine run-off business is in the corporate segment.","Philip Bancroft","Right. So it was the business that was put into Brandywine in about 1995, there is a number of casualty lines where we had development.","Evan Greenberg","We don\u2019t have a run-off division, that we sort of put things we don\u2019t like. This is the Brandywine run-off. And also Chubb had as well run-off A&E. And we study the loan, what we call LTE other than, it\u2019s other than asbestoses environmental which are third and fourth quarter. This is the other lines that would be like sexual molestation, et cetera, and it\u2019s a run-off of that and that\u2019s where charge was taken.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Thanks very much.","Evan Greenberg","You are welcome.","Helen Wilson","All right. Thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking you to you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day."],"5101":["Chubb Ltd.

Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the conference over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Helen Wilson","Thank you. And welcome to our December 31, 2016 fourth quarter year-end earnings conference call.","Our report will contain forward-looking statements, including statements related to company performance, investment income expectations, pricing and business mix, economic and insurance market conditions and integration of our acquisition of the Chubb Corporation and potential synergies and benefits we may realize.","All of these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actually, results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent SEC filings as well as our earnings press release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.","We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in our earnings release and financial supplement, which are available at investors.chubb.com.","Now I would like to introduce your speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we will take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.","Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.","Evan Greenberg","Good morning. Chubb had a very good quarter that contributed to an excellent year, in both financial and non-financial results. We set big agenda for ourselves and accomplished most all of what we set out to achieve.","Financially, we produced record annual operating earnings per share, world-class combined ratios, strong book and tangible book value growth and a good operating ROE. We accomplished these results despite elevated catastrophe losses and soft P&C market conditions globally.","Operationally, we completed the largest merger in insurance history and managed a transformational companywide global integration effort all while staying focused on our core business of underwriting and servicing customers and distribution partners, retaining our commercial and personal lines customers at or above all time high.","We launch new products, and entirely new businesses, made investments in our people, technologies and capabilities, began to harness the complementary strengths of the organization, cross selling and other revenue initiatives. We achieved or exceeded substantially all of the financial and non-financial targets we established when we initiated the merger.","After-tax operating income for the quarter was 1.3 billion or 2.72 per share, compared to 2.38 per share up over 14%. For the year, net operating income was over 4.7 billion or $10.12 per share, up about 3.5% and illustrating the accretive nature of the merger.","Earnings in the quarter included one-time 113 million pre-tax benefit related to the harmonization of our U.S. retirement programs. Phil will have more to say about the retirement program changes and both one-time and ongoing income benefits they will produce.","As a reminder, when discussing our underwriting results and premium growth, I will compare our results to the 15 year as if we were one company back then and excluding the effects of purchase accounting from the 16 year underwriting results. That is how I look at it and I think that gives you the clearest view of operations.","Our combined ratios for the quarter and year were simply excellent. Beginning with the quarter, the P&C combined ratio was 87.6%. That compares to an 87.3% last year as if we were one company back then.","Included in that combined ratio were about 100 million more of Cat losses and slightly less positive prior period reserve development than prior year. Therefore, the P&C current accident year combined ratio excluding Cat losses was outstanding at 87.1% versus 88.6% prior year.","Driven by both our core global P&C business, which produced very good results and our crop insurance business, which had a simply outstanding quarter due to a very strong crop underwriting year.","Crop insurance underwriting income in the quarter was up 128 million over prior year quarter. The current accident year also benefited from reduce expense ratio about half a point.","For the year, powered by 3.2 billion underwriting income, the combine ratio was 88%, compared to 87.5% last year and that\u2019s with about 211 million more in Cat losses and pretty flat year-on-year prior period reserve development, which again speaks to the quality and underlying strength of our underwriting product portfolio construction.","Net investment income for the quarter was 845 million, which was above the top of the guidance we gave you last quarter. For the year, net investment income was 3.3 billion about equal to underwriting income and an excellent result given the interest rate environment, which was at historic lows for most of the year until the sudden rise following the election.","In the quarter, I was encourage by what I hope is the beginning of the shift towards a greater fiscal related stimulus policy in the U.S. including tax reform, reduced business regulation and increased infrastructure investment in place of an over-reliance on monitory policy, which in my judgment has more than run its course.","However, given continued overreliance on cheap money and excessive liquidity in Europe and Japan in particular coupled with lack luster global economic growth, the world is not coordinated. And one impact of that is a stronger dollar.","Chubb's strong earnings lead to a very good operating ROE of 11% for the quarter and 10.5% for the year. Keep in mind, every 100 basis points of investment portfolio yield for Chubb is equal to approximately 175 basis points of ROE.","Book and tangible book value growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by the sharp rise in interest rates and to a lesser extent the dollar. There were a number of offsetting positive items that all together met net book and tangible book were relatively flat a very good result.","For the year, book value per share increased about 15.5% and tangible book value per share decreased 16% both as a result of the merger. However, it is worth noting that from the merger closing on January 14 to year-end, book value per share increased 7.5% and tangible book value per share increased over 13%.","We are ahead of where we expected to be in both per share and tangible book value growth with the later now down 16% versus an initial 29% at the time of the merger closing and on-track to hit pre-transaction levels in three and a quarter years.","For those who like to micro analyze, it was three and quarter when we announced the merger in July of 2015 and we lost three months due to the dramatic rise in interest rates in the fourth quarter and its mark-to-market impact on book value. However, by the end of the quarter and now we are back to where we started.","Phil will have more to say about investment income, change to VA portfolio, tangible book value prior period reserve development and Cat. For the quarter, premium revenue was in-line with what we experienced during the year. In fact, a little bit better.","The same themes prevail, strong retentions of business, less new business due to market conditions, modestly more new business due to cross-selling and the strength of the organization and a revenue penalty due in large part to merger related underwriting actions including the purchase of additional reinsurance. The impact from this last item will ameliorate as we move through 2017.","For the year, P&C net premiums and global P&C net premiums, which exclude agriculture were both down 1% in constant dollars, excluding merger related underwriting actions. For the quarter, P&C net premiums on the same basis were essentially flat while global P&C net premiums were up over 1%.","The commercial P&C insurance market globally is soft and conditions vary depending on the territory, line of business and size of risk. Rates are generally flat or declining depending on class of business, size of customer and territory.","Terms of conditions have been softening a bit in a number of classes. On the other hand, there are a few stress classes here and there where we are achieving rates.","As noted in prior quarters, large account business particularly shared and layered is more competitive than midsize. Though middle market is becoming more competitive, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. As companies stress about growth and reach more aggressively.","Wholesale is again more competitive than retail. Certain markets are notably more competitive than others. London, Bermuda, Australia and Brazil by example are particularly competitive, while in the U.S. and Continental Europe competition is a little less ferocious and a bit more orderly, but softening nonetheless.","Claims inflation has been lower than historical averages in recent years, but hardly non-existed. And as pricing hasn\u2019t kept pace, industry combined ratios are coming under pressure. At the same time, as you have noticed loss cost inflation has increased in certain classes professional lines and automobile in the U.S. come to mind.","As I mentioned earlier, natural catastrophe losses were up last year, it was the sixth costliest year on record for Cat, but not enough the impact the oversupply of industry capital. The industry capital base continues to expand from a combination of retained earnings and new investors.","So globally, new business remains harder to come by. It is a hungry market and competition is fierce for new business. On the other hand, speaking for our company, our total capabilities in terms of product, ability to serve different insurance customers, our deep distribution strength and extensive geographic reach means our optionality or ability to capitalize on opportunity is simply outstanding and we are just getting started.","Rate movement for the business we wrote in the quarter varied by territory and market segments. Renewal pricing overall range from flat and our U.S. middle market business to down 2% in both our U.S. major accounts and international retail commercial P&C businesses.","In North America, retail general and specialty casualty-related pricing range from flat to down 1.5%. Financial lines pricing range from flat to down 2% and property related pricing range from down 1.5% to down 5%.","Internationally, general and specialty casualty-related pricing range from up 3% to down 3%. Financial lines pricing range from flat to down 3% and property related pricing range from down 1% to down 5%.","Now, with that as context, let me give you some detail on our revenue results for the quarter. In our North America commercial P&C business, net premiums were down about 5%.","Normalizing for the impact of the additional reinsurance, we purchased and for the underwriting actions we took, net premiums were down 2.5%.","The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was quite good at over 89% with middle market at 88% and major accounts at 92%. Overall, new business writings for North America commercial lines were down about 8%.","In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were down almost 5%. The additional reinsurance we purchased had a 6.5 point impact, and the Fireman\u2019s Fund had about a 0.5 point impact.","Therefore, growth was 2.2% for the combined Chubb and ACE portfolios. Rates were up two exposure changes added about 3.5. Retention remained quite strong for the Chubb and ACE portfolios at about 95%.","Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were up five in the quarter in constant dollar and up over 7.5 when normalized through the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions.","However, it is worth noting that we benefited in our international business from a $48 million one-time premium increase that will not repeat.","Growth in international was lead by Latin America with net premiums up over 10, followed by the continent of Europe, Asia and the UK with growth of 7.5, 6.5 and 2.5 respectively. In our London market, based CNS business premiums were flat.","As I said earlier, our agriculture business had a great year, highlighted by a combined ratio of about 74%. This is a Cat like business and therefore it has certain volatility to it by its nature. Its weather exposed, with weather impacting crop yields and commodity prices.","We have experienced both sides of volatility, years with great growing seasons and others with drought. This has been and continues to be a good business for Chubb.","In sum, while market conditions globally are competitive I expect as we progress through 2017 and the impact of the merger continues to fade and the compelling power and capabilities of the organization gain more momentum matched against the long list of opportunities in front of us, we will produce faster growth.","John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter including current market conditions and pricing trends.","I want to say a few words about integration. Among the noteworthy accomplishments of last year, was the integration of two large companies realizing substantial efficiencies while remaining outward facing and managing and growing our business in all aspects.","While more work remains, a substantial portion of the heavy lifting is moving behind us and we'll continue as 2017 progresses. From underwriting to claims, to real-estate and IT, to finance and HR, our operational integration has been detailed and all encompassing and we are ahead of schedule in all areas.","As for cultural integration, there is a strong sense of unity in placing growing in the company. Through shared experience small and large, they are knitting ourselves together and breeding familiarity. And that in time creates trust, loyalty, friendship and a one team spirit.","We don't overly talk about and contemplate our culture, except to the extent we all need to be on the same page with clarity and comfort. Instead, we prefer to simply live our culture.","In terms of financial measures while early days at the end of one year we are on-track or ahead of the objectives underpinning the merger. These include expense savings, operating EPS, ROE and as I noted earlier per share book and tangible book value.","Where we said the merger would be immediately accretive to earnings and book value per share, we are ahead of our own internal projections. As well as what we would likely have been on our plans as a standalone ACE Limited company.","Broadly speaking, we are in a time of uncertainty, economically and geopolitically. On the one hand, the world is a tense place, marked by growing nationalism and populism that are feeding protection as sentiment. This is a global phenomenon.","I might add, while early days I am concerned about our own country\u2019s potential trade and security posture. On the other hand, in the U.S., the monetary and fiscal changes afoot around tax, regulation of business, infrastructure and higher interest rates are real positive for business, jobs and the economy if implemented in a way that doesn\u2019t exacerbate budget deficits.","Finally, we are a country of immigrants; our country\u2019s openness to immigration is fundamental to our identity and history as a nation and vital to our future prosperity. I am 100% for the security of citizens, but at the same time America is the land of the free and we are beacon in place of refuge that those seeking a better and safer life to themselves and their families. Shutting our doors to immigration is a mistake.","Despite or challenging environment, Chubb is a company built to outperform, I have never been more confident in our people and capabilities and I am optimistic and simply energized when I think about our company\u2019s future both 2017 and beyond.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil, and then I\u2019ll be back to take your questions.","Philip Bancroft","Thanks Evan. We have come to our first year of the merger with excellent and stable ratings, a strong balance sheet and substantial of capital generating capabilities. Our operating cash flow was 1.5 billion for the quarter and 5.3 billion for the year.","In the quarter, investment income was 845 million, which was higher than our previously expected range of 820 million to 830 million, 8 million was due to a one-time positive merger related adjustments.","We also had increased call activity on our corporate bond portfolio and we are benefiting from the changes we have made to the management of our portfolio.","Where there are always a number of factors that impact the variability and investment income, we are raising our expectation for our quarterly investment income run rate to range of 830 million to 840 million.","Net realized and unrealized losses after tax for the quarter were 1 billion comprising a 1.3 billion loss from our investment portfolio, primarily from rising interest rates and a foreign currency loss of 300 million.","These were partially offset by 275 million gains from our VA reinsurance portfolio also from rising interest rates and 350 million favorable adjusted related to our retiree plans.","Net loss reserves decrease 687 million for the quarter on a constant dollar basis. This reflects the favorable impact of the agriculture book of 339 million.","Favorable PPD of 238 million and 60 million of amortization of the fair value liability adjustment established in purchase accounting.","On an \u201cAs If\u201d and constant dollar basis, net loss reserves increased 1.2 billion for the year adjusted for the items discussed above.","The paid-to-incurred ratio was 99% for the quarter and 92% for the year both also adjusted for items discussed above. We had positive prior period development of $238 million pre-tax or $208 million after tax with 56% from short-tail lines and 44% from 44% from long-tail lines principally from accident years 2010 and prior.","This included $78 million pre-tax of adverse development for legacy asbestoses exposures, which are now included in corporate.","Our catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter net of reinsurance were $268 million pre-tax or $222 million after tax. Ag losses included a $190 million from Hurricane Matthew and $60 million from the New Zealand earthquake.","During the fourth quarter of 2016, the company harmonized and amended several U.S. retirement programs to create a unified retirement savings program.","In 2020, the company will transition a traditional defined benefit pension program that had been in effect for certain employees to define contribution program.","Additionally, after 2025 the company plans to eliminate a subsidized U.S. retiree healthcare plan that had been in place for certain employees.","The U.S. pension and retiree healthcare plan changes favorably impacted book value by $322 million reflecting a more favorable - decrease in benefit obligations.","Net income and operating income were favorably impacted by the one-time $113 million pre-tax benefit related to the harmonization of the U.S. pension plans. This item is excluded from the P&C combined ratio.","On an annualized basis, the company expects to continue to recognize a benefit of $100 million pre-tax or $65 million after tax each year for the next five years relating to the harmonization after which the benefit continues in a range of $50 million to $80 million pre-tax depending on interest rates at the time.","Life underwriting income includes the unfavorable impact of an adjustment made to the long-term benefit ratio used in determining operating income associated with the company's variable annuity reinsurance business.","During the quarter, the company determined that certain assumptions, primarily long-term interest rates, underlying the long-term benefit ratio should be updated.","This adjusted resulted in a pre-tax and after tax operating charge of $17 million. Since we carry the overall GMIB reserves at fair value, this adjustment represents a shift between operating income and realized gains and does not impact book value.","The company expects a similar incremental impact to underwriting income and realized gains in future quarters, which will total an approximate $60 million reduction in operating income and a corresponding realized gain in 2017.","During the quarter, premium growth was negatively impacted by merger related underwriting actions including additional reinsurance of $206 million bringing the total for the year to $650 million and impacting growth by 2.3%.","Our integration efforts are either on-track or ahead of schedule as Evan said. Total integration related savings realized in the quarter and for the year were 123 million and 325 million respectively. Annual run rate savings of 800 million by the end of 2018 are on-track.","Total revenue synergies produced in the quarter and for the year were 83 million and 297 million respectively. For some additional color, revenue synergies for the quarter related to our North America retail P&C business represented 14% of our new business.","I\u2019ll turn the call back to Helen.","Helen Wilson","Thank you. At this point, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Ryan Tunis, Credit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis","Hey thanks, good morning. My first question just on the pension. Is the 100 million that you expecting to recognize over the next five years or so additive to the $800 million expense save guide you have given in the past?","Philip Bancroft","Yes, it is. The $800 does not include the incremental benefit from the past.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. Understood. And then I guess just going back to Evan\u2019s discussion about the positive impact on ROE from higher interest rates. And just thinking about how to balance, how to think about balancing underwriting returns, ROE and growth, I guess due this next cycle. If you have got higher interest rate, lower tax rates, arguably more competition. I mean should we be more focused ROE is the metrics are pricing around or should we continue to be thinking about kind of underlying combined ratios that are sub-90? Thanks.","Evan Greenberg","I think, with the exception of your final comment, I think you should be focused on underwriting combined ratio. And we look at underwriting independent of investment income. We underwrite around here to an acceptable combined ratio.","And yes, we do look at senior most levels in terms of capital management; we do look at how much capital each business draws and at certain combined ratio hurdles, what kind of ROE we\u2019ll produce. And that sort of sets to a degree targets that we establish for our businesses that combined ratios we don\u2019t want exceeding. If that helps you.","Ryan Tunis","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Operator","Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. I was hoping first to get some, in terms of the potential for corporate tax reform in the U.S.I know Chubb is in a little bit of a different position given your split domicile. But how do you just high level see tax reform impacting Chubb and when you think about the potential for tax reform, do you think it gets competed away, meaning if a company is operating at a higher tax rate, they can potential push for lower prices as they manage their book to a certain ROE?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. I\u2019m going to answer your first part first. Anybody who runs a decent business, they don\u2019t run their business based on tax. Tax does not drive how you make your fundamental decisions and how you operate a business.","I have worked in more than one company and I have never, that kind of conversation is never entered into how we think about our business. So we think about underwriters, underwriting which is what we do for living and combined ratios, there is hardly does tax ever enter the discussion.","As to the first part of your question for our U.S. sourced business, look our U.S. business represents over 60% of our company's business. And our U.S. sourced business has the tax rate in the 20%. Tax reform is important to us and it's important to our country.","And as the U.S. economy would improve at my judge over tax reform that would benefit the insurance industry, because that would mean faster economic growth and faster economic growth means more exposure, more exposure means faster growth for insurance. So I am in favor of tax reform.","Right now, they are discussing, as you know it's a long way before we have tax reform and we are at very early stages. What Republic and Congress has put on the table so far revolves around border adjustment.","How border adjustment will be interpreted for financial services is not yet clear. And in fact to those who are writing tax policy who we are very engaged with it is not clear to them.","When it comes to insurance, the question on the table right now revolves around two, reserves, how reserves will be treated, number two in particular, how reinsurance will be treated. In my judgment border adjustment tax, reinsurance is clearly an export of risk.","You're exporting risk and you don't know the profit and loss so that risk ahs ultimately been earned through. It is hardly an importing of capital.","So I would expect that would be treated in a reasonable way in tax policy and that would be the advantage of the U.S. We are taking the advantage of the world balance sheet where insurance has benefited corporate America and consumer America just greatly over the years.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay thank you. Last quarter on your call, you alluded to some initiatives on the small commercial side. Can you just talk to the receptivity from agents in that business? I know it's still early days, but any kind of takeaways from kind of the fourth quarter and into 2017?","Evan Greenberg","It's very early days. And we'll talk about it a little bit. But I'm measuring this so that at least we stay on would be swear on perspective. I'm measuring this over years given the nature of it. These are relatively small policies and it takes a long time to build something. Paul Krump love to tell the stories. I know he is from the Mid West and I'm going to turn it over to him for a moment.","Paul Krump","Well thank you Evan. Elyse thanks for the question. Small commercial I think we very much on-track but again as Evan said I can't overemphasize.","But this is what building this over years, but to your direct question, the receptivity by the agents and brokers has been outstanding.","First of all, they love the platter of products that we are bringing into bear. They know and they have seen what we are building for the CSR\u2019s so that it\u2019s easy to do business with us.","There are some really strong competitors in this space, but this is a very fragmented marketplace and we are beginning welcomed and it\u2019s just going to take some time to continue to build it.","Elyse Greenspan","Thank you. And just one last question if I may. As you alluded to Evan in your comments about the prospects for higher inflation. As the industry deals with inflation, I think its some people start to think about potential reserve picks to be tested on some of the longer tail lines. Now that the company has been merged for about, a year and you have gone through both the legacy company reserves. Can we just get high level of view about the condition that you have in the fixed and some of your longer tail lines, as we think about potential inflationary trends picking up from here?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. It\u2019s very simple. The last number of years, most recent past inflation has been benign, lost cost inflation has been benign. But both companies have continued to use historic trend factors and we have done that right through our current year in our casualty related lines that\u2019s what matters. And so with that, I think we are comfortable if we return to a higher loss trend.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski, BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Sebaski","Good morning. The first question is on the North America retail, I think Phil mentioned 14% of the new business synergies are from that. Just hoping to get a little bit more clarity on where the synergies are coming from and if that includes the A&H within that synergy line or how you are thinking about that?","Evan Greenberg","Sure it does. Let\u2019s see. Who would like to take this? John.","John Lupica","Sure. I\u2019ll take a crack. So thank you for the question Charles. In terms of that cross-sell coming from all forms of synergies mainly in our specialty lines. The great hallmark of Chubb was in the phenomenal distribution and the agency network, ACE brings a lot of specialty products.","So we have been spending the better part of the year making sure that product breadth is getting introduced into that agency of course and into our core customer base. So specialties like environmental, like A&H that we are selling, builders risks, all through the industry verticals, it is driving that cross-sell.","In addition, the strength of the organization where we are bringing our core product to a new distribution of course we are measuring that as well. So between growth initiatives, specialties, strength of the organization, we really do see the power of the group coming together.","Charles Sebaski","Okay. I guess on a broader base on product line. Evan, a lot of the rate commentary you gave seem to be that a lot of lines are reasonably managed in a couple of points plus or minus. Are there any lines that give you pause, I have seen some stuff recently that there has been some pullouts of political risk. Is there areas where things are just, maybe needing to take a step back or the market is not where you think it should be rational, reasonable?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. Charles sure. There is not lines of business where we need to step back, because we see trouble underwriting. We will see that. We are really on top of it and vigilant about that. We always look for early signs.","Obviously, with the merger, there are businesses that weren't meeting our standards that we have cancelled and - some we cancelled put them in run-off and I have spoken about that.","Beyond that, I think the message is pretty simple. We don't like a lot of the market pricing for new business. And so we are willing to take the new business penalty. The numbers I gave you were the numbers - the rates and the rate movement was for our renewal portfolio.","And we measure relativity of the new business pricing against our renewal rates. And our new business pricing is very similar to our renewal pricing. But to be able to achieve that we have to be willing to write less business, we are seeing more submissions.","The first quarter our submission activity was up substantially, but the amount that we will right is down and that reflects the competitive market conditions where we are just simply not going to dumb stuff for growth.","Charles Sebaski","Okay. And as just finally, I think at the very beginning Evan you made a comment that you said you have accomplished most of the things that you wanted to with the merger and integration of Chubb. Curious on what may not have gotten to par.","Evan Greenberg","I didn't want to use the word everything, so I thought that would just sound a little arrogant. And we always are vein hopeful about things. When I step back I got it tell you and really look at it. It's always a little crap on the margin, but we have accomplished what we set out to achieve in the year.","Our revenue growth was a little less than I wanted it to be, but when look at it, sure in the early part of the year there was market distracts - there was internal distractions emerging, but we expected that.","It was the market itself I think just given the nature of competition, we didn't write as much new as I would like to have written. But okay, that's it. Don't worry about it.","Charles Sebaski","Thank you very much for the answers.","Evan Greenberg","And we lost a handful of people, we wish we hadn't lost. But we planned; we knew we were going to lose people we didn't want to lose. We lost far fewer of those, but still each of them breaks your heart.","Charles Sebaski","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from [indiscernible] Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. With regard to the comment that growth should improve looking ahead. Does that mean we should expect positive growth in North America commercial and personal lines?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. For 2017 in total, I expect that that\u2019s what we are going to see that\u2019s our objective. And remember there is going to be - so I just give you a little more color. The re-underwriting, the underwriting actions we took due to the merger break into two pieces, business that we cancel and that runoff will have an impact through the year. So that impact will diminish.","The additional reinsurance we purchased that will have an impact fundamentally in the first half of the year and should be about gone by the end of the mid-year. And then, we have underlying actions that we already see the power building in our core business or core middle market in our A&H business, specialty casualty areas.","I expect in our large account business more of a slight to safety and quality, which we are seeing in our risk management and our multinational business. I expect our industry verticals and the power of that to produce the better result or high net-worth business.","The two legacy companies together with the core portfolio will do better. And I expect specialty, personalized, internationally and small middle market around the world to contribute. And A&H I said that I mean that globally.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Evan you just mentioned [FICO] (Ph) safety and quality, there has been a number of large global property casualty insurers facing ongoing turmoil. Can you update us your thoughts in terms of what that means for Chubb?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. Chubb is a steady as she goes going from strength-to-strength. Our product offering has never been broader and beyond that our ability to coordinate all of the skills of the organization and bring it to bear for a customers, honest to god it\u2019s never been more compelling.","The technology that we have to service the large account business and bring total solution, but manage it through the customer. We are really distinguishing ourselves, our service and our service reputation in both underwriting and claims is a breath of fresh air for most who have experienced some of those companies that are having issues.","We have been very predictive going steady for our customers and for those who might be interested in trying us out. That\u2019s what they want.","They want predictability and steadiness of both breadth of product offerings, because we offer as broad or broader product offering than any other competitor to our customers from risk management to access casualty to professional lines, to environmental, to their international needs around the world.","And very few can do that and we do it in a very steady predictable way, we are not changing year-to-year in our appetite or in how we approach the underwriting of that business.","That has just caused us to gain more customers, we continue to first of January was very good for us that way. We are gaining more customers; we are gaining more who are taking a look at us.","Particularly as they are more uncomfortable with where they have been. And it's easy to see why they were uncomfortable. Some of those companies appeared to be wrong.","Unidentified Analyst","Interesting. And my final question is on asbestos trends, a number of other large companies with legacy asbestos exposures have had to raise the reserve estimates this year. Chubb didn't, I believe, can you discuss that?","Evan Greenberg","No, no, we have raised our reserve estimates; we did take a charge this quarter. The net amount was about $87 million I believe. $78 million. And that was a net of both branding wide taking a bit higher charge and we put the federal reserves on a life basis. And they had some favorable development. The two of them together produce the 78 million.","But we are not seeing importantly a change in trends in asbestos. It was very case specific for us. The one place where we have seen a bit of an increase in cost is in defensive cases. We are defending cases rigorously and the cost of the defending those has been more inflated.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you for the answers.","Evan Greenberg","And we recognize that in our reserves.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi good morning. Talk about inflation picking up in an earlier question. But there is a difference between general U.S. inflation and insurance claims inflation. I was wondering if you just talk about your outlook for the factors that drive claims inflation under the new administration and Congress. And if you could also just elaborate on your comment at professional lines claims inflation was picking up.","Evan Greenberg","Yes, professional lines claims inflation is an obvious that everybody can see who book into business its public information. I will come back to it. Look, Congress and the new administration all speculation. I have no idea and you have no idea.","Its one thing they have in agenda, but what are you actually going to pass and how long is it going to take to accomplish. And then what will be its impact ultimately well that's pretty far down the road. So we don't speculate and in our lost text, we don't speculate.","Insurance inflation is about parts and labor. It's about legal cost, medical expense and that is up to what we called social inflation. And those cost inputs are different than general inflation as I'm sure you know.","When it comes to professional lines, there have been more security class action suites, there were number of sources of that. And in particular, and we have noticed that in claims reporting and development.","How many of those notices turned on to actual claims and what are the size of those claims. The severity has been fairly constant. It\u2019s been an increase in frequency this year. And we are vigilant about that.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then secondly, if interest rates go up, do you think that benefit get competed away by the market?","Evan Greenberg","You know to a degree. You have always seen that. There are companies who cash flow underwrite and underwrite to total return, they usually are great underwriting companies, I have never noticed that they are. And then good companies remain more disciplined about that and don\u2019t compete it away. So, it\u2019s a chaotic world. You will see all varieties.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay. Thank you.","Evan Greenberg","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. First question Evan you mentioned about the given pricing pressure, the industry combined ratio is under pressure. So if you look at Chubb, actually you are underlying combined ratio has remained largely stable. I was just wondering, can you see your underwriting actions or the more realized expense savings from the merger could overcome the pricing pressure to maintain or improve the margin in the coming years?","Evan Greenberg","What I see is that it will ameliorate a rise in combined ratio. Expense ratio will ameliorate a rise in loss ratio, the merger expense benefits. The underwriting actions we taken and portfolio management and mix of business will also ameliorate loss ratio.","But does it eliminate it? No. And overtime, I expect naturally if the market remains as it is and I think the market you see is the market you get. I think it various by line of business et cetera, the dynamics but in total, I expect that it rises.","We have certain lines of business like agriculture, like high net-worth, like A&H that really aren\u2019t subject to that at all. You have other businesses like middle market commercial and traditional business that is less impacted by that.","So the mix of the portfolio and how we have selected our portfolio and constructed it and the geographies in which we conduct different businesses have a way of ameliorating.","But each individual line by itself has this pressure of loss ratio in a market where rate is flat or down and trend continues. And of course, we are of the market. What I am confident about is that we will continue to distinguish ourselves and outperform.","Kai Pan","Okay. Thank you. And my second question is on the capital management, the Board recently authorized $1 billion programs through 2017. I just wondered when they discussed at this topic, how do you allocate that the size of the buyback relative to your $5 billion annual earnings and relative to your dividends, as well as potential growth and acquisition opportunities?","Evan Greenberg","Well, if you know. First of all, look at earnings on an after tax basis and we have dividend policy that we payout roughly 30% we say it took a 30% in dividends. We then look at opportunity both internal growth and potential external opportunities to grow over a period of time and capital flexibility.","And so through that discussion, we determine what a comfortable target is for company need and then what remains is how we determine what to return to shareholders. Then we have a discussion of what is the best for the return to shareholders. Its dividend related, is it one-time dividend or is it share repurchase, and that's how we come to it.","Kai Pan","Okay great. Well thanks so much.","Evan Greenberg","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks so much. Just I want to get a little clarification Evan you were talking about growth and you talked a little bit about reinsurance changes in the 2016 and the fourth quarter. So do your comments imply that you expect growth on a gross basis than just to step out of the whole reinsurance conversation?","Evan Greenberg","Yes, but we also have business and we have been very transparent with you about that. Business portfolios that in the merger when we pull the companies together and went through the business we said there are business portfolios that are not meeting or standards we have talked about some of those and that we cancelled those. Well those when you cancelled them you are eliminating gross as well as net. So you got to keep that in mind.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay got it. And then just quick on the Ag book. So the last couple of years have been below and well below at sort of 80 to 90 range. Just trying to think about that business, and the last couple of years have been both below the range especially the last one 2016 being that. How should we be thinking about whether it's your use of reinsurance in this line or what the profitability should look like, should we get back to that more normal level, or it\u2019s just a good starting point to think about what that business should be able to contribute?","Evan Greenberg","I think you guys have short memory. This year was a very good year. Last year was a good year, but not that far off the normal trend by the way, it was a good year but not that far off. And we look over it 10, 15 and 20 year.","We put the business on level, because there were things that impact loss ratio in the current year that didn't impact 20 years ago, because prices have changed, yields per acre and how seed and fertilizer behaves changed to the positive in that, growing seasons have changed a bit because of weather.","So we actually consider all of that and put on level that come the historic combined ratio. And that historic that you cite of that 89,90 is where we have remain. And that's why we are saying to you, I don't wait for a bad year to say, this I will say it in a good year. It\u2019s a Cat like business and it has a volatility to it and so you measure it over a period of time.","But, I think it\u2019s not excessive, we get a reasonable risk adjusted return on that business and I think we have very clear competitive advantages in our franchise, that just put us light years ahead of, fundamentally, anyone else in that business.","Particularly around our analytics, our deep distribution and spread of business, our knowledge and insight of data and people with experience that go back so many years. And we have a cost advantage and a technology advantage that is very hard barrier to leap.","Michael Nannizzi","Great. Thanks for that. And then maybe if I could sneak in one last one on maybe for Phil on the legacy Chubb municipal bond portfolio. How are you thinking about that? Do you expect to sell that down or just reinvest once those bonds mature? And just Evan, one more clarification, I don\u2019t have a short memory, I have a bad memory, that\u2019s totally.","Philip Bancroft","So if you look at any portfolio, it\u2019s very highly graded at AA, 80% of its graded AA or higher. It earns a pretty attractive book yield, it\u2019s over 3.3% and it\u2019s got a duration of about 4.8 years.","And I guess what we see now, I mean we talk about the changes of interest rates and the impact that may have on our choice to hold that portfolio, we are running scenarios at different tax rates to determine the impact on the portfolio.","The ultimate allocation will depend not only on a tax rate, but also relative value of the municipals to the other possibilities in the portfolio. So we are evaluating it, we will look at it in light of the tax developments that emerged over the next months.","Michael Nannizzi","Thank you so much for the answers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Newsome, Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. I was hoping you could just run me through the accounting through the negative combined ratio in the Ag business, just so that of we know what went on there, because it\u2019s a little strange to have a negative combined ratio for a quarter.","Evan Greenberg","Yes. We are not going to run you through it. But Phil will take, if you want to get more detail, take it offline. But it\u2019s pretty simple. In this business, remember it\u2019s a public private sector sharing program, this is a Federal Government Sponsored Program.","So there is a very clear formula that you follow, because the government takes a certain amount of the risks and both individual risks and excessive loss protections that they provide. And so depending on the actual year and how it comes out, you apply the formula of how you share with the government.","In this quarter, you have to give premium to the government. Therefore, your earned based goes down substantially and that\u2019s how you end up with the negative combined ratio.","They take premium, they take a certain amount of losses and so it\u2019s the denominator that is driving that. You are following me?","Paul Newsome","I am. That\u2019s getting me where I want to go. Thank you.","Evan Greenberg","You got it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen","Thank you. Yes just looking at I guess the U.S. business as North American businesses. You did say in personalize side was that the accident year loss ratio excluding tax did jump up this quarter relative to the past four relative to the past seven. I'm wondering if there is any kind a unusual items in there whether a large loss activity. And then similarly in the commercial business again North America that accident year ratio ex-Cat wasn't quite as bigger jump, but it did go up from where it had been and I am wondering what is happening there as well.","Evan Greenberg","Yes, I'm going to ask Paul Krump to talk about one of them the personal lines. And then I want to make a comments to you. And then I am going to have John Lupica just talk about the commercial lines what happened one-on-one.","Paul Krump","Well thanks for question Jay as Evan said I am a bit of a storyteller. So let me just backup here a second. The 2016 fourth quarter combined ratio for PRS is 82.1 excluding Cats and PPD. That compares to 80.9 in the fourth quarter of 2015, so up a little bit.","However, the fourth quarter of 2015 underwriting income benefited by $18 million from back holiday related to the purchase of prior funds. So if we reduced the 2015 underwriting income by that one-time adjustment, we actually end up with an 82.4 current accident year combined ratio ex-Cat and PPD compared to the 82.1 that we had.","So all up you actually saw on a combined ratio basis is 0.3 point improvement in the current accident year's combined ratio obviously mainly due to the expense ratio is often to the synergies and impacting the new reinsurance agreement that Evan just touched on numerous response.","So the lost ratio was up a little bit. And as you said it was due to some losses and they were the non-Cat weather area, in particular we saw some more water damage claims and some burst pipes.","But as Evan also said in his earlier comments that's a bit of noise. The reinsurance business goes up or down a little bit quarter-by-quarter.","Jay Cohen","Yeah that's helpful Paul.","Evan Greenberg","And John, actually the opposite.","John Lupica","Yes Jay and thanks. On the commercial side, for both Paul and I are all in North America that the year-over-year change is really just the fact that our 2015 current accident year have a fewer amount and lower large losses than we saw in 2016.","I wouldn't say 2016 was above average I would just say 2015 was probably below average and that's really the change.","Evan Greenberg","Yes and it make sense to you Jay?","Jay Cohen","Yes. Thank you.","Evan Greenberg","And I just want to - I have read a number of that analysts early reports and talking about this questions. And I don't want to make comment about that.","We had simply an outstanding quarter, our calendar year combined ratio reflects all the good and all the bad. i.e. there were more Cats, there was flat PPD. We had outstanding crop we had excellent global P&C results.","Looking at the business as sort of well but for this, well but for that, except for one-time items like the pension benefit, which is fair is misleading in my mind, because all these businesses are ongoing businesses and it makes contribution.","We are in the risk business, and there you are going to see noise always from one quarter to another quarter.","We didn\u2019t reach in our current accident year reserving, whatsoever, and how we post loss ratios, we didn\u2019t suddenly grow optimistic and I remind you that we are conservative in how we manage our business.","We recognize bad quickly and we are very slow to recognize good. So as you look at the individual pieces, I wanted to give you a bigger perspective on it.","Jay Cohen","Got it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman, Balyasny.","Ian Gutterman","Hi. Thank you. First, a quick numbers one and then a question reserves. So could you just clarify that the 60 million in VA. Is that just for 2017 or is that sort of recurring thing well into the future?","Philip Bancroft","It will go into the future. I mean, unless we change our view of interest rates or change other assumptions. But based on what we feel now that would be a continuing adjustment.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. Thank you. And Evan just to flush out a little bit more sort of what is going on in the industry and where things maybe heading on reserves and so forth. I was hoping we could flush out a little bit more I think you alluded earlier.","But, specifically the topic of adverse development coverage, whether they be just people buying a little bit of protection for align that they are a little nervous about to some of these gigantic unprecedented deals.","It seems ADCs are back and away we haven\u2019t seen an almost 20 years now. And last time when they were prevalent, it seems to be a pretty good tale, right? I mean the buyers where the smart ones and the sellers where the dumb ones.","And does it feel like that\u2019s happening again this time? And maybe a better way to ask this, would you guys sell an adverse development cover to anybody right now?","Evan Greenberg","I am not in that business. What you see is soft versus the hard part of the cycle. People, as you get into, some are better underwriters and more disciplined in a competitive environment and they are to in this business than others are.","And some are aggressive to growth and they sell very broad covers and they sell them at cheap prices and they don\u2019t have the command and control in underwriting and so they get surprise.","And you put those two things together and now and again, there is a derivative business for garbage collectors, who come around new collection. And they collect the garbage out of portfolios and that\u2019s what you got here.","I am not a buyer nor a seller. I can\u2019t imagine that we would be in a position where it would make sense for us to give up a substantial percentage of our loss reserve asset and its future income.","Because we didn\u2019t have the risk management and the control and knowledge of our business that we would have to that will be so unsecure, we have to give up on our portfolio that way. Shrink our balance sheet that way.","It makes no sense to me and for us how we run our business, but you seen it, this is a business that has grown over the years. There are couple of guys have been pretty good at and they have done a pretty good job. So not everyone I would say gets burned at it.","But it is, this is an industry if you look at the ROE of the industry. And the mean is poor and there are both sides of that mean are those who outperform, on the other side those who underperform. And the ones who underperform they generate a lot of garbage and so the garbage collectors come around.","Ian Gutterman","Very apt analogy. Thank you Evan.","Helen Wilson","We have time for just one more person to ask question. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith","Hey thanks a couple of questions for you. first one Evan I'm just curious, are you at the point in the Chub integration where you are kind a comfortable enough that if something else comes up that you think you have got the not only the financial capacity but the management capacity to absorb a small mid-sized acquisition.","Evan Greenberg","I want you to know, I am looking at room full of colleagues will absolutely taking out [indiscernible]. You know what, we are focused on integrating and getting the power of the promise of all of the capability against - matched against the opportunities that this organization has right now. and I'm going to leave it at that except to say we have management bandwidth.","Brian Meredith","Okay great. And then my second question is just the VA volatility is almost like a nonsense. Is there any opportunity potentially to get rid of that at some point. Are you think you just going to stuck with it forever?","Evan Greenberg","No, but the VA and we are going to do this in 2017. We are going to split the life business into three pieces that you could see. Our international life earnings in total - I don't know the exact number. like $27 million this year and will grow they ought to grow substantially in 2017 and that's for our international life insurances.","Our combined underwriting income for the combined insurance company that's in the life division that part of it produces good earnings. And you will see those pieces. The VA was producing [indiscernible] at one point about $100 million, $150 million or $160 million year of operating income.","It's come down to about $120 million or $130 million. and now it's coming down to like $60 million going forward. And keep in mind this is that it hasn't produced good income for us, but with obviously the book value volatility that has gone with after the market.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Helen Wilson","Thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day."],"4895":["The Chubb (NYSE:CB) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 25, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","John D.

Today's call is being recorded.","Before we begin, Chubb has asked me to make the following statements. In order to help you understand Chubb, its industry and its results, members of Chubb's management team will include in today's presentation forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from estimates and forecasts that Chubb's management team makes today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such differences appears in Chubb's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In their prepared remarks and responses to questions during today's presentation, Chubb's management may refer to financial measures that are not derived from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in the press release with -- in the financial supplements for the first quarter 2013, which are available on the Investors section of Chubb's website at www.chubb.com.","Please also note that no portion of this conference call may be reproduced or rebroadcast in any form without Chubb's prior written consent. Replays of this webcast will be available through May 24, 2013. Those listening after April 25, 2013 should please note that the information and forecast provided in this recording will not necessarily be updated, and it is possible that the information will no longer be current.","Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Finnegan.","John D. Finnegan","Thank you for joining us. As you can see from our earnings release, Chubb had a great first quarter. We recorded the highest operating income per share and the highest net income per share of any quarter in the company's history. The quarter was highlighted by strong underlying performance in each of our business units and relatively benign catastrophe losses. We're also very pleased that the positive rate momentum we've seen in recent quarters has continued.","Operating income per share was $2.14, a 26% increase over last year's first quarter. Annualized operating ROE was 16.3% for the first quarter of this year. The combined ratio for the quarter was 84.6% compared to 94.2% last year. Excluding the impact of cats, the combined ratio for the first quarter was 84% in 2013, a 5.4 improvement -- a 5.4 point improvement over last year's first quarter.","Our overall gross and net loss estimates for Storm Sandy remained unchanged, although the CCI loss estimate declined slightly and the CPI loss estimate increase by a similar amount.","During the first quarter, we had net realized investment gains of $138 million before tax, with $0.34 per share after tax. This brought our first quarter net income per share to $2.48, resulting in an annualized ROE of 16.5%. GAAP book value per share at March 31, 2013 was $61.79, that's a 2% increase since year-end 2012 and 8% increase since March 31, a year ago.","Our capital position is excellent. During the first quarter, we increased our common stock dividend for the 31st consecutive year, and we also continued our share repurchase program, as Ricky will discuss later.","Net written premiums were up 4% driven by growth in all 3 of our business units. In terms of pricing, average renewal rates increased in both our U.S. commercial and specialty lines by high single digits in the first quarter, consistent with the rate increases we saw in the second half of last year. We also had continued rate improvement in Personal lines. We continue to push for rate as we focus on improving the profitability of our business in the face of low interest rates and the higher catastrophe losses that the industry has experienced over the past several years.","And now, for more details on our operating performance, we'll start with Paul, who will discuss Chubb's commercial and specialty insurance operations.","Paul J. Krump","Thanks, John. The Chubb Commercial Insurance net written premiums for the first quarter increased 2% to $1.4 billion. The combined ratio was a terrific 89 -- 81.9% versus 93.3% in the first quarter of 2012. The impact of catastrophes in the first quarter of 2013 improved CCI\u2019s combined ratio by 1.7 percentage points, of which 2.1 points were related to a decrease in estimated commercial losses from Storm Sandy.","Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI\u2019s first quarter combined ratio was 83.6% compared to 92.4% in the first quarter of 2012. This was an outstanding quarter as CCI benefited from continued favorable development and the impact of earned rate increases and excess of loss costs in our current accident year.","Much of our favorable loss experience is attributable to our underwriting initiatives, which we commenced in 2011, and which we have discussed at length on previous calls. At the same time, we recognize that we also had a measure of good fortune in the form of a very low level of large losses in our property and marine business, which contributed to its exceptionally low combined ratio in the first quarter. This is obviously attributable to luck as well as underwriting discipline, and it is unlikely to persist indefinitely. Accordingly, while we expected our performance will continue to benefit from the earn out of higher rates and underwriting discipline, we also believe that there is a good chance we could see some reversion to higher historical levels of loss experience for large losses sometime in future quarters.","We are pleased that CCI\u2019s average U.S. renewal rates increased by 8% in the first quarter, continuing the favorable rate environment we experienced in 2012. This 8% is consistent with the average renewal rate increases we obtained throughout last year. In the first quarter of this year, CCI secured average renewal increases in the U.S. in every line of business, led by workers' compensation and general liability, which were in the low double digits. These lines were followed by Monoline property, package, automobile and Excess\/Umbrella, all of which were in the mid-to-high single digits.","Turning to markets outside of the U.S., CCI saw renewal rate increases in the low single digits in both Canada and Europe. In Latin America and Asia Pacific, renewal rates where flat to slightly positive. CCI\u2019s first quarter U.S. renewal retention was 84%, up 1 point from the fourth quarter of 2012. The new-to-lost-business ratio in the U.S. was 0.8:1 in the first quarter, up from 0.7:1 in the fourth quarter. Renewal exposure change for CCI in the first quarter was negative 1%. Likewise, a smaller premium contribution from CCI\u2019s endorsement and audit activity had a slightly negative impact on first quarter growth.","Moving on now to Chubb Specialty Insurance. We are very pleased by the progress we saw in the first quarter. CSI's combined ratio improved to 87.4% from 93.6% in the first quarter a year ago, reflecting enhanced profitability in both our professional liability and surety lines. CSI's net written premiums increased 5% in the first quarter to $632 million. We are especially encouraged by the improvement in professional liability as we recorded a combined ratio of 92.4% compared to 98.5% in the first quarter last year, reflecting the rate increases and calling actions that we have discussed with you on recent calls.","Net written premiums for professional liability were up 2% to $549 million. Average professional liability renewal rates in the U.S. increased by 9% in the first quarter, this compares to 4% in the first quarter a year ago and 9% in the fourth quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter in which we secured higher rates in our professional liability business, thus achieving continued rate on rate.","Each of our professional liability lines of business in the U.S. experienced renewal rate increases in the first quarter. The increases were led by private company, D&O, and Employment Practices Liability. Both of which obtained increases that averaged in the low teens. These lines were followed by not-for-profit D&O, public company D&O, crime, E&O and fiduciary, all of which obtained average rate increases in the mid single digits.","In markets outside of the U.S., renewal rate increases for our professional liability business continued in the low single digits similar to what we obtained in 2012. Renewal premium retention for professional liability in the first quarter was 81% in the U.S., identical to the fourth quarter. The new-to-lost-business ratio for professional liability in the U.S. in the first quarter was 0.6:1, also unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2012. Endorsements had a slightly positive impact on professional liability growth in the U.S. for the first quarter.","Regarding the surety portion of CSI. Net written premiums in the first quarter were up 30% to $83 million, and the combined ratio was, again, a very good 50.7% compared to 56.3% in the first quarter of 2012.","As we have mentioned in the past, surety is a lumpy business. The large increase in premiums in the first quarter of this year resulted from new bondable projects that were won by our existing U.S. customers as well as from growth in Latin America.","And with that, I will turn it over to Dino who will review Personal lines and our corporate-wide claim results.","Dino E. Robusto","Thanks, Paul. Chubb Personal Insurance had another very good quarter. Net written premiums increased 5% to $987 million. And CPI produced a combined ratio of 87% compared to 85.5% in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes on CPI's first quarter combined ratio was 3.9 points in 2013 of which 2.6 points were related to an increase in estimated personal lines losses from Storm Sandy.","In the first quarter a year ago, the cat impact on CPI's combined ratio was 1.2 points. On an x cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 83.1% in the first quarter compared to 84.3% in the first quarter of 2012. Homeowners premiums grew 3% for the quarter and the combined ratio was 82.5% compared to 80.1% in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 6.1 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 1.9 points in the first quarter of 2012. The 6.1 points of homeowners cats in this year's quarter includes 4.1 points related to the increase in estimated Storm Sandy losses.","Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the 2013 first quarter homeowners combined ratio was 76.4% compared to 78.2% in the same period a year ago. Personal auto premiums increased 7% and the combined ratio was 94% compared to 91.3% in the first quarter of 2012. The strong growth in personal auto for the quarter reflected higher growth, both in the United States and outside the U.S. In other personal, which includes our accident, personal excess liability and yacht line, premiums were up 9% and the combined ratio was 94% compared to 97.3% in the first quarter a year ago.","The first quarter of 2013 was the 10th consecutive quarter of net written premium growth in the U.S. for both homeowners and personal auto. Policy retention in the first quarter was 91% for homeowners and 89% for auto, both of which are essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2012. In the first quarter of 2013, we achieved homeowners rate and exposure premium increases totaling 7% in the United States. Given rate changes either already approved or being planned for later this year, we anticipate the momentum of rate and exposure increases continuing throughout 2013. In short, we are very pleased with the performance and prospects of personal lines.","Turning now to claims, corporate-wide. In the first quarter of 2013, the cat impact on the combined ratio was only 0.6 points reflecting about $21 million of losses from 3 cat events in the United States and 1 event outside the U.S., partially offset by about a $3 million decrease in our estimated losses from catastrophes, which occurred in prior years. As John mentioned earlier, the overall growth in net loss numbers for Storm Sandy that we provided last quarter remained unchanged, although the amount of CPI losses increased slightly and the amount of CCI losses decreased by about the same amount. In dollar terms, the shift was about $25 million.","Now, I'll turn it over to Ricky who will review our financial results in more detail.","Richard G. Spiro","Thanks, Dino. As usual, I'll discuss our financial results for the quarter and I will also provide an update on the April 1 renewal of our major property reinsurance program.","Looking first at our operating results, we had very strong underwriting income of $485 million in the quarter, a 60% increase over the first quarter a year ago. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 6% to $288 million due, once again, to lower reinvestment rates in both our domestic and international fixed maturity portfolios.","Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $138 million or $0.34 per share after tax, with $0.14 per share coming from our alternative investment portfolio. For comparison, in the first quarter of 2012, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $56 million or $0.13 per share after tax, of which $0.02 per share came from alternatives.","Unrealized depreciation before tax at March 31, 2013 was $3.1 billion, which is unchanged from year-end 2012. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43.8 billion as of March 31, 2013. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.7 years and the average credit rating is AA3. We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At March 31, our holding company portfolio had $1.9 billion of investments, including approximately $250 million of short-term investments. These amounts have already been reduced by the funds we set aside to repay $275 million of senior notes that matured on April 1.","Book value per share under GAAP at March 31 was $61.79 compared to $60.45 at year-end 2012. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized costs was $55.57 compared to $53.80 at 2012 year end. As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the first quarter of 2013 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: in CPI, we had approximately $5 million; CCI had $125 million; CSI had $55 million; and reinsurance assumed had $5 million, bringing our total favorable development to approximately $190 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the first quarter combined ratio of about 6 points overall.","For comparison, in the first quarter of 2012, we had about $100 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $30 million in CPI, $20 million in CCI, $40 million in CSI and $10 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2012 was about 3.5 points. For the first quarter of 2013, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 90.2% compared to 92.1% in last year's first quarter.","During the first quarter of 2013, our loss reserves decreased by $343 million, including a decrease of $330 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $13 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The overall decrease in reserves reflects a decrease of $390 million related to catastrophes. The impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $70 million.","Turning to capital management. We repurchased 3.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of $326 million during the quarter. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $82.86 per share. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1.1 billion available for share repurchases under our current authorization, and as we said on our last earnings call, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2014.","In February, as John mentioned, our board raised the quarterly common stock dividend by 7% to $0.44 per share or $1.76 on an annual basis. This was our 31st consecutive annual dividend increase, a continued indication of our consistent performance and financial strength in a cyclical industry.","I would now like to say a few words about our reinsurance program. On April 1, we renewed our major property treaties, including our North American cat treaty, our non-U.S. cat treaty, and our commercial property per risk treaty. We renewed these programs with the exact same coverage structure as we had in 2012. The reinsurance market was orderly and there was plenty of capacity to meet our needs in each treaty.","In terms of cost, we had a very modest increase for our North American cat treaty, largely due to Storm Sandy. But after taking exposure into account, the price for this treaty actually declined in the low single digits compared to last year. In addition, we received double-digit price decreases on each of the 2 other property treaties which we renewed. Overall, the aggregate cost of these 3 treaties will be moderately lower than last year.","And now, I'll turn it back to John.","John D. Finnegan","Thanks, Ricky. In short, we had outstanding quarter. Record operating income per share was driven by very strong underwriting results. Substantial realized gains reflected excellent investment performance. And the combination of the 2 resulted in record quarterly net income per share and an ROE of 16.5%.","On the underwriting side, we benefited from both very favorable prior period development, as well as excellent current accident year performance. Favorable development came in at 6 points, reflecting continued benign loss experience. On the accident year side, we are also benefiting from favorable loss experience as well as the impact of continued rate increases. Our x cat accident year combined ratio of 90.2% is almost 2 points better than last year's first quarter and reflects strong contributions from all 3 business units, including significantly improved performance of CSI. Importantly, earn rate increases are now exceeding longer-term, loss-cost trends in all 3 of our major business units, all doing well for future profitability.","Of course results in any quarter are more a function of actual loss experience in that quarter than longer-term, lost-cost trend lines. Over the last 5 quarters, our results have benefited from very benign x cat loss experience, well below longer-term trends. We believe much of this improvement and loss experience reflects underwriting initiatives we implemented beginning in the second half of 2011 to call our existing book and to greatly enhance our underwriting discipline as it relates to new business.","On the other hand, we've undoubtedly also enjoyed a great run of good fortune in terms of non-cat-related weather and an unusually low level of other large losses. As Paul mentioned, this is particularly illustrated by the property and marine line, where our extremely low combined ratio this quarter benefited from the absence of almost any major fire or other large losses. And an unusually positive occurrence, which can hardly be attribute it underwriting discipline alone.","In terms of the current environment, the market remains firm as evidenced by the fact that we continued in the first quarter to achieve mid- to high-single-digit renewal increases on all over business units with generally stable retention levels. Going forward, assuming we achieve rate increases at current levels, we will see continued margin expansion. Although results in any given quarter would be more a function of swings and actual loss experience than longer-term loss trends, where we might expect some reversion to higher historical levels of loss experience for large losses as the year goes on.","On balance, however, 2013 is off to a great start from both market and profitability perspective, and we believe we have every reason to be optimistic about the rest of the year.","And with that, I'll open the line to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","John, I noticed this isn't an exact science, but if I understood your commentary correctly, it sounded like this was a very benign, non-cat weather quarter. I believe I could be wrong that -- I know last year was also benign, not cat -- non-cat weather, so was this quarter even more benign than 1Q12 ,and is there any way to put some numbers behind how low it was versus \"normal\"?","John D. Finnegan","I think that -- we've had some good, non-cat-related weather experience in the last 5 quarters. Now that's probably because we've had some pretty good weather. Although this quarter, it was a little bit different in that there were a number of storms, and yet, many are not cats and yet they came in pretty good. But we're up, I think, maybe 1 point in non-cat-related...","Richard G. Spiro","1.5 in homeowners against the first quarter, still a little bit lower than our 5-year average.","John D. Finnegan","Maybe 1 to 2 points below our 5-year average?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes. Yes.","John D. Finnegan","I would say -- so that's good. I would say the real -- the very benign loss experience we suffered -- we enjoyed in this quarter really related more to the lack of major large losses. Some of that in specialty, but primarily, where you see the biggest impact would be in the property and marine line. No -- there, obviously, our combined ratio is benefiting from another number of things. It's incredibly low at 60%, right, it's benefiting from a number of things. I mean, for one, you got about a 5 or 6-point positive from change in estimate on Sandy. We also have some good, favorable development against the year last year where we didn't have farther development in the first quarter. But -- and I can't overlook the fact we've gotten substantial rate increase in that business for a couple of years.","Richard G. Spiro","Yes. Over 20%.","John D. Finnegan","Yes. So that certainly impact it. But having said all of that, we had very few fire losses or other large losses in the quarter in the property line.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And lastly, on workers comp. One of your competitors put up reserve for legislation in New York related to reopening workers' comp cases. I was hoping you could comment on that. And also, just on loss costs and workers comp.","Dino E. Robusto","Okay. On the legislation, once you know -- I mean, the legislation was just signed into law in April and it's got many facets. So we're still analyzing the impact of the reopened case fund being eliminated January 1, 2014. Our review to date indicates that in recent years only a very small percentage of Chubb claims have been submitted to the fund, but we obviously need to complete our analysis on that. Giving you some information on work comp and just what we're seeing in terms of loss trends. Now I think it's important to keep in mind that our period to period claims stats may not be as indicative as the industry trends as we are less than about 2% market share. But work comp newer rise claim counts are down 3%. And from a severity perspective, work comp claim cost in the first quarter were somewhat favorable relative to longer-term trends in the mid to high  single digits. However, severity data, is inherently noisy, and considering the long-tail nature of these claims, our primary focus still remains on the longer-term trends.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","If I can slip one in on workers comp. Then lastly, the premium growth was flat versus high teens last year, is that just lumpiness as well?","Paul J. Krump","Yes, Mike, this is Paul. There's a number of factors that cause workers compensation growth to be flat this past quarter. The first thing, I guess, I would note is that the comparable and the year-ago first quarter was particularly strong at plus 23%. So we're comparing a relatively high basic amount in terms of the various timing-related issues that can affect the work comp premium. For one thing, the year-over-year change in audit endorsement premiums was slightly negative in the first quarter this year compared to a significant positive effect in 2012. Then we also reduced our participation in a large work comp program last year, and that had a slightly bigger negative impact this quarter than in the preceding few quarters. That effect was largely -- has largely worked its way through, though. So I want to make certain that you understand that should taper off from here. We also saw fewer favorable large new business opportunities and had a lower renewal retention compared to the first quarter of 2012. You have to keep in mind that workers comp for us is only about 20% of our overall CCI book, which is going to be a much smaller percentage than most of our competitors. And most of our work comp business is written as part of an overall account. So that being the case, our goal is to have this line produce a consistent profit over the long term. This strategy, along with our underwriting discipline will sometimes result in quarters where growth just lags or it surges. And going forward, I think, bottom line, what I'd say is we think that it's likely that our work comp growth will be neither as small as it was in this past quarter nor as large as it was in the first quarter of 2012. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on our thinking.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jay Gelb of Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My first question was on the negative 1% exposure growth in the quarter, that's a little contrary to what we would have thought, given the improvement in the overall economy. So can you discuss that a bit?","John D. Finnegan","Sure. I'm going to -- I'll have Paul address it.","Paul J. Krump","Sure. First off, the CCI renewal exposure change was just slightly negative. To put a little more color on it, we experienced some positive exposure increases in workers comp. But we're dealing with a fairly sluggish economy and we just didn't see that -- see it as much as we normally would expect to see. But that said, it's been running in a pretty tight range over the last couple of years of negative 1 to plus 1. So it wasn't all that surprising to us.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then on loss cost inflation, can you tell us about where you set your picks at for 2013 versus '12? And what type of underlying loss-cost inflation are you assuming in the CCI book as opposed to the specialty book?","John D. Finnegan","Let's talk about longer term trend lines and loss cost being about 4% in CCI and 4.5% in CSI. That's gone up in general -- each line, though, obviously, has significantly different trends. But that's going to be the long-term, loss-cost trends.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So that means it's coming in -- where 2% to 3%?","John D. Finnegan","Well, Jay, this is a -- it's not a science in this area. If you looked at the fourth quarter of this year -- last year and our results and compare it to the fourth quarter of the prior year, you would have attributed a -- if you just did it mathematically and looked at the improvement in combined ratio, the improvement in combined ratio significantly exceeded what one would otherwise call margin expansion, that is the comparison of earn rate long-term, loss trend cost. In the first quarter of this year, if you take the 5.5-point improvement in combined ratio, take out the 3 points of development, you get 3.5 points, you got 2 points of improvement in the accident year. And as it happens, mathematically, margin expansion was about 2 points on average in our lines -- or aggregate in our lines. So you wouldn't say -- you'd say maybe loss cost actually was experienced year-over-year, first quarter to first quarter, was about in line with the trend. There's no real science to that. And it moves from period to period, though. One of the reasons is the fourth quarter of 2011, loss cost are very bad. The first quarter of 2012, loss cost were pretty good. So I attributed the fourth quarter performance largely to better than -- loss cost better than long-term trends. The first quarter, I really can't do that except for the development area, which was very positive. Mathematically, it comes out to be about equivalent to margin expansion.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then, can you comment on competition for new business as opposed to your renewals?","Paul J. Krump","Sure. This is Paul, again. I would tell you that the competition for new is still alive and well, and that is one of the reasons that you see our new-to-lost business ratio's running where they are. Now that said, I want to remind everybody, and John talked about this in his prepared remarks, that we had some experiences in the past that were pretty rough, in particular in 2011. We commenced on an action to tighten the GAAP between the performance of our new business versus our renewals. And that meant -- the consequence of that was that we would see less new business. So we're being very disciplined in the amount of new business that we're taking on as respects the standard commercial lines and professional liability.","Operator","And we'll go next to Amit Kumar of Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","I guess, 2 questions. So the first question is on the CSI reserve release number of $55 million. Is that all favorable or was there any adverse in recent years, which was more than offset by releases from prior years?","John D. Finnegan","No. The answer is that it was primarily 2008 and prior were the positives. You get, in 2009 to '12, really, they come out pretty flat. Actually, 2011 was slightly favorable, '09 was slightly adverse, '10 and '12 were close to flat. So you take '09 to '12 it's flat.","Richard G. Spiro","And then you want me to give you a little colors, it's Ricky, you want me to give a little color on the individual lines within that $55 million?","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Absolutely.","Richard G. Spiro","Okay. So within that $55 million in the quarter, both professional liability and surety, although surety, for a lesser extent, were favorable. The favorable development in professional liability was led by D&O, but also from fiduciary and E&O. And there were some modest adverse development in both EPL and the crime infidelity lines. I hope that, that gives you a little more color.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Yes, that's very helpful. I guess related to that is, there have been some press reports regarding the News Corp settlement and Chubb, I'm not sure. Can you address that? And would that impact the Q2 numbers?","Paul J. Krump","This is Paul. Why don't I, just first of all, just to make the comment that we're not going to comment on any specific matters or whether we provide insurance to any specific customer because this case though was reported in the press, and it's a significant D&O resolution to a shareholder derivative action. I guess it would be fair to make a couple of general comments as it relates to our thinking. First, the size of the reported settlement underscores the value that D&O coverage provides the publicly traded companies, and in particular the protection that D&O insurance provides specifically for the individual directors via Side A coverage, who are the targets of such derivative -- of securities derivative actions? Second, from our underwriting perspective, it demonstrates the severity and potential volatile nature of settlement values in the D&O product line, which clearly puts a premium then on vigilant underwriting, prudent risk selection and appropriate pricing to fund for just such situations. Third, I think it really underscores and supports the significant efforts we have been taking over the last couple of years to drive increased rate along with disciplined underwriting in the D&O line. Those underwriting and pricing efforts will obviously continue in 2013.","John D. Finnegan","I don't think you shouldn't. Professional liability, you shouldn't -- it's complicated. You can't equate -- if you take anybody who's insured in that, and I don't know who the insurer is on it, but if you look at the insurers, see, you can't equate the timing of the settlements to the timing of a charge to income. These things tend to be case-reserved over time as they become more likely. Companies don't wait around until the settlement occurs necessarily to take them into account and they reserve positions and things. So it'll be a simplified assumption for any company to, when you hear about the settlement to think they've found that someone was insured to think it's going into the current quarter.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just trying to reconcile something here. So it looks like the underlying combined in CCI is about 96%, I think, if my math is right. How do we -- is that right or...","John D. Finnegan","96%? What's your underlying mean, by the way?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","X development?","John D. Finnegan","X development, underlying. All right. Well, if we look at the first quarter, I guess, calendar year, if we look at...","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","84% spot for you, sorry.","John D. Finnegan","Go ahead. Accident year x cat was 91% or so.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So your 84% combined reported and then minus, you had a negative 1.7 points of cats? Is that right?","John D. Finnegan","Yes, yes.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then plus, is that 9 points of development? 9.5, no?","John D. Finnegan","Yes. You have to double -- you have to watch when you have development in the cat area, you can tend to double count. But our calendar year published was 81.9% x cat 83.6%, accident year published 91.5%, x cat 90.9%.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, my mistake, my mistake. But I guess, I mean still -- so I guess [indiscernible] so last year, so you've seen that number improve by about 5 points over the last year, where you had rate -- I assume you had 8 points of rate 2 years in a row. How does that work? I mean, should we be seeing -- like what's the order of magnitude when you have the rate gains versus the change in the combined ratio?","John D. Finnegan","So I think if I look at accident year x cat a year ago, it was 92.8%. So you're talking about a 2-point improvement from the first quarter of last year. So if you looked at margin expansion in the first quarter, it was 2% to 3%, maybe about 3%. So you're saying that theoretical margin expansion is just theoretical. You'd say maybe losses were a point worse than long term loss trend lines, now that's cutting it pretty precise and nothing that's scientific. So it kind of performed along the lines of margin expansion. But having said that, as Paul pointed out in his remarks, I mean we had an awfully good quarter in terms of large losses. I mean, so you can't just extrapolate in for the future like that. This quarter, in Property and Marine was so good that when one takes into account margin expansion, you also got to take into account what the base year is and whether it's indicative, it's truly indicative, I mean you should extrapolate off. And I'd say this first quarter of this year, in Commercial, especially the Property, Marine line, we're a little bit fortuitous in terms of large losses.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you, got you. And then on the Specialty side as well. Yes, I mean you've -- is it fair to assume that the development, most of the development, is coming from professional liability or...","John D. Finnegan","Yes, 90%, yes.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right. So -- and then just maybe my math won't be right here, but we calculate that number about 100 and would be like 102, which is just a couple of points better than it was a year ago. I'm just trying to reconcile that versus 13 cumulative points of rate gain that you -- 4 points in the first quarter last year, 9 points this year. I would, is it -- are you setting your loss pick higher than where you expect to be, so you're kind of building more reserves? Or I would just think that, that underlying would be improving much more rapidly?","John D. Finnegan","First of all, you'd have to look at the earned rate improvement that in a -- if you look at margin expansion versus the earn rate versus longer term loss trend lines, in the first quarter, you're only talking about an improvement of about 1.5 points. You're accumulating 13 points written, not taking into account earned, not taking into account overseas and not offsetting by long term trend lines. So really, on a margin expansion basis, if I took the rate increases, diluted them by the lesser rate increases we're getting overseas, took them over time and took into account the expected loss cost trends over that time, I'd have expected about a 1.5 improvement in the first quarter on accident year. Now the answer is pretty good. We did have about a 2-point. We were at about 100. And that combined ratio and our accident year is about 100 in professional liability this quarter. Now our reported combined of 92.4% is significantly higher than the -- oh, so let's compare it maybe to the first quarter of last year. It's about 4 points better, of which 1 point was loss, 3 points was -- 1 point was expense, 3 points were loss. You compare it to the fourth quarter of last year, it's only about 1 point, 3 points better so the last quarter. But prior-period development was .5 point less. So let's call it 2 points better. But due to the significant seasonality in the quarter-over-quarter expense ratios, our expense ratio was 4.4 points lower in the fourth quarter of last year. And that was also helped by the treatment of incentive compensation due to hurricane -- due to superstorm Sandy. So our loss ratio actually improved by 6 points from the last quarter of 2012. So nutshell, loss ratio deteriorated over the year 2012. We had a couple of point better loss ratio first quarter to first quarter. And we had a 6-point better loss ratio, first quarter to fourth quarter.","Operator","And moving on, we will go to Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I want to talk about 2 items. The first one is that, John, you were very pleased with the professional liability citing a combined ratio from first quarter '12 of 99% going down to a 92% in the first quarter of '13. I also note that it was an 87% back in the first quarter of 2011. I realize talking much different quarters is kind of foolish in this industry, but maybe we can understand how much of this is pure rate and how much is loss trend? Was 2011 a particularly good year? Is 2013 more normal? Can we make any statements of this nature?","John D. Finnegan","We know that professional liability performance has deteriorated over the last year. We have talked about it at great length. 2011, a particularly good year at 87%. I don't have the data in front me. I'd say compared to what else happened in the rest of the -- from 2005 to 2010, I would think it wasn't particularly good. We had some better years over that period for sure. We had substantial favorable development. If you remember, we got huge rate increases in the 2003 and '04 period. After the WorldCom and Enron's, you have a lagged impact. We had a lot of development in the later 2000s but the net impact, what occurred is that, over a period from 2005 to 2010 or '11 we lost 10 points in rate. Rate went down 10 points. Cost pressure increased. You had the credit crisis. You had some sort of not directly credit crisis, but economic-related stuff and crime and infidelity. So listen, the bottom line is, we've expressed it, and I'm not happy this is where our professional liability was running. We think this is a good improvement. But this is a long tail of line of business. We'll see if it'll all comes out this way, but we still have a long ways to go. We have to get rates, and we have to keep up our calling actions. But we think this is a good step in the right direction. But no, you know you have to get to the low 90s in this business, and I mean on an accident year basis, not on a reported basis, to meet targeted returns, and we're not there yet, but a step on the right direction.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And the other question was to what extent are clients wanting to buy less coverage in the face of rising rates?","Paul J. Krump","Josh, this is Paul. We're not seeing any thing new on that horizon. I think when the financial crisis hit a couple of years ago, we saw some people asking for options around deductibles. They might have been lowering their umbrella in excess limits a little bit to try to ease the squeeze there. But quite frankly, that hasn't been anything that's really been impacting us much in the last couple of years.","Operator","And we'll go to Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just, I guess, first, I wanted to understand the development that you gave us, the prior-year development, that includes the change in the Sandy loss, correct?","John D. Finnegan","Yes.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So we need to adjust either that number or the cat number to make sure we're not double counting?","John D. Finnegan","Yes. So to give you an example, on development, if you look at CPI, they only had 0.5 point of the positive development. But if you took out the Sandy loss, they had 3.1. And CCI, go the other way, they had 9.6 sort of reported, but 7.3 if you adjusted excluding the cats. Did that give you a feel?","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. No, that's helpful, that's helpful. And I guess maybe the question is on the CCI development. Even if I take out the positive development from Sandy, it looks like a fairly robust number. And you gave us some of the details on the CSI development. I'm wondering if you can do the same for CCI?","John D. Finnegan","I'm going to ask Ricky to do that. Let me point out, last year, we had very little development in the first quarter in CCI, ran about 5 to 6 points in the second and third quarters, but it ran 8 in the fourth quarter. So at 7.3, excluding cat, it was certainly better than we ran for the year last year, but it was down a little from the fourth quarter. Ricky, why don't you talk about the...","Richard G. Spiro","Sure. So again, just to level set, so that the total development we saw from CCI in the quarter was $125 million. And all 4 of the lines within CCI were favorable. It was led by the Property and Marine line, partly due to what we just talked about, the change in the Sandy estimate. And then we also had favorable development in some of our other short tail lines like CNP property. And then the favorable prior period development in casualty was driven mainly by excess umbrella. And workers comp was also slightly favorable. And the one area where we had a little bit of adverse development was in the ANE area, almost all due to the environmental side of it. But that hopefully gives you some idea of what was happening underneath.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then accident years, I assume some of the later years as well, except for the property stuff?","John D. Finnegan","I think, I don't know CCI. I will tell you, in general, all of our accident years were good as a business. We didn't have any adverse accident years. So, yes, the short-tail development came from accident year in 2011 and 2012, and most of the long-tail development from 2010 and prior. And probably most of the development of long-tail revenue in short tails.","Operator","And now to Meyer Shields of KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Two questions, if I can. One, when we focus on CSI, I think the new-to-lost ratio was near 0.6:1?","John D. Finnegan","Yes.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Is it fair to assume that after you go through about a year of that, you've disproportionately lost most of the least profitable accounts, and therefore that resource should improve?","John D. Finnegan","We've talked in the past that we have already targeted e-fit in terms of which accounts we're looking to calls directly, which accounts we were looking to perhaps call indirectly by requesting rate increases we need, whether it's a dramatic rate increase as required. I think we've given, I don't know, do you have updated statistics, Paul, on which areas by segment whether something's come out?","Paul J. Krump","Yes. Sure, John. Meyer, just to think about this, our starting point really is the accident year currently at 100. And what John said just a few minutes ago is first and foremost in our mind, and that is we have to be in the low 90s on an accident-year basis. So we are taking a very tough decisive action on this book of business to get there, and that means that we continue to push rate pretty much across-the-board. Now that said, there are obviously cohorts and accounts that are adequately priced, and there are others that need a fair amount of rate. So we take it down to a very granular level. And it's a by-product. If you think about it by jurisdiction, but we are certainly out there pushing for rate in that area. And that will, of course, mean that we're also taking a very disciplined eye towards the new business just because we see sometimes business coming to market because the agents hearing the income wants to raise the price, whatever, x 10%. But in reality, we might price that thing up and say it needs to be closer to say, a 30% increase. Now when John talks about the tiering, or what we used to call or sometimes I refer to as the star system, think of it like movies. 5 star is great, 1 star is not that great of a movie. So in our 5-star range, we basically got a low-single-digit rate increases and had nearly 90% retention. And then in our 1-star accounts that were the worst, quite frankly, we were pushing up over or close to 30% rate increases. But there, we only renewed right between 65% and 70% of those accounts. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we're attacking the book.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","No, it doesn't. That was very helpful. I guess what I'm wondering is that after we go through 1 or 2 years of that, then it should be much less business in the fewer stars category because other -- it's gotten a rate or it's gone away.","Paul J. Krump","Yes. But of course, if you're still at 100, you still have a good deal, just on the lower averages, you must have still have a good deal of business that's above 100, and it's not generating attractive returns. So you still have to get at that. You have to have 100 average. You have to have some 110s and 120s still in your book.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Second question, I think I've asked this in the past. With regard to workers compensation or really any line of business exposed to medical inflation, are you pricing it at long-term inflation or is there a higher inflation rate because of the uncertainty as healthcare reform is enacted or implemented?","Paul J. Krump","When we think about the long-term trend lines that John was talking about, say 4% for CCI, that's obviously a composite number of all the products when we think about the mix. So workers comp has the higher number. And within workers compensation, different states will have a higher number. California, for example, would be much higher than the typical state. And we think about permanent partial disabilities and many different other factors when we think about medical inflation.","Operator","And we'll go now to Vinay Misquith of Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the pricing question. And it's admirable that you guys are going for 90%. I mean, are low 90s combined on the professional lines? But just curious, given the environment and given the economy we're in, how possible is that? And what's your view on that? And given where the stock is trading and the tradeoff versus buying back stock versus writing your business, how do you look at pricing, both on the professional liability side, as well as on the normal commercial line side?","John D. Finnegan","Vinay, I'm glad you think it's admirable we're aiming for 92%. It'd be more admirable if we achieved it, of course. The -- how possible is it? Well, I mean when you're at 100 and you were at 102, you're coming in the right direction, but it obviously takes a lot of work to get there. I might also point out, we're at 100 in the first quarter. The expenses are seasonally high in the first quarter. If we were in the same loss ratio for the balance of the year, we might be at 98% in the fourth quarter. It's still a long way from 92%. If you're getting 8% or 9% rate increases for a couple of years, it becomes possible. But setting targets is easy, achieving them is hard, and we have a ways to go. But we think we've taken a step in the right direction. And this has been a line that's performed very, very well over the last 10 years. I will point out, it's had a significant amount of favorable development. So you could go back to even the housing years in 2005 and 2006, and were we recorded low 80's combined ratios and you would find that our accident year combined ratio was still low- to mid-90s at a minimum. So this is -- it's not unusual that we have fairly high accident year combined ratios in professional liability. Now I think I'll turn it over to Ricky, the tradeoff question.","Richard G. Spiro","Sure. Obviously, when we think about our excess capital position and what we want to do with it, we take into account a number of factors including, do we have opportunities to invest in our existing businesses. I think where we sit here today, we think that we have enough excess capital not only to continue with our share buyback efforts, but also to support our existing business and any growth that we see in the foreseeable future. And I guess the short answer to come back on the buyback front is that we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders, and we continue to believe that our shares are attractively priced. As you point out, the price of our stock has risen recently, and obviously, the price-to-book multiple as well. On the other hand, we believe that our price-to-book valuations still remains attractive based on historical levels. And don't forget, interest rates still are very low making alternative investments somewhat less attractive. So balancing these considerations as well as a number of factors that we take into consideration when thinking about our buyback, we still see attractive economic opportunities at repurchasing our shares at our current price. So I think we're going to continue to do both, and we can make appropriate investments in our business as we see fit.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So that's helpful. Just as a follow-up. How receptive are clients right now to rate increases? So we've seen the order retention stay pretty flat. So it seems that there's no change in client behavior. But just curious as to how it is and how you think it's going to move within the next 9 months?","John D. Finnegan","Well, the people in the 1-star getting those 42% increases aren't too happy, I'm sure. I think that -- I mean, nobody is happy to get an increase no matter what the reason, right. But the market is up. I think in professional liability, we've been encouraged by the fact that we think we led that market, but we think the market environment there has improved significantly. So you have people reporting on calls that they're getting rate increases in lots of lines of business, high-single digits. And professional liability I think all the indicator are that, that market has firmed. So I mean, as you say, we haven't seen -- yes, we've seen a decline in retention from if you go back a year or 2, but we weren't -- we were writing business probably we shouldn't have been writing. So hopefully, most of the retention we've lost has been in the areas we wanted to lose it or we weren't able to -- we weren't willing to give it the rate base the customer wanted. So I mean the market stats over the last 3 quarters have been pretty consistent in terms of rate and retention. So I guess that's the best indicator rather than anecdotal events.","Operator","And we'll go to Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So just a quick question, or 2 actually. First, we're sort of halfway presumably into a cycle, wondering if you can give us any visibility. Are there any product areas or product lines, regions, anything, any place you operate where you feel like you're starting to see more competition rise? Or has it been sort of a stable environment over the past year?","Paul J. Krump","This is Paul, again. Again, I think just what John said, we've seen the market become a little less competitive in the professional liability seen here in the United States. The Australian property market, frankly, would be an example of some place I'd say that the last couple of years we were seeing significant rate increases, given the severity of the weather there. And that has slowed down, abated a little bit. Chile, after the last earthquake, was a very hard market, small, but it was very hard market. And that's abated after a few years of very large cumulative rate increases. So again, you have to think about this by line, by country, but within big countries like the United States, it can boil down to geographies, and sometimes even neighborhoods.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got it. The -- looking outside, looking in, this is sort of an odd market because there's some people that are very constructive in growth in this environment, and I think you guys are sort of famously not. Wondering how investors think that through and just if I sort of ask the anecdotal question just because it's sort of sprung into mind when you made the point about the 42% rate increase. Yes, I'm wondering, what price do you think that the market when that customer ultimately renews to somebody else, how much of an increase they were actually taking? And then I'll drop off.","John D. Finnegan","I don't know. The statistics that Paul gave you, about 60% to 70% of those people were retained, the rate increases we were talking about. So for a lot of them, there weren't a lot of good alternatives. These are accounts that have challenges. But obviously, the ones that don't come back are probably getting better rates. So I don't really -- I can't really tell you the answer to that question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Just a follow-up, I guess, on a couple of the other questions, CCI. John, you said the -- I was a little confused when you said the accident year x cat improved 2 points this quarter. And then you also said the fire loss were extremely low. So if I were to guess, that was maybe a point or 2, it seems there's sort of x, x, x underlying is kind of flat. So why wasn't there more improvement?","John D. Finnegan","Well, Ian, there's a lot of moving parts. I mean, what we said was as -- let's inventory what we say. We said the accident year improved by 2 points. We said also, we were coming off a pretty good quarter last quarter, where -- first quarter last year. It was a quarter which was benign on x -- a non-cat related weather. We did have a very favorable loss experience losses this quarter, but we also have pretty good favorable experience first quarter last year on losses not as good. But just doing your math, if you have -- if you take 1.5 in Personal lines from non-cat-related weather, you take a point or whatever you estimate on large losses in commercial, they kind of offset and give you the 2-point improvement, which is sort of in line with the margin expansion in the company. And that's not a CCI thing, it's -- the x cat you're talking about is for the company as a whole, 2 points.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Got it, got it. Okay. And then the other one is just when I was looking at the releases in CCI for the last 2 quarters, Q4 was, since you've been disclosing this, Q4 was a record high of releases and Q1 just beat it. I know part of that's Sandy, but basically you've had sort of your 2 best quarters of releases in CCI in this hard market, and I'm just kind of wondering, I mean you obviously use some detail lines are sort of what's driving releases to trend new heights?","John D. Finnegan","Well, I mean CCI, if you look at it, I think you'd should agree, should look at it x Sandy, right, it was 7.3 We ran 8.2 let's just say. So we ran in the 5s, so it's a little bit higher. But last year, the first quarter, we ran 3. So Property, I think the big driver this quarter that was out of the ordinary with a terrific experience in Property and Marine that we -- went the opposite way in the first quarter of last year. And that was what drove it up this year. We also -- we continue to have a good underlying in casualty, but the Property and Marine is probably what drove it up in the first quarter of this year.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Got it. And then just my last one, Ricky, this is a little bit of an issue. But the difference between your stat and GAAP expenses, the basically deferrals was $41 million, which again was abnormally high. So I was just wondering anything unusual there or is this just a new deck account that's causing change in the throw patterns versus the past or...","Richard G. Spiro","It's because the expense ratio was up a little bit.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","The stat expense ratio or the GAAP expense ratio?","Richard G. Spiro","The GAAP.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Okay, GAAP was okay. So that was sort of a onetime thing, you shouldn't expect it to repeat?","John D. Finnegan","Well, in terms of GAAP expense ratios, we have no reason to believe that's going to have a significant increase in our GAAP expense ratios this year versus last, and it could move a point in either direction. But it probably will be a little higher this year just simply because last year, we benefited -- because we benefited from the Sandy in terms of the impact on the incentive accrual. But other than that, it shouldn't be moved too much one way or another.","Operator","And this time, we have no further questions. I'll turn things back over to management for any closing or additional comments.","John D. Finnegan","Thank you very much, and have a good evening.","Operator","And once again, that concludes our conference.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Chubb Corporation First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Before we begin, Chubb has asked me to make the following statements.","In order to help you understand Chubb, its industries, and its results, members of Chubb\u2019s management team will include in today\u2019s presentation forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","It is possible that actual results might differ from estimates and forecasts that Chubb\u2019s management team makes today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such differences appears in Chubb\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In the prepared remarks and responses to questions during today\u2019s presentation, Chubb\u2019s management may refer to financial measures that are not derived from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in the press release and the financial supplement for the first quarter 2015, which are available on the Investors Section of Chubb\u2019s website at www.chubb.com.","Please note that no portion of this conference call may be reproduced or rebroadcast in any form without Chubb\u2019s prior written consent.

As we said in our press release, Chubb produced solid financial results in the first quarter of 2015. These were achieved even with the adverse impact of both cat and non-cat weather related loses, primarily in the Homeowners line stemming from the harsh winter in the United States.","The market remained relatively stable and we were pleased that we\u2019re able to secure rate increases, while again achieving strong renewal retention in all three of our business units. Operating income per share was a $1.57, a 5% increase over the $1.50 in last year\u2019s first quarter. The effective catastrophes were $0.69 per share in this year\u2019s first quarter compared to $0.52 per share in last year.","Annualized operating ROE was 10.2% for the first quarter of this year. The combined ratio for the first quarter was 93.9% this year compared to 93.2% last year. Excluding the impact of cats the combined ratio for the first quarter improved to 85.8% in 2015 from 86.6% a year ago.","Net written premiums, which grew 1% were negatively affected by currency. Excluding the effect of foreign currency translation premiums were up 4%. First quarter net income per share was $1.60 resulting in an annualized ROE of 9.2%. GAAP book value per share at March 31 was $70.33, up slightly from year-end 2014 and 6% increase since March 31 a year ago. Our capital position is excellent and we continue to actively repurchase our shares. In addition, during the first quarter we increased our common stock dividend by 14% to $2.28 per share on an annualized basis, which is Chubb\u2019s 33rd consecutive annual dividend increase, a continued indication of our consistent performance and financial strength.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dino.","Dino Robusto","Thanks, John. In a marketplace that while competitive remained relatively stable with regard to price, and terms and conditions. CCI and CSI both had strong performance in the first quarter. Each unit produced solid underwriting profitability and continues to execute our business plan, which emphasizes the retention of our profitable portfolio while seeking rate increases on those accounts that still require them.","We also leveraged our distinct underwriting and claims service advantages to write new business in our targeted niche market. Beginning with CCI, the first quarter combined ratio was 90.8% compared to 88.5% in the first quarter of 2014. The first quarter impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 3.4 points of the combined ratio in 2015 and 6.1 points in 2014. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI\u2019s combined ratio in the first quarter of 2015 was 87.48%, compared to 82.4% in the first quarter of 2014. This five-point increase was almost all due to a reduction in the amount of favorable prior-year reserve development in CCI, which in turn was mainly driven by a swing from favorable development in the year ago quarter, the modestly adverse development in this year\u2019s first-quarter and the commercial property lines including multiple peril property.","CCI\u2019s ex-cat accident year combined ratio remained very strong at virtually the same level as in the first quarter a year ago. Drilling down into the CCI lines, the all up multiple peril combined ratio was 96.9% compared to 91.8% in the first quarter of 2014 with a similar impact of catastrophes in both periods.","Property and marine produced the combined ratio of 89% in the first quarter of this year and 89.1% in the same period last year with a lower impact of cats this year. The casualty combined ratio for the first quarter of 2015 was 93.7% which is higher than the 89.7% we reported for the first quarter last year, but was more in line with our full-year results for casualty last year.","And our workers\u2019 compensation combined ratio continues to be outstanding at 84.1%, essentially unchanged from the 84% that we posted in the first quarter of 2014. In recent conference calls we reported to you that in light of the rate increases we had secured for the past several years we were increasingly focused on retention, while at the same time taking advantage of better priced new business in the market segments we target.","This focus is contributing to our positive growth. In CCI, first quarter net written premiums grew 2% to $1.4 billion. Growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation was above 5%. The multiple peril and property marine lines grew at 3% and 1% respectively, despite the drag from currency. In workers\u2019 comp which is largely a U.S. business, growth was at stronger 11%, but as we have pointed out in the past, this line can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter due to the presence or absence of a few larger premium accounts.","Lastly in casualty, net written premiums declined 5%, largely due to the adverse impact of foreign currency translation to a slightly higher than the impact on our overall CCI business, due to casualty\u2019s higher percentage of business outside the United States in the first quarter. Overall, renewal retention for CCI in the first quarter was 87% in the U.S. This is in line with our last three quarters and high by historical standards. Even with this high retention we were able to achieve an average written renewal rate increase of 1% for the U.S. book. This was the 16th consecutive quarter in which CCI secured rate increases amounting to three years of rate on rate.","Outside the US, CCI\u2019s average renewal rate increases in the first quarter were flat to slightly positive. With respect to new business, we continue to take advantage of our unique expertise in products and services to target the market segments in which we specialize. In the first quarter, in the US, our new to lost business ratio was 1.4 to 1, equal to the ratio in the fourth quarter of 2014. This reflects the high retention rate and solid new business writings that we believe will meet our performance target.","Indeed, the vast majority of our new business was written for customers within our proven niche market. Because we focus almost entirely on those target market segments where we offer value-added products and services as services, as well as unique expertise, winning the business is not exclusively a price-driven transaction, which in turn helps us generate strong profit margins over time. Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance, we experienced another very strong quarter, with the combined ratio of 81.9%, this is 7 point improvement over the first quarter of last year.","Professional Liability, which represents the majority of the CSI portfolio, our combined ratio of 85.2% in the first quarter was similar to the 84.6% combined ratio in the first quarter of last year. The continued strong underwriting profitability of our Professional Liability business is a product of our disciplined underwriting, skillful management of the portfolio\u2019s business mix, and culling actions informed by our use of advanced analytics and predictive modeling. Of course, the compound effect of the rate increases on our US book, which have exceeded 25% since January 2012 also contributed to our excellent combined ratio.","With respect to growth, Chubb Specialty Insurance net written premiums in the first quarter were flat at $621 million. Growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation was about 4%. Net premiums as a Professional Liability portion of CSI were down 1% to $541 million reflecting growth in the United States and the adverse impact of foreign currency translation on our business outside the U.S.","In the first quarter, we secured average renewal rate increases of 4% for Professional Liability in the U.S., just as we did in the fourth quarter of last year. The first quarter was the 14th consecutive quarter that we achieved Professional Liability rate increases in the U.S.","Despite our pressing for rate increases, we achieved strong renewal retention of 87% for that book. In markets outside the U.S., average renewal rates continued to be flat. In terms of new business, Professional Liability had another good quarter in the U.S., with a new to lost ratio of 1.2 to 1, as was the case with CCI. Our strong underwriting expertise and value-added services enabled us to find better quality opportunities in our target markets following several years of rate increases in underwriting action.","Turning now to the surety portion of the specialty book, the combined ratio of 54.8% in the first quarter represented a significant improvement over the 2014 first quarter\u2019s combined ratio of 122.9%, which was adversely impacted by a single large loss. Net written premiums of $76 million were up 6%. Bottom line for our CSI business overall, we are very pleased with the strategies we have implemented and we are well-positioned to continue to grow profitably over time.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Paul, who\u2019ll review our Personal Insurance operation and corporate-wide claim results.","Paul Krump","Thanks, Dino. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 2% to $1 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation was about 5%. CPI produced a combined ratio of 105.1% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 101.8% in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes on CPI\u2019s first-quarter combined ratio was 18.4 points compared to 11.2 points in the first quarter of 2014.","On an ex-cat basis CPI\u2019s combined ratio was 86.7% in the first quarter of 2015, nearly a 4 point improvement compared to 90.6% in the first quarter a year ago. For our Homeowners line premiums grew 1% and the combined ratio was 112.7%, compared to 104.9% in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 30 points of the Homeowners combined ratio in the first quarter 2015, compared to 17.9 points in the first quarter of last year.","There were nine US winter storm catastrophe events in the first quarter which affected 29 states and the District of Columbia. The majority of our losses were from burst pipes and ice damming, most of which occurred in February. While the damage was widespread across much of the eastern section of the United States, our New York and New England customers were the most affected.","Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the 2015 first-quarter Homeowners combined ratio was 82.7%, a 4.3 point improvement compared to 87% in the same period a year ago. Most of the improvement is attributable to the fact that fire losses this year were in line with our five and ten year averages, whereas in the first quarter a year ago fire losses were considerably higher than average. Not surprisingly, the impact of non-cat weather-related losses in the first quarter of 2015 was elevated compared to a typical first quarter. However, it was slightly lower than the first quarter a year ago.","During the first quarter of 2015, we achieved an average Homeowners renewal rate and exposure increase of 5% in the United States compared to 6% in the fourth quarter of last year. For our Personal Auto line net written premiums grew 2% in the first quarter of 2015. The combined ratio was 92.9% compared to an unusually high 101.4 in the corresponding quarter of 2014. U.S. renewal policy retention in the first quarter of 2015 was a very strong 89% for both Homeowners and Personal Auto, identical to the fourth quarter of 2014.","Net written premiums for Other Personal, which includes our Accident, Personal Excess Liability and the Yacht lines, grew 5% in the first quarter. The combined ratio for Other Personal was 92.3% in the first quarter, consistent with the combined ratio of 92.4% in the first quarter a year ago. Turning now to first quarter claims corporate-wide, as we announced on April 7, we had catastrophe losses of $250 million before tax or 8.1 points on the combined ratio compared to $199 million or 6.6 points in the first quarter of 2014.","The $250 million in this year\u2019s first quarter reflected about $264 million from 2015 cat events. Almost entirely from the ones in the United States, slightly offset by a $14 million decrease in our estimated losses from catastrophes which occurred in prior years. In the first quarter of this year, roughly 80% of the total catastrophe losses were attributable to CPI and 20% to CCI. And with that, I will turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail.","Richard Spiro","Thank you, Paul. As usual I will discuss our financial results for the quarter and I will also provide an update on the April 1 renewal of our major property reinsurance program. Looking first at our operating results, underwriting income was $205 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 5% to $264 million, due once again to lower reinvestment rates in our fixed maturity portfolios and to a lesser extent the impact of foreign currency translation.","Net income was slightly higher than operating income in the quarter due net realized investment gains before tax of $11 million or $0.03 per share after-tax including $0.03 per share from alternative investments. For comparison, in the first quarter 2014 we had net realized investment gains before tax of $116 million, $0.30 per share after tax, including $0.14 per share from alternative investments.","Unrealized appreciation before tax at March 31 was $2.9 billion compared to $2.7 billion at year-end 2014. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43 billion as of March 31, 2015. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolios is 4.1 years and the average credit rating is Aa3.","We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At March 31, our holding company portfolio had $1.8 billion of investments, including approximately $470 million of short-term investments.","Book value per share under gap at March 31 was $70.33 compared to $70.12 at year-end 2014. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $64.75, compared to $65.03 at 2014 year-end. The change in book value per share and the change in adjusted book value per share for the first quarter of 2015, both reflected an adverse impact of approximately $0.77 due to foreign currency translation.","As for loss reserves we estimate that we had favorable development in the first quarter of 2015 on prior-year reserves by SBU as follows. In CPI, we had approximately $5 million. CCI had $35 million. CSI had $70 million. And reinsurance assumed had none, bringing our total favorable development to approximately $110 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the first quarter combined ratio of about 3.5 points overall including a favorable impact of prior-year catastrophes of $14 million.","For comparison, in the first quarter of 2014, we had about $160 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $5 million in CPI, $90 million in CCI, $65 million in CSI and none in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2014 was about 5.5 points including a favorable impact of prior-year catastrophes of $7 million.","For the first quarter 2015, our ex-cat accident year combined ratio was 88.9 compared to 91.7 in last year\u2019s first quarter, an improvement of 2.8 point. During the first quarter, our loss reserves decreased by $107 million, the impact of foreign currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $370 million, and the effect of cats with increased reserves by $184 million.","Turning to capital management, we repurchased 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $326 million during the quarter. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $100.77 per share. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1 billion available for share repurchases under our current authorization. And as we said on our last earnings call, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2016.","In addition, as John mentioned, our board raised the quarterly common stock dividend in February by 14% to $0.57 per share for $2.28 on an annual basis. I would now like to say a few words about our reinsurance program. On April 1, we renewed our major property treaties including our North American cat treaty, our non-U.S. cat treaty and our commercial property for risk treaty. We renewed these programs with a similar limit structure to what we had in 2014, but with expanded coverage and improved terms and condition.","The reinsurance market was orderly and there was plenty of capacity to meet our needs in each treaty, as you might expect we\u2019re an attractive speeding [ph]. We achieved meaningful savings on all three treaties again this year with double-digit price decreases on our two major catastrophe treaties, as well as a high single-digit price decrease on the commercial property for risk treaty. In addition, in March we successfully completed our seventh catastrophe bond offering to replace the maturing cat bond.","The transaction was very well received by the market and this enabled us to replace the existing limit of $250 million and expand the perils covered relative the expiring arrangement at attractive pricing. Under this new arrangement, we purchased fully collateralized 5 year coverage to supplement our reinsurance program for our commercial and personal property exposures in the Northeast United States running from Virginia to Maine.","In terms of pricing, the coupon on the new cat bond is approximately 45% lower than the maturing bond. Similar to our previous cat bonds we have an indemnity based trigger, which means that our right to collect is based on our actual incurred losses as opposed to industry or index based losses. We like the diversification that these cat bond arrangements bring to our overall reinsurance program especially in our peak zones. Importantly, it provides us with a cost effective fully collateralized alternative to traditional reinsurance with pricing locked in for several years.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it back to John.","John Finnegan","Thanks, Ricky. As you can see, the story of the quarter was the harsh winter weather in United States with total catastrophe losses of $250 million. These cat losses reduced our operating income by $0.69 per share after tax. Nonetheless, we were still able to achieve operating income of $1.57 in the quarter reflecting strong ex-cat performance. Our ex-cat accident year combined ratio was an excellent 88.9% which is 2.8 points of improvement over the first quarter of last year.","We are pleased with our ex-currency of 4% in the quarter. In the U.S., retention rates remained at high levels, and we were able to achieve renewal rate increases generally in line with the prior quarter. We also continue to focus on capital management in the quarter, raising our dividend by 14% and repurchasing 3.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $326 million.","And with that, I will open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll first go to Josh Stirling from Bernstein.","Josh Stirling","Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. So I would love to start big picture around pricing. Over the last couple of years, John, I think you talked a lot about how the - how you generally sort of conservative underwriters look to try to cover their costs with something like a 3% to 4% assumption for long-term loss trends, and it doesn\u2019t always work out that you need all that. But with pricing now more like 1% to 2% in a lot of places, should we be thinking simplistically that, that means that the business\u2019s margins are going to start to decline, or is really the current business really adequately priced and at 1% to 2%, you\u2019re going to be able run in place and maintain the margins over the next few years?","John Finnegan","Josh, first, let\u2019s level set, 1% to 2% of CCI. I mean, that\u2019s a big part of our business, but it\u2019s not a majority of the business. Professional Liability was 4% in the U.S. Personal lines was 5% in the U.S. So when you look at it, and if you look now for 2015 accident year, you\u2019re obviously also getting benefit of the lag impact of earned premium, based on written premium that was higher in 2014.","So if you look at the 2015 accident year, and then you look at loss trends, which you properly stated 3% to 4% - 4% [ph] is long-term. We\u2019ve made a point of saying, but those are mostly macroeconomic that would take into account underwriting action, we believe 2 to 3 point, let\u2019s say, 3 points is a more reasonable assumption. So if you look at that, I would say in all of our businesses, in net, in the U.S., we\u2019re really probably on an earned premium basis in the 2015 accident year, a little bit - margin neutral to slightly margin profit positive. With CCI, the one you alluded to, being margin negative to some degree, but even CCI at current rates would have a 2 point earned premium, so it would only be slightly negative.","Professional Liability being slightly positive in the U.S. and personal lines being 1 point or 2 points positive and it\u2019s a couple of points probably positive. So, obviously the challenge is in CCI, but right now it\u2019s not a terrible place to be. But overall, from our overall book, 2015 accident year does not necessarily imply margin contraction. It could be margin neutral to slightly positive at today\u2019s rates in the U.S. Now, you\u2019ll obviously have to make your own assumption as to where rates are going and that could change it, although again, you have five - you basically have five quarters in of the 2015 accident year already.","Josh Stirling","That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019m wondering if we could just shift gears a little bit, you guys are sort of best known for your high net worth Homeowners and Personal lines, and some day we all aspire to have the yachts, so that we need to - so that you guys can insure us. But the question I sort of struggle with, just because we don\u2019t always sort of talk as much about strategy is. When you guys look long-term, how - what is - you have a great brand today, agents love you, you have good products, and you are sort of the one to beat. But there is a lot of energy and interest and focus sort of targeting the sector, and I\u2019m kind of curious how you\u2019re thinking about either I guess strategies or maybe tactics that actually maintain your position and really continue to grow that business over time?","Paul Krump","Hey, Josh, this is Paul, I will take a stab at your question. First off, we are all anxious to make enough to get that yacht, and I sure certainly hope you get there soon. So - but I would start out by just level-setting. There is a lot of energy around the high net worth space amongst a small handful of competitors here especially in the United States. And I think what\u2019s exciting people about it is, there is real opportunity to differentiate and to also take our market share from regional carriers and from the direct writers.","I would estimate that about 80% of the high net worth space is large direct writers and regional carriers, oftentimes just by default. Somebody comes out of business school and ends up being with a buddy from high school who is a local agent and they tend to stay there for 10 or 15, 20 years. And they really don\u2019t know what an independent agent can bring to the party and what Chubb Personal Lines can bring to the party.","So one of the tricks and the energy around us is to have certain campaigns that are trying to peal people out of the direct writer market. Another is to make certain that we are working very closely with our agents to educate them so that they speak the language of the high net worth and the ultra high net worth people. We are obviously adding to our products, as well, so that we can service them. Clearly, our international network gives us a huge advantage when it comes to the ultra high net worth, because as we all know they have homes and they park their yachts in kinds of exotic places and that type of thing.","And clearly, the fine art market is another thing. The art schedules are absolutely staggering for a lot of these families and we have the ability to put together hundreds of millions of dollars in art coverage on a single phone call. So we have deep expertise when it comes to appraisal, to preservation. Just, for example, we have I think 17 fine art specialists around the globe that are working on just helping with our customers preserve those - their fine art and that type of thing.","So a lot of it is around product, a lot of it is around service. But we are working very hard to make certain that our independent agents have the ability to really sell to these families and they know how to go out and pry them out of the channels that they are currently not tapping into.","Josh Stirling","Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Paul Krump","Thank you, Josh. Good luck with that yacht.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.","Josh Shanker","Good evening, everyone. I\u2019m not going to try and get a yacht. I\u2019m actually more interesting in the mass affluent market. And historically, I have always thought that Chubb had a better positioning there than maybe in ultra high net worth. Can you sort of break down, there are two different products and where Chubb is in both those products a little bit? And when you think about one of your competitors mentioned that in getting new customers for their high net worth business, the real opportunity is with people who were poorly insured by well-known carriers who are not really high net worth carriers. But when I think about that, that sounds very mass affluent like to me, not yachts and paintings. What\u2019s the market opportunity for growth in the two different markets, locally in the United States and internationally?","Paul Krump","Thanks, Josh. First off, I think we break it down by - we break it down a lot, but in three broad swaths. The first is our signature, which is the ultra high net worth. Then we have our VIP clients and then we have our - what you are kind of referring to as mass affluent, we just call them our regular Masterpiece customers. I mean, I do think that is where a lot of the markets resides that we can take away from the other channels.","I\u2019d tell you that\u2019s one of the areas where we believe we have a real distinct advantage against the high net worth carriers that are obviously trying to build some scale there. But we\u2019ve had our Masterpiece product vehicle and our back office setup for over 30 years now. So quite frankly, when an agent comes to us with a block or a book of mass affluent customers, frankly, what\u2019s so attractive is, we have the back office to help them and can handle that volume. So we really have offerings for those three broad swaths of the market.","Josh Shanker","Is the ultra high net worth market under-insured currently, would be my first question? And two, in terms of the market as a whole, what percentage of the mass affluent market do you think is with the wrong kind of carrier?","Paul Krump","As I said, just taking the last piece, Josh, and we think about 85% of the - of high net space is with carriers that don\u2019t specialize in the high net worth space. I\u2019m not going to say they are with the wrong carrier, because I think everybody that is not with us is with the wrong carrier. But we can\u2019t service everybody as you well know. So when it comes to the ultra high net worth and are they underinsured, I would tell you, you would be surprised how many of them don\u2019t, for example, carry more than, say, $5 million in excess liability coverage. And they are always shocked when we sit down and we talk to them about our ability to handle tens of millions of dollars in excess liability.","And then when we sit with them and we get them to get their artwork, for example, independently appraised, that market is absolutely on fire. And depending on their collection, it\u2019s not - I don\u2019t see a week that goes by where somebody isn\u2019t bumping up their art scheduled at least by $10 million to $15 million in value and that\u2019s just off their current collection.","Josh Shanker","And then I will get off. One last question, with all that going on, I guess, I just would imagine that you would have more growth than we are seeing right now against that backdrop. Do you think there is a temporary lull, or do you think that it\u2019s highly competitive? Where is the growth going to come from?","Paul Krump","When it comes from competition, I always have a hard time distinguishing between highly competitive, competitive all the rest. I\u2019ve been doing this for so long, it\u2019s always competitive just as a basis for that. I think the trick for Chubb and the others that are in this space will be around going after those people that are not in the channel. Clearly, it\u2019s not about just trading accounts with a couple of other carriers and taking margin out of them.","So that\u2019s where I think the struggle is in the United States, clearly, we are growing in other places. I would say, if you are looking at our overall growth, it was down a little bit. But you have to remember that, we are also overseas and currency impacted us on the Homeowners business, in particular, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, and the euro, so - and as well the Brazilian real came down. So those currencies all impacted our growth.","Josh Shanker","Well, if you\u2019re looking for a new customer, I think you can talk to Josh Stirling and he might sign up. I wish you all the best.","Paul Krump","Well, I think, maybe we could do a double discount. The Stirling and Shanker are credit here, so.","Operator","And our next question will come from Mike Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi","Hi, thanks. Just a couple of quick ones. In Personalized, anything unusual in the underlying there in terms of loss activity other than or maybe some of the sort of cat items you mentioned, or weather items you mentioned find their way into the underlying?","Paul Krump","I would tell you, Mike, that our clean trends overall were fine. Obviously, I\u2019m looking at them on an ex-cat combined basis, but actually our claims comp [indiscernible] slightly compared to our growth in premium. So it was really, outside of the weather, as John said, outside of the harsh weather in the winter, it really was a benign loss cost environment and that\u2019s really across the board. I\u2019m not just talking about Homeowners, I\u2019m talking about claims in general. I think workers\u2019 compensation, new arising claims were down 1%, which is terrific when you look at the growth in workers\u2019 compensation. And I think our new arise count all up were down about 3 points to 4 points, so very good results.","Michael Nannizzi","And do you see a lot of reverse inquiries after periods like this from maybe folks that aren\u2019t your customers that are neighborhood folks that are? And do you see that sort of activity, especially given the concentration of losses here being in your footprint?","Paul Krump","Absolutely. I can\u2019t tell you - we often joke, jeez, we are not big on advertising, but quite frankly, when I look at the loss costs of this business, that\u2019s really where the advertising happens. Whether it\u2019s a hailstorm, whether it\u2019s a wildfire, whether it\u2019s a winter storm, the way we bring clients back after, say, a first pipe loss and make them whole to the fit and finish of what they had pre-loss and somebody - other standard carriers bringing in just giving them $13 for a roll of wallpaper and we are bringing them back with their woven wallpaper and the rest of it, it\u2019s huge difference and that gets talked up throughout the affluent communities.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. And then I guess, one question I have, just bigger picture I guess on volatility of earnings and the losses recently. I mean, obviously, there is a benefit to them from sort of a marketing perspective, if you will. But certainly earnings have been more volatile for you guys than for peers and that volatility has really picked up again relative to the peers over the last five quarters or so. I mean, do you think about - is that something that you want to try to get back into line with peers or kind of look more like either you did before or they do now from that perspective, or do you just feel - are you comfortable with the earnings volatility that you have, even given just sort of the availability of coverage out there and the relatively attractive cost? Thanks.","John Finnegan","We\u2019d obviously prefer a less volatility if we could get it. But I think we\u2019re going to be subject to a little bit more given our concentration in the northeast and its being prone to weather disruptions. But having said that, I hear the talk that we\u2019ve been surprisingly volatile the last two years, five quarters, two or three quarters. But the fact was that in 2013, we rent a 3.6 cat load and in 2014 after initial 6-point first quarter, and 10-point first half, 5 points on average in the year, we ran a 3.6 too.","So we really didn\u2019t have unduly high cats over the last couple of years. If you go back a couple of years before that, Sandy and Irene, obviously, which back-to-back storms like that are unprecedented cause problems. But we\u2019ve got a quarterly blip here or there, but cats have not been unduly burdensome in 2013 and 2014.","Michael Nannizzi","Yes, I mean, I guess, I mean, so if I look at 2009 to 2013, you guys were running about 6 points on average for that period, similar to a large peer of yours. Since that point, your cat load is running about 50% higher. I guess, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s just that, from point to point maybe it hasn\u2019t been that pronounced, but certainly over the last year-and-a-half or change, there has been just a separation I guess was my point. So that\u2019s what\u2026?","John Finnegan","It\u2019s only run 3.5 points, so, over that period, so I don\u2019t know what the industry ran, but it can\u2019t be much, much less than that. I think if you go back to Sandy and Irene, you can\u2019t get away from the fact that, we are northeast concentrated. And the storms have taken place in the last five to six years in the Northeast. They haven\u2019t taken place in Florida. There haven\u2019t been any storms in Florida. So we have a little more volatility, but I think, again, sometimes we focus on the quarter and forget that the last couple of years have not been all that volatile in terms of annual capital.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. Thank you.","Dino Robusto","One additional thought there, be careful when you\u2019re making comparisons of cat loads across companies because every company may have a slightly different definition of a catastrophe. We, as we have said I think on prior calls, we tend to use the PCS definition in the U.S. Other companies may have their own version of what they are putting in cat, so you need to be just a little careful with that.","Paul Krump","The only thing I talk chime in here Mike is that, the other thing I think you\u2019ve got to keep in mind is what the bottom line is. And Homeowners, where there is volatility on a quarterly basis, when we compare our combined ratio to that of the industry over the period 2009 and 2013, which includes Sandy and Irene, we were a full 8 points better on the combined ratio than the industry. So it\u2019s really that is another data point you have to keep in mind.","Michael Nannizzi","Right, okay. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Cliff Gallant from Nomura.","Cliff Gallant","Hi, thank you. I want to turn again back to the high net worth business, and was wondering if you could comment on your strategy in regard to the commissions that you pay your agents. And it looks to me that you\u2019re paying something along the lines of 17%, and a lot of your peers - even those that are focused on that area of business seems like they are at least a point or two below that level. But given your, the product\u2019s reputation, the company\u2019s reputation, I would think that you wouldn\u2019t need to pay a higher commission. Could you talk a little bit about what\u2019s the thinking behind that?","Paul Krump","Sure, Cliff. First off, I don\u2019t know where you are coming up with the comparisons with the others in the high net worth space. When I look at them and then try to compare them on a by-line basis, because by-line really matters. For example, we have accident and health embedded in our Personal Line\u2019s other. So when I break them out by line, we are actually very, very close to what everybody else is paying, but for one carrier who specializes in Florida and when you write standalone Florida only homeowners, you don\u2019t have to pay that much in commission.","Cliff Gallant","Okay, so you\u2019re\u2026?","Paul Krump","We are very much in line, Cliff, is what I\u2019m saying bottom line. We\u2019re not - again to your point, we\u2019ve got the respected brand. We are the pioneers in this high net worth space. We have the international network. We have the coverages and the expertise, the ability to customize et cetera. So gosh I would be awful upset with our team if they were had to pay extra commission on top of that to get business.","Cliff Gallant","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll now move to Paul Newsome from Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Paul Newsome","Was there any change in strategy or thoughts following this quarter\u2019s impact with currency on how you think about your businesses or think about running the investment portfolio?","Richard Spiro","Yes, I would say, it\u2019s Ricky. I would say broadly no. We like the diversification there we get from having our international businesses. Paul mentioned, we think it\u2019s a competitive advantage in a number of our business lines, as well. We are very thoughtful about how we manage currency risk. We match assets and liabilities in the local currencies to try to minimize any potential currency exposures, so I would say, from a strategic standpoint, no change is anticipated.","We are very happy with our international operations and their overall performance. But I would say, while we had a big impact on book value and decent sized impact on revenue, the impact on earnings per share was negligible, it was a couple of cents per share. It\u2019s the price of being overseas. I don\u2019t know what the alternative would be. I mean, it\u2019s - currencies go up and down and we want to be overseas, we want to be diversified. I think most people would think that\u2019s a good strategy.","Paul Newsome","I didn\u2019t mean to imply either way.","John Finnegan","No, no, no, I understand, but I\u2019d be interested in hearing what would be an alternative strategy and we do not keep undue amounts of investments, assets in foreign currencies. In fact, the impact on our investment income is relatively negligible. It\u2019s a point or something of our overall investment income, but you do have to keep some assets there.","Paul Newsome","The only thing I could imagine is it would maybe increase or decrease your appetite for capital allocation one way or the other?","John Finnegan","No, not currency, unless you thought it was permanent, but it\u2019s obviously a more - it is a more complicated issue. I mean, it might decrease your appetite if the economies of the countries were poor, and of course, we\u2019ve had some - Europe has had some issues. You have issues now with Brazil in terms of their economy. Currency is part and parcel of it, but if economies remain strong, we can write business - profitable business, it won\u2019t change our strategy.","Paul Newsome","It\u2019s an unrelated question. I think you have a successful piece of your business where you have outsourced the claims. Maybe you could talk about sort of where you think, outside the obvious maybe in the personalized business, but in your commercial-sized business, where you think you really should have control over those claims versus places where it\u2019s not as important?","Paul Krump","Sure. This is Paul. I would tell you that the area where we typically use third-party administrators is in the accident and health business. And the reality is there, it\u2019s oftentimes, let\u2019s say, business travel accident policies will have things like a lost luggage rider on them. And it\u2019s a very - it\u2019s just not economically feasible to have a Chubb adjuster sitting in the United States, handling $5,000 piece of lost luggage. So and quite frankly, these programs are often sold through affinity groups, say, a bank credit card outside the United States.","So they are not really looking for the Chubb handholding, empathetic claim experience. The only other place where we really use outside third-party administrators to any degree would be around large risk management accounts in the commercial space where they actually request that and they are breaking out their cost structure that way, I don\u2019t know, Dino, if you want to add anything to that.","Dino Robusto","No, no, I think, that is a good description.","Paul Krump","Then there is the occasional loss of a secondary home up in Alaska or something and we - it is just easier for us to use a third-party administrator to go up and look at that type of claim than to fly somebody up from Seattle. So that is - we have great relationships with those people and obviously have contracts written up with them, as well, and we have what we call Chubb business consultants that oversee those individual relationships and make certain that if we use an outside vendor, that they live up to our standard.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners, L.P.","Great. Congratulations on the quarter.","Paul Krump","Thanks.","Dino Robusto","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. One of the other major P&C companies this quarter said that they thought that the amplitude of the commercial insurance cycle could be less severe going forward, and as pricing heads towards negative territory in commercial lines, I\u2019m just wondering if you would agree with that or if you have a different view?","Dino Robusto","Hi, it\u2019s Dino. I mean, it is difficult to know what\u2019s going to happen. I mean, clearly, there\u2019s some things in the industry that would have you suggest that there is potentially some structural changes to the cycle obviously, the low investment returns that you make, some of the increased analytics that are being used, some of the regulatory scrutiny, et cetera. Clearly, in this last several years, if you call it a hard market, you really didn\u2019t see rate increases the way you saw them in the last hard market cycle, so hopefully that portends that you\u2019re not going to see large rate decreases, but we will see. We will have to see how the cycle plays out.","Jay Gelb","Okay. Then my follow-up question is on reserve releases. If my data is correct, it looks like reserve releases of $110 million in the quarter, even including the benefit of favorable prior-year cat development is the lowest level of any quarter in three years. So I think a concern would be that this reserve release tailwind all of a sudden becomes a headwind. How are you preparing for that and do you think that is a possible outcome?","John Finnegan","Come at it from both sides. I mean, I think, I\u2019ve said often, Jay, in the past, on calls, especially when asked about our guidance and what favorable development was implied in it, that we had no specific levels of favorable development implied, but that over the long run, it seems hard to believe that we could indefinitely sustain 6 points of favorable development. I proved generally wrong, although we\u2019ve had some incremental decline in favorable development say, 1.5 point from 2010 to 2014, but that\u2019s 6.5 to 5, so it\u2019s pretty darn good. So pretty robust and it\u2019s fair to say the most surprising aspect of our recent overall reserve development has actually how significantly it has been sustained at such strong.","You\u2019re right, the first quarter was 3.5 points. But development can move around quite a bit individual quarters without signaling a significant trend. So I will give you an example - two example, development we experienced in both the fourth quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2010 were $100 million to $115 million, so very similar to the amount we had experienced in this year\u2019s first quarter. The same concern could have been raised for those periods. As it turns out, development rebounded sharply in the ensuing quarters. So in retrospect these less favorable development quarters turned out to be blips rather than a tipping point in the level of development. I can\u2019t say whether or not this will also be true with development for the balance of 2015. In the end, our reserve development over time is a function of actual loss experience, which is obviously difficult to predict. But I do think it could be very premature to draw such a conclusion based on one quarter results.","Jay Gelb","I understand it. It just seems, in 2014, seasonally, first quarter was a bit higher, actually it was pretty even over the year, but it doesn\u2019t seem like there is a seasonal factor there, is there?","John Finnegan","No, this year, if we got hurt in the short tail lines - there is a little bit of a seasonal factor to short-term lines, since they don\u2019t last long, right. So the Property, Homeowners lines, you see more development one way or another in the first quarter than the fourth quarter of that year and this year, it wasn\u2019t - we had a couple of big looses, it wasn\u2019t that positive, it was negative in fact, and last year it was more positive, so that accounted for a good amount of the swings.","Jay Gelb","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good evening. Just want to follow-up on Jay\u2019s question. You mentioned that you had some adverse development in the CCI segments in the quarter. Just wondering if you can provide a little more detail in terms of the lines that the accident year, as well what loss trend actually was above your original expectation?","Dino Robusto","Kai, it\u2019s Dino. I will give you a little bit of additional color. In the short sale classes John was just mentioning, obviously the absence or presence of the few large losses, which can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, can make a difference as to whether we have favorable development or adverse development in the quarter. In this year\u2019s first quarter a couple of large fire losses that occurred late in 2014 did swing, the Commercial Property developing adverse compared with the robust level of favorable development we had in the first quarter last year for the Commercial Property lines.","As I stated earlier, the 5 points increase in the ex-cat CCI result was mostly due to the swing in property development. So that gives you a little bit of a feel for what the amount actually is.","Paul Krump","That is on the CCI site. In the other areas, in CPI, most of the favorable development came from our Personal Auto book, again. The Property lines were not as favorable this time around. And then in CSI, it was driven mainly, as it has been for the last number of quarters, driven mainly by professional liability, but we also were favorable in Surety as well.","Kai Pan","Okay, that\u2019s great. Then on your guidance, it looks like the first quarter cat accounted probably, by my calculation, probably roughly about like 50% of your full-year budget in your original guidance. So I just wonder, is that you didn\u2019t change the guidance this time, is that because like your confidence in the remainder of the year, you will catch up, or is it just a timing issue, you typically update your guidance at the second-quarter earnings?","Richard Spiro","Well I\u2019m not sure I can ever say I\u2019m confident about what cats are going to look like. I would say that one quarter certainly as you heard John say, does not a year make. And he used the example, I will use it as well, but last year in the first quarter, we had over 6.5 points of catastrophe losses and we ended up the year at only 3.6 points of looses, which were below our expectations coming into the year. So we are not revisiting guidance at this time. We are not reaffirming guidance at this time. As you point out, we normally do relook at guidance at mid-year and we will potentially address this then, but at this point it\u2019s way too premature.","Kai Pan","Okay, lastly, if I may, on the reissuance program, looks like the pricing has come down quite a bit. So what is your thought about like buying more reinsurance that lowers your limits and could potentially lower your earnings volatility?","Paul Krump","What I\u2019d say, and I think I\u2019d said this on a couple of recent calls, we are always looking at ways to potentially use reinsurance, if we think it makes sense, to either lower volatility or help our growth or help our bottom-line results. We are quite comfortable with the reinsurance program we have today. We are constantly looking at new ideas. We have put a couple of things in place in some of our businesses, but we have never been heavy users of reinsurance and we are not going to change our overall strategy, the way we approach the business. We are generally growth underwriters and will use reinsurance if we think it helps us, but it is never that simple to just say it is cheaper today and therefore makes sense. We don\u2019t like giving away profitability if we don\u2019t need to.","John Finnegan","I\u2019d say from the first quarter, I mean there would be no reinsurance program that would have mitigated our costs. I mean the biggest storm was $150 million. No one, I mean in the industry is carrying first-dollar coverage on reinsurance, I mean that would be extremely expensive. So this isn\u2019t the type of storm or type of cat losses that are usually subject to having reinsurance coverage on. The storms are not that big.","Kai Pan","Thank you so much.","John Finnegan","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW.","Meyer Shields","Thanks, one quick numbers question. The other income line, I guess, the K described that as miscellaneous, so it was really strong in the quarter. Can you talk about what is going on there?","Dino Robusto","It\u2019s not a whole lot that I would point out. We carry in that line a couple of small items, one of which is equity in the net income of some of our subsidiaries, and frankly, that number went up a little bit in the quarter. We are not talking large amounts of dollars here so it is not a very big deal and that does swing from quarter-to-quarter a little bit.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Also, there was a lot of improvement year-over-year in the other Personal line\u2019s expense ratio. I was wondering if you could explain what happened there?","Paul Krump","This is Paul. As I mentioned before, this line contains our A&H portfolio. And the expense ratio will move up or down based on how much more or less A&H business we write in each period. Since A&H typically has a higher expense ratio, but it obviously has a lower loss ratio profile than the other CPI businesses. But then even within the accident business, there can be real fluctuations, driven primarily by the volume of that affinity accident business that I talked about before, where we are sourcing through, say, a department store or a credit card issuer, that type of a thing. Because that\u2019s where we have the highest expense ratio in all of our accident business.","So really depending on the affinity volume within the overall mix of the accident, and then accident within the other Personal, that is where you see the expense ratio move up or down a little bit. Bottom line, it came down a little bit because of the movement within accident, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest that, that\u2019s a bellwether or a new load that we\u2019re going to be running within the future.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Fantastic. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to Brian Meredith from UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Thanks. Good evening. A couple of questions here; first, Ricky, on the cat program, is it possible to give it a sense of what do you think the rate reductions impact on written premium are going to be? And how much that falls to the bottom line? Because I see a gross to net written premium with the stuff that you disclosed, so I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what that might look like, if it would benefit by 20 basis points?","Richard Spiro","It would only be a couple-of-tenth of a point.","Brian Meredith","So not that much?","Richard Spiro","No.","Brian Meredith","Is it going to be mostly in the Homeowners area where you see the benefit?","Richard Spiro","All of our property\u2026","Paul Krump","Or property for risk too. Yes.","Richard Spiro","Yes.","Brian Meredith","Got you. Got you. Okay. And next question, is it possible to get what the FX impact was on the Homeowners line? And I think you said on the professional liability line.","Richard Spiro","Yes, Brian, we are not going to disclose at the line level. I think in both Paul and Dino\u2019s remarks, they mentioned - they gave the overall sort of CPI impact and the overall CSI impact. With the exception of the line that Dino pointed out, which was casualty at a slightly higher impact, it\u2019s probably safe to assume a similar impact by individual line as to the overall for the SBU.","John Finnegan","So think 3 points and you wouldn\u2019t be far off.","Brian Meredith","Okay. Terrific. And then last question, I\u2019m just curious, on your CCI business, you talk about rate activity in the U.S. What is it looking like internationally?","Dino Robusto","Yes. As I mentioned, we are getting probably flat to slightly positive rate activity and our retention ratios outside the U.S. are essentially close to what they are in the U.S. sort of mid-80s, 85, 86, 87 rate. It\u2019s interesting the rate has been quite stable actually. It had been traditionally lower than the increases we were getting in the U.S., but it essentially stayed there, so it is in the flat to slightly positive.","Brian Meredith","Great, thanks for the answers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis","Great, thanks. So I guess my first question was I guess also on some of the PYD [ph], and in particular, I guess in commercial. I know you guys said that the combined ratio - I\u2019m sorry, this is in commercial casualty - the combined ratio there was a little elevated, but it was kind of in line with last year. Was there any environmental toxic waste or asbestos type stuff that was in there this quarter?","Paul Krump","A small amount, yes, we incurred $1 million of asbestos losses and $5 million of environmental losses in the first quarter.","Ryan Tunis","Got it, okay. And then it looked like to me, that underwriting results outside the United States actually looked pretty strong this quarter relative to kind of where they have been running. And I guess just curious, how much of that you would either consider unusually strong versus - I know you guys had taken some underwriting actions there? And also, where did you guys tend to see the help from that? Was that in Personal lines or Commercial or Specialty?","Unidentified Company Representative","They\u2019re pretty well everywhere.","John Finnegan","I think it was reasonably across-the-board. But I wouldn\u2019t point to it as the beginning of a trend. It was a good quarter. Quarters fluctuate, and given the fact we are not getting a sizable amount of rate overseas, it would be hard to say that there is going to be huge improvements on a trend line basis. Obviously, quarters fluctuate by loss externs [ph]. A lot of it is luck. We think we have good underwriting in place, but I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. I think the last few quarters were a little high, this one was probably pretty good, we\u2019ll see.","Ryan Tunis","Got it. And then just one more, I guess is sort of bigger picture just on capital return philosophy. I guess, last quarter, you guys gave us a share repurchase authorization. It was a little less than last year. And I think you also indicated you felt good about your excess capital position. And I think you said that the reason it was a little less than last year was you like to be able to move it around maybe based on where the share price is.","Just curious if Chubb would consider deployment of capital in some other form other than share repo? And I guess longer-term along those lines, how does Chubb think about the right amount of capital that\u2019s required to kind of support the risk to this business through the cycle and how does that compare to the way the business is currently capitalized? Thanks.","Richard Spiro","Sure, it\u2019s Ricky. I will take a shot at answering that. First off, I think what we said last quarter when we announced the new share repurchase program was that it is sort of in line with what our expected earnings are for the year, less shareholder dividends, and that sort of the overall philosophy. And I\u2019d say, it wasn\u2019t the stock price that drove the size of our share repurchase.","We have a philosophy that we have articulated over the last few years that our intent, obviously, market conditions and other things all being equal, that our share buyback will in essence be in line with our earnings less shareholder dividend. And that is how we came out with the size of the program. We do believe that we are in a very strong excess capital position, we do - we think very - we think a lot about, our deployment of capital and what\u2019s the right amount. We think about all the different types of capital deployment strategies. We are very comfortable with our share repurchase. When years past, if you looked at what we\u2019ve done, when we had more opportunity from evaluation perspective or others, we might do something slightly larger than our earnings less dividend. So we\u2019re careful in how we manage it and we\u2019re very aware of being good stewards of our capital for our shareholders.","So we do think about all the different options. I\u2019m not going to comment on which ones we may or may not think about in the future. I\u2019ll also point out as John mentioned we\u2019ve increased our common dividend for the last 33 years which is another piece of how we manage our capital position. So again, in summary we feel very good about where we are and the way we approach this, and nothing is really different than what we\u2019ve been doing over number of years.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks, guys.","John Finnegan","Sure. And I think, Jessica, we\u2019re going to take one more question.","Operator","Okay. And our final question will come from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen","Great. Thanks for sticking around. Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick one, the currency impact, as we think short-term, the next several quarters, would you expect the impact on premiums from the stronger dollar to be similar to the first quarter, stronger or weaker?","Richard Spiro","I think obviously it depends on the comparison of the movement of currency quarter to quarter. I would think that in the second and third quarters, remember most of the currency movement that has happened started in the fourth quarter of last year and then continued into the first quarter of this year. So all other things being equal, currency stays where it was at the end of March. Then you will still see an impact on growth in certainly the second and third quarters. Then I\u2019m not saying whether it\u2019d be similar to what we had in the first quarter, I don\u2019t know. But certainly there will be an impact.","We did it in the guidance that we put out in January. We did say that we expect a 2 point impact for the full year, so maybe that can give you some help there as well. As, John mentioned, from an earnings perspective it doesn\u2019t have a very large impact on a quarterly basis. It\u2019s a $0.02 a share in the first quarter. Bear in mind, when you think about the investment income piece, a large part of our after tax investment income comes from the municipal bond portfolio here in the U.S. So it\u2019s a slightly disproportionate impact on investment income in the U.S.","Last point I make on book value is, again, if currencies don\u2019t change from where they were at the end of March, which is a pretty big assumption. The impact on book value will probably be meaningfully less than the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. It won\u2019t be zero because we have some of our foreign operations that report on a one quarter lag which we\u2019ve highlighted in our 10-K, so there will be an impact, but it shouldn\u2019t be nearly as large as it was in the first quarter.","Hopefully, that gives you some help.","Jay Cohen","Yes, now, that\u2019s great, Ricky. Thank you.","Richard Spiro","Great. Operator, I think we\u2019re finished.","Operator","Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.","John Finnegan","Thank you."],"4884":["The Chubb (NYSE:CB) Q4 2011 Earnings Call January 26, 2012  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Richard G.

Finnegan","Thank you for joining us. We have strong results in the fourth quarter and after experiencing record catastrophe losses in the first 9 months, I'm happy to say that we had a much lower level of cats this quarter. Given the continued weakness in the global economy and low-interest rates, we're especially pleased that we produced $452 million of net income for the quarter. Operating income per share was $1.63 and annualized operating ROE was 13.1% for the quarter. Net income per share was $1.60 and annualized ROE was 11%. Net written premiums for the fourth quarter were up 4%, reflecting rate improvements in all 3 of our business units. We continue to see sustained momentum in the standard commercial rate increases that we've been discussing for the last few quarters. And in professional liability, we secured rate increases for the first time in 2 years. We also obtained rate increases in Personal lines. Nevertheless, our marketplace is still very competitive and we remain steadfastly focused on writing profitable business. ","GAAP book value per share at 2011 year end was $57.15, up 2% compared to the end of the third quarter, and up 9% compared to year end 2010. Our capital position is strong and Ricky will talk about capital management including the new share repurchase program we announced today. As you saw in our press release, we provided operating income per share guidance for 2012 of $5.30 to $5.70. We'll have more to say later on guidance as well as our full-year results. ","And now, Paul will discuss the performance of Chubb's commercial and specialty insurance operations and provide some market color.","Paul J. Krump","Thanks, John. At Chubb Commercial Insurance, net written premiums for the fourth quarter were up 8% to $1.2 billion. The combined ratio was 93.2 versus 93.5 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's fourth quarter combined ratio was 93.6 compared to 91 in the fourth quarter of 2010, driven largely by higher losses in property. For the full year, the impact of catastrophes accounted for 10.5 percentage points of CCI's combined ratio in 2011, compared to 5.4 points in 2010. ","We are pleased that CCI's average United States renewal rates were up 6% in the fourth quarter. Rate momentum continue to build as evidenced by the fact that the fourth quarter's 6% compares to the 4% we reported in the third quarter, 2% in the second quarter and flat in the first quarter. Retention for the fourth quarter was 85%, the same as in the third quarter. The new to lost business ratio was 1.1:1, slightly higher than the third quarter and a little lower than the average for the year. Even more encouraging is the fact that CCI's secured United States renewal rate increases in each line of business in the fourth quarter. Monoline property rates increased the most, reaching the double-digit mark, followed in order by general liability, worker's compensation, excess umbrella, package, commercial automobile, boiler and marine. Also indicative of the improving pricing environment is that only about 10% of the CCI business we renewed in the fourth quarter received a rate decrease, compared to about 50% in the fourth quarter of 2010. ","On the flip side, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we secured rate increases on 70% of the renewed business, compared to 30% in the fourth quarter of 2010. In markets outside of the United States, CCI obtained renewal rate increases in Canada as well as continued increases in countries that experienced recent catastrophes such as Japan, New Zealand and Australia. Rates in Europe continued to be flat. ","Turning to CSI, net written premiums for professional liability were down 2% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $648 million, and the combined ratio was 96.1 compared to 88.7 in the fourth quarter of 2010. Based on our year-end analysis, we raised our estimate for the professional liability combined ratio in accident year 2011. The increase was primarily in the crime and employment practices liability classes, which have been adversely affected by the economic downturn. As you know, the crime class is inherently lumpy and in the fourth quarter, we experienced some heavy, large loss activity in accident year 2011. We also made modest increases to our accident year 2011 estimates in public D&O, reflecting the rising cost of merger and acquisition objection claims. ","In the quarter, the overall professional liability accident year 2011 results therefore reflect a modest underwriting loss, which was more than offset by continued favorable development on prior accident years. For the full year, accident year 2011 for professional liability is at about an underwriting break even and our calendar year results benefited from significant favorable development. ","With respect to the rate environment, we are pleased that average renewal rates for professional liability in the United States turned positive in the fourth quarter, averaging 1%. For perspective, that positive 1% compares to the negative 1% we reported in the third quarter, negative 2% in the second quarter and negative 3% in the first quarter of 2011. The last time we obtained positive rate increases in the United States for professional liability was 2009 when there was a fair amount of market disruption in the wake of the financial crisis. Prior to that, rates had not increased since the first quarter of 2004. ","CSI renewal retention was 85% in the fourth quarter, a decline from the 89% we've reported in the third quarter of 2011. We believe the trade-off of retention for rate was a good one made even better as we carefully called our least attractive business. The new to lost business ratio was 0.7:1 in the fourth quarter, down from 1.3:1 in the third quarter, as we took an especially disciplined underwriting and pricing approach to new business. ","A review of renewal rates by line of business in the fourth quarter for professional liability in the United States is encouraging. Importantly, rates for all 3 segments of our Directors and Officers liability book of business, those segments being public companies, private companies and not-for-profit entities, all experienced low single-digit increases. Regarding the renewal rates for our other professional liability lines of business, crime, employment practices liability and fiduciary were positive in the fourth quarter while financial fidelity and errors and omissions were flat. ","Outside of the United States, the rate environment for professional liability remains unchanged in the fourth quarter with average rates down by low single digits. ","Regarding the surety portion of our CSI book, net written premiums in the fourth quarter were up 6% to $88 million and the combined ratio was 47%. ","And with that, I will turn it over to Dino, who will review Personal Lines and Claims.","Dino E. Robusto","Thanks, Paul, and good evening, everyone. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 3% in the fourth quarter to $991 million. CPI produced a combined ratio of 86.9 compared to 83.7 in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes for the quarter was 1.6 points in 2011, whereas in the fourth quarter of 2010, the impact of cats was 1 point. For the full year, CPI produced a combined ratio of 98.3 including 13.1 percentage points of catastrophes, compared to a combined ratio of 91.5 including 10.2 points of catastrophes in 2010. ","The large impact events in 2011 for CPI were Hurricane Irene, the tornadoes and wind storms in the U.S. and the flooding and cyclone in Australia. Homeowners premiums were up 3% for the quarter and the combined ratio was 82.3, compared to 78.8 in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 3 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 2 points in the fourth quarter of 2010. While cat losses were low in the quarter, we did experience relatively higher non-catastrophe weather-related water, wind and brushfire losses in the U.S. In the fourth quarter of 2011, non-cat weather-related losses in the U.S. accounted for about 6 points of the worldwide homeowners combined ratio, which is 3 points higher than the impact in the fourth quarter of 2010. For all of 2011, non-catastrophe weather-related losses in the U.S. accounted for about 8 points of the worldwide homeowners combined ratio, compared to an average of only 5 points over the prior 5 years. ","In part, due to the recent heavy cat and non-cat weather-related losses, we are now filing for homeowners rate increases in the U.S., mostly in the 5% to 6% range, compared to earlier in 2011 when they were in the 3% to 4% range and we anticipate filing for additional rate increases as needed. Given the widespread rate taking in the general market, we do not think this will have a significant impact on our retention or our ability to attract new customers as evidenced by our experience in 2011. ","Indeed, in the fourth quarter of 2011, homeowners in the U.S. had its 8th consecutive quarterly increase in policy count retention, ending the year with a U.S. homeowners retention rate of 91% nearly a point higher than a year earlier. Homeowners new business was also up increasing 8% for the year. ","Personal auto premiums increased 1% and the combined ratio was 93.3. Like homeowners, personal auto policy count retention increased by 1 point from a year earlier to 89%. ","In other Personal lines, premiums were up 4% driven largely by growth outside the United States. The combined ratio was 94.7. In short, we are very pleased with the performance of our Personal Lines business. ","Turning now to claims. As John mentioned, the big story of the year was catastrophes, which accounted for 8.9 percentage points of the 2011 combined ratio for Chubb as a whole. Fortunately, the extraordinarily high level of catastrophe losses we experienced in each of the first 3 quarters of the year was not repeated in the fourth quarter. There were 4 cat events outside the U.S. during the fourth quarter. For the industry, the most noteworthy was the Thailand flooding, but that was not a major event for Chubb. ","In the U.S., there were 2 cat events, the more significant of which was the late October snowstorm. Fourth quarter cat events represented about 2.5 points of our combined ratio but were partially offset by about 2 points of benefit from downward revisions of our estimated losses from catastrophes that occurred in the first 3 quarters of 2011. ","On previous calls, I've spoken about how highly our customers rate our claim service. I can now give you numbers for all of 2011 including catastrophe claims. 97% of homeowner customers responding to our post claim surveys were highly satisfied with Chubb's service, which is the highest rating on the survey form. Given the plethora of cat events throughout most of this year, this is a result we are very proud of. One final word about claims, the number of new claims related to the credit crisis was insignificant throughout 2011 and losses are developing consistent with our expectations. ","And now, I'll turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail.","Richard G. Spiro","Thanks, Dino. Looking first at our operating results, underwriting income was $284 million in the quarter, property and casualty investment income after tax was down 1% to $316 million in the quarter due primarily to the continued decline in reinvestment rates. Net income was lower than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment losses before tax of $12 million or $0.03 per share after tax, largely driven by losses from our alternative investments. For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $155 million or $0.33 per share after tax. Unrealized appreciation before tax at December 31, 2011 was $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately $400 million from the end of the third quarter. For comparison, at year-end 2010, unrealized appreciation before tax was $1.7 billion. ","The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $42.8 billion as of December 31, 2011. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.7 years and the average credit rating is Aa2.","In light of the headlines surrounding Europe, I thought I would take this opportunity to give you an update on our international investment portfolio, which represented 24% of our total invested assets at December 31, 2011. Our international investment portfolio totaled $10.1 billion of which, $10 billion was invested in high-quality fixed maturity securities and short-term investments. The international fixed maturity portfolio had an average credit rating of Aa2 and was heavily concentrated in AAA rated sovereigns and supernationals. Our 5 largest sovereign exposures are Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany and Brazil, which accounted for 50% of our total international investment portfolio. At year-end, we had no exposure to sovereigns in Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Italy, and only $13 million of exposure in Spain. Our total exposure in the so called PIGS countries including non-sovereign was less than 2% of our international investment portfolio and less than 0.5% of our total invested assets. ","We also continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At December 31, 2011, our holding company portfolio had $2.2 billion of investments including $1 billion of short-term investments. This reflects the repayment of $400 million of senior notes that matured in November. Book value per share under GAAP, at December 31, 2011, was $57.15 compared to $52.24 at year end 2010, an increase of 9%. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available for sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $51.38 compared to $49.05 at year end 2010. With respect to the changes in book value during the quarter, I'd like to point out that the positive impact of the increase in our unrealized gain position due to the decline in interest rates was approximately offset by the adverse impact of lower interest rates on the value of our pension liability. ","As I mentioned on our last earnings call, and as we described in our most recent 10-Q, in the first quarter of 2012, we will adopt a new guidance related to the accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. We expect that the financial impact of the adoption of this guidance will be consistent with our previous disclosures. ","Turning to reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the fourth quarter of 2011 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CPI, we had approximately $35 million, CCI had $90 million, CSI had $55 million and reinsurance assumed had $5 million. Bringing the total favorable development to approximately $185 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the fourth quarter combined ratio of about 6 points overall. For comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we had about $145 million of favorable development for the company overall, including about $25 million in CPI, $50 million in CCI, $60 million in CSI and $10 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2010 was about 5 points. ","Favorable development for the full-year 2011 totaled about $765 million and had a favorable impact on the combined ratio of approximately 6.5 points. ","During the fourth quarter, our loss reserves decreased by $455 million including a decrease of $435 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $20 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The impact of catastrophes reduced reserves by about $320 million and the impact of currency fluctuation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $90 million. ","Turning now to capital management. We repurchased 6 million shares at an aggregate cost of $396 million during the fourth quarter. The average cost of our repurchases was $66.10 per share. For the full-year 2011, we repurchased 27.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.7 billion and an average cost of $62.30 per share. As of December 31, 2011, there were approximately 909,000 shares remaining under our December 2010 repurchase program. During January of this year, we repurchased all the remaining shares under this program at an average cost of $69.66 per share. Since December 2005, we have repurchased a total of 185 million shares at a total cost of almost $10 billion, representing approximately 45% of the outstanding shares. Earlier today, we announced the new $1.2 billion share repurchase program, which we intend to complete by the end of January 2013. Please note that unlike our previous share repurchase programs, which were expressed as a number of shares to be repurchased, our new program is based on the total dollar amount to be spent on repurchases. We believe that this approach is more common in the marketplace and provides more certainty around the ultimate size of the program. Going forward, we intend to announce any future share repurchase programs on a similar basis. ","Before I turn it back to John, let me make a few additional comments regarding our 2012 guidance. We expect operating income per share for 2012 to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.70, which at the midpoint is $0.38 or 7% higher than our actual operating income per share for 2011. This guidance is based on our expectation that net written premium growth will be 2% to 4%. This assumes a negative 1% impact of foreign currency translation. We still have -- we will have a combined ratio of 93 to 95 for the year. Property and casualty investment income after tax will decline 3% to 5%. And finally, we're assuming 271 million average diluted shares outstanding for the year. Our guidance assumes 3.5 percentage points of catastrophe losses, the 2012 assumption is based on our long-term median annual cat loss of 3 percentage points, adjusted upward by 0.5 to reflect the higher catastrophe losses that we have experienced recently. ","In terms of sensitivity, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses in 2012 operating income per share is approximately $0.28. ","And now I'll turn it back to John.","John D. Finnegan","Thanks, Ricky. Chubb performed well in 2012. Net income was about $1.7 billion, generating an ROE of 10.7% which is outstanding considering that we had more than $1 billion in pretax catastrophe losses and a historically low interest rate environment. This performance was the direct result of our profitable risk strategy, careful risk reselection, disciplined pricing and conservative investing. ","Operating income per share was $5.12 despite a $2.30 per share impact of catastrophe losses. Operating ROE for the year was 10.4%. Our 2011 excellent year of cat combined ratio, which excludes prior period reserve development of catastrophes was a strong 93. Book value per share was up 9% for the full year. We continued to actively manage our capital by returning almost $2.2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And rates improved throughout the year in all 3 SBUs with average U.S. renewal increases standard commercial reaching 6% on the fourth quarter and with professional liability rates turn you from negative to positive. ","In summary, Chubb posted strong results in 2011 in the face of record catastrophe losses and a challenging macroeconomic and P&C industry environment. Looking ahead, our guidance is based on the view that 2012 should be a transition year for the industry. The good news is that the market continues to firm and we expect to see continued rate increases in 2012, which should improve industry margins albeit, on somewhat of a lagged basis that they earn out over time. On the other hand, the industry faces a number of offsetting profitability headwinds including low interest rates. In addition, most analysts foresee a decline in reserve releases for the industry from what have been a historically the high levels. The upshot is a combination of low reinvestment yields and less favorable development will continue to put pressure on the industry's reported 2012 calendar year results, even as insurance rates rise. However, if the current rate momentum continues as we expect it will. The industry should transition over the course of 2012 from margin contraction to margin expansion. At Chubb, we have strong capital position that enables us to return capital to shareholders and to take advantage of opportunities to grow profitably when such opportunities arise. While this is a cyclical industry, we think our superior underwriting, customer loyalty and conservative investing approach give us an edge that will enable us to continue to generate solid returns in whatever economic environment comes our way. ","And with that, I'd be glad to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you give us your perspective on the ability to push for faster rate increases in 2012 as we're getting 2 points of improvement on a linked quarter basis in 2011?","John D. Finnegan","What's the 2 points, Jay, you're talking out of improvement?","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, rate increases were flat in the First Quarter of 2011 and then they were up 2, 4, 6. Should we expect that pace to continue?","John D. Finnegan","I don't know about that, but I think we expect to have higher rate increases in all of 2012 than we have in the fourth quarter of 2011 on commercial. And we also have filed for rate increases in personal lines so that we will have higher rate increases in 2012 than 2011. And CSI, we're beginning to see some movement there. We're optimistic we'll see some rate improvement in 2012 but not the kind of levels that we see at CCI.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So accelerating rate improvement in '12 versus 11?","John D. Finnegan","In '12 versus '11 but I wouldn't sequentially extrapolate every -- out every quarter so you get the 14% on the fourth, we're not willing to say that.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That makes sense. And then on share buybacks, if you do roughly $1.2 billion in 2012, that would be down from $1.7 billion in 2011 and that $1.7 in 2011 matched up pretty well with net income for the year, so I was trying to get a sense why you think the pace of buyback should slow?","Richard G. Spiro","Sure. Well, the program we announced today is essentially in line. Actually, it slightly exceeds our projected 2012 earnings less shareholder dividend. We do not project out net income as part of our guidance. So operating income and net income are essentially the same in our guidance. And as such, we believe that it's a sizable program which appropriately balances the economic opportunities, the market with the retention of strong capital position. I think I'd also add in 2011, the size of our share repurchase was unusually large and that our share repurchase as you mentioned, did exceed net income less shareholder dividend by a fair amount and as we indicated at the time, we announced that program. The large size of the program was an opportunistic initiative prompted by historically low price-to-book value, which Chubb was then selling. So over the past year, the price of Chubb stock has risen and our price-to-book valuation has increased. On the other hand, our price-to-book valuation still remains below historical levels and interest rates are still very low, making alternative investments less attractive. Balancing all these considerations, we believe the appropriate level of buyback for 2012 is the $1.2 billion that we announced and it reflects our continued strong excess capital position and the attractive economic opportunities that we still perceive at our current stock price.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is there opportunity to increase the authorization if profits come in faster than what you're projecting?","Richard G. Spiro","We're not going to make any comments about future buybacks or any changes to the program at this point.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Obviously, impressive performance in CCI in the quarter, the question -- the big question in my mind is does it -- you guys were able to increase pricing and units or at least, hold units flattish. I'm wondering how you characterize that dynamic in the market sort of what's allowing you to do that? Whether we should take that a sign as if like a class card market or for something else? And separately, there's clearly a disconnect in the D&O and professional liability market where you're trying to take pricing up but the market isn't letting you and you've taken written premiums down in your business to lost ratio. It sounds like it has come down pretty meaningfully, quarter-over-quarter and I'm wondering if you can talk about perhaps the different dynamic going on there?","Paul J. Krump","I think I'm following that Josh, it seems like there are a lot of questions kind of intertwined there. Clearly in the CSI world, there is more overall competition than we're seeing in the CCI arena. Particularly, from some new entrants, some people trying to take some excess positions and what we are doing is we're pushing rates very hard albeit, the 1% doesn't show it. I think you sense it when you see that our retention rate went down quarter-over-quarter from 89% to 85% in professional liability. Likewise, when you see the emphasis that we're putting on new business, the scrutiny that we're putting on new business in both CCI and CSI it's coming through. The stat that I gave in the prepared remarks was that professional liability had a new to lost ratio of 0.7:1 versus the 1.3:1. So we are anticipating on a go forward basis that we will push rates very hard and that there is an offset trade to retention and we're very mindful that new business does not perform as well as our renewal business does traditionally and therefore, we're putting a lot of extra scrutiny onto that new business in this marketplace.","John D. Finnegan","And perhaps, Paul, you also had a question on CCI so maybe you want to contrast that a little.","Paul J. Krump","Yes. In CCI, we had retention of 85% in both quarters. We had a very minor uptick in the new business in the fourth quarter. And the rates really varied, as I mentioned, by line of business. But we're putting a tremendous amount of effort into the new business. I think you can see in the numbers that we had some loss activity on non-cat basis and property and Marine. And we went back and analyzed that very carefully, and we had an uptick in the fourth quarter and losses from some new business that was written over the course of the last year. So again, it just reemphasized to us a couple of things. We need to push a lot of rate into that book of business and that's why in fact, you saw us take 10 points of rate. Likewise, we have to put a lot of scrutiny on the new business and we've tightened up our underwriting screens and our pricing screens to make certain that, that is taken care of.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","If I could just ask one follow up on the CSI and I know you guys don't want to speculate about competitors, but would you presume that other -- that the market is generally sort of looking forward and sort of thinking about the loss ratio at the levels that you guys are recognizing that you've now taken some charges to take up the axe in your 2011 view in professional liability. Is that just something that maybe isn't -- that's driving the competition, people haven't yet figured that out?","Paul J. Krump","We certainly think that we've got decades of data and experience here. We're hearing a lot more rhetoric in the marketplace about other senior management teams taking a hard look at this issue that you've outlined. Sometimes, we see that translate into field action really quickly but overall, I think that we are encouraged by the trends that we saw and the momentum we saw across both CCI and CSI in the fourth quarter. Clearly, John outlined and we're all in agreement here that CSI needs a lot more rate and we are committed to keep pushing that.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","You mentioned a lot more rate, I think I would love if you had any color on sort of by line, which you guys think, sort of reasonable rate targets for the industry would be?","Paul J. Krump","I'll just stick with professional for a second. The 1% that we've got as we turned the corner but that's clearly not enough to keep up with loss trends.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Keith Walsh with Citi.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just first on the net written premium guidance, why only 2% to 4%? I know you mentioned FX but if you're getting positive rates, not only positive rate but broader rate gains, what are the exposure assumptions within that guidance? It seems conservative and I've got a follow-up.","Richard G. Spiro","Keith, it's Ricky. Let me -- first of all, we are certainly expecting given the commentary that you've heard this evening that the market's going to continue to firm and we hope to realize potentially higher rate increases in 2012. I'd like to point out that there are a number of factors as you rightly mentioned that contribute to our overall projections. So first, let me put it in our premium growth in perspective and you mentioned FX, that's part of it. Since about a quarter of our business comes from outside of the United States, currency movements have a meaningful impact on our growth and 2011 currency fluctuations had a positive impact on our overall premium growth of about 1 point and in contrast, as I just mentioned, our guidance assumes that will have a negative effect on growth of about 1 point in 2012. So if you look at it on x currency basis, we're expecting premium growth of 3% to 5% in 2012 compared to about 4% in '11 therefore in an x currency basis, we expect about the same level of growth in 2012 with in 2011. With that as background, the next question that you'd asked is why aren't we expecting to see more growth in 2012 given the higher rate environment? And I think to answer that question, several interrelated factors need to be understood. First, while we do expect to get a couple of points of higher rate increases in 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, these rate increases vary significantly by line of business and geography. So for example, in the fourth quarter, Paul mentioned that we achieved mid- single-digit rate increases in our standard commercial book in the U.S. but only flat rate increases in CCI in Europe. In addition, we probably averaged about 1 point of rate in our other 2 businesses in the U.S. So when you put all of the pieces together on a global basis, our total rate increase in the fourth quarter was probably closer to 2 points. So you can't just focus on the U.S. when you consider our worldwide growth rate. Second, as Paul just mentioned, as we continue to push for rate, we expect some trade-off between retention and new business levels in 2012 and we've taken this into account in our guidance. We are aggressively attempting to improve the profitability of our book through a combination of renewal rate increases and the calling of accounts and this will likely result in lower retention from the retention rates we ran in 2011 and this is a function of the market remaining competitive, very competitive especially with respect to professional liability and an ongoing effort on our part to trim or least profitable accounts. A similar and perhaps even more pronounced impact on our growth rate will most likely be seeing the amount of new business. Since this is traditionally less profitable business than renewals, we're going to be especially disciplined in terms of achieving our target returns and we're going to be very selective in terms of the new business that we're willing to write. We believe that these trade-offs make economic sense but it will dampen our growth in 2012. So hopefully that answers your question, Keith?","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, very, very helpful. And just a follow up on -- you touched on this earlier, but on CCI, you guys are getting good rate and you got excellent retention, probably better than most of the people in the industry. The question then I would ask would -- should you be getting more rate then? Is retention too high here? Can you talk about the philosophy here between retention and rate, understanding you managed to the bottom line, of course, for earnings?","John D. Finnegan","We try to get more rate each quarter. We test out the market and see what the market will accept, if the market continues to accept higher rate at similar retention levels. We'll definitely keep pushing. Our retention was off 2 points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. You're looking year-over-year, but we have a couple of point decline. But sure, it encourages us to look for more rate. Yes.","Operator","Now we'll take our next question from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you give some color and maybe quantify the pension impact you touched on in the prepared remarks and I'll have a follow up.","Richard G. Spiro","The impact is about a negative $250 million impact in the fourth quarter related to the fact that as interest rates have moved down during the year. We had to lower our discount rate assumption for our pension fund. And as a result, we had roughly a $250 million negative impact. You'll see that show up when we file our year-end financials that will show up in the AOCI line.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So would that be roughly -- you lowered discount rate by over a full percent?","Richard G. Spiro","No. We lowered it by about 75 basis points.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And lastly, can you talk about workers comp profitability, any trends including reserve trends?","Paul J. Krump","Sure. Let me just kind of back up and put our workers comp in a little bit of perspective just given where we see. There's a lot of commentary in the marketplace and we're very much of a niche player, and it's not an overwhelming line for us like it is for a lot of carriers. We took 6 points of rate increase in the fourth quarter on our workers compensation book. Like we mentioned, with the overall book that was an improving trajectory over the course of the year, we've got a very solid book of workers compensation business. AM Best projects that the U.S. work comp industry will come in for the full-year 2011 at 121.5% combined ratio. That's really such a stark contrast of the 93.2% combined that we ran our workers compensation at in 2011. Dino, I don't know if you want to mention anything on the reserves in particular? But...","Dino E. Robusto","Well, I can talk a little bit about just the frequency of what we saw. I mean, just to pick up on Paul's point. Because it's only 2% market share, obviously our claim statistics is not be as stable as the industry. For the quarter, where comp new rising claim counts were up about 13%, mostly due to the increased volume of business that we've been writing. Increase in the quarter was also driven by medical-only claims, which are significantly less expensive than claims where the employees miss time from work. So that's a little bit on just the activity that we're seeing.","Richard G. Spiro","And if I can add something on the reserve side, the workers comp line actually updated slightly favorable overall, with no individual years particularly significant either way, although 2010 was very slightly adverse. So we feel pretty good about it.","Operator","And we'll go next to Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wanted to just get a better sense on the margin trajectory? So I think in that -- the commentary you mentioned that you do expect margins to begin to improve by the end of the year. I'm trying to tie that comment to guidance, which is, it's almost impossible to get to your guidance unless we assume pretty significant deterioration in margins all year long. So how should we be tying and improving margin against a 9-ROE guidance?","John D. Finnegan","Well, just to your last statement, Greg, our guidance implies about 4 points, so deterioration on our x cat combined ratio and that could come from a combination of lower favorable development and\/or deteriorating accident year results. It could come from a combination of that. It's not based on a 4-point deterioration necessarily in accident results. But our margin, I think the margin issue it's complicated and the waters are often muddy. It's 2 points here. Are you getting more rate than your loss cost trends? And second, is there margin expansion in the accident year, which is a traditional profitability measure? And they are 2 different things. But let's walk through. Why don't we try a couple of different lines, but the one that you -- most people focus on is commercial because that's we're getting the rate improvement. ","6% in the fourth quarter, 4% in the third, 2% in the second. To ask about where they get margin expansion, it's a difficult question because to answer with great position, it's a function of the accuracy of the assumptions related to future rates from loss trends. So let's take one loss trend benchmark, 2005 to 2010. Tremendously benign. Very low single-digit range. So that we always had no margin contraction despite the fact that rates were going down a point and a half a year. Now fourth quarter 2011, increased renewal rates of 6%. Man, they compared very favorably to those 2005 to 2010 loss rates. So, if like others, you may simplify the assumption that those like benign loss rates will continue into 2012, significant [indiscernible] expansion will occur very quickly at the current level of rate increases. ","On the other hand, it's probably fair to say that we will in some time experience the reverse of the more historical loss trend, as an area which is embedded in our budgeting process. In such a longer-term basis, the historical loss trends probably run in the low mid single-digit range, 3%, 4%, 5%. Thus if we were to see reversions to these higher loss cost trends this year, near-term margin expansion would be less at current rate levels. However, we expect the market to continue to firm and high single-digit rate increases in such CCI in the U.S. in 2012. If this proves accurate, rate increases would exceed even longer-term loss cost trends, such that we'd be experiencing significant pro forma economic margin expansion on the premiums written in CCI in 2012. So that's the business we write. If we get high single-digit increases under most scenarios, we should be getting rate increases that exceed loss trends. Now that requires again what you assume for the rate, and what you assume for the losses, but then you got to move the profit. You realize that this margin expansion does not flow through immediately to increase earnings. Rather, these rate increases are reflected in results only as they are earned out in the term for the underlying contract. That is over the next 4 to 5 quarters. Just to illustrate the point, our 2012 accident year results will be a function of the rates achieved in contracts entered into for the beginning of 2011 through the end of 2012. Our renewal rate increases averaged about 3% in 2011. Quarter [indiscernible]  Achieved high single-digit rate increases in 2012 in our U.S. renewal book. The increase in our earned premium on our overall 2012 U.S. business would be about 5% to 6%, and closer to 4% to 5% on a worldwide basis, with the additional 3 points or so being recognized in earnings in 2013. So now, if you're at 4% to 5%, is it higher than loss trends? Well, it depends which loss trends you assume. But in 2012, I don't think you can look at significant margin expansion unless you believe we're going back to the 2005 to '10 benign environment. But I think that the continued rate increases and the range we are currently experiencing are going to [indiscernible] through longer-term margin expansion for CCI, but the magnitude of such expansion depended upon loss experienced with the size of rate increases next year. Because of the lag impact in our premium, however, the effect in our 2012 accident year results is likely be closer neutral. However, continued premium increases in the mid to high single-digits over the next year or 2 should result in significant margin expansion as we move into 2013. Now, having said all that, losses in any given year are rarely in line with the trends. So, for example, over the last few years, we've incurred significant amount of non-cat-related with the losses. Accordingly, it was difficult to forecast this stuff with any absolute precision. But there are a lot of variables involved, so I think momentum is moving it right way in CCI, but I think to some degree, some people are ahead of themselves in terms of how that's going to translate into improved earnings and margin expansion in your financial results in 2012. And our other 2 lines, CPI, we should see -- again we'd be obtaining rates for the end 2012 that will be exceeding any loss cost trends, but premium, probably closer again to neutral. CSI, probably it will be a challenge to get up to a loss cost trends so we could see some pressure on our accident year 2012 business versus 2011.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And one thing, and you mentioned at the outset and certainly we do understand that reserve releases are components, that is very hard to call but I guess implicit in your answer is it's all about the core margin, that you don't see a break in the trend in terms of the way Chubb has been reserving and what's coming through for that line item?","John D. Finnegan","We don't project favorable development. We do it under a number of scenarios but I'd say this: 2 statements; one to the positive and maybe one to the negative. But the most scenario, the achievement of our 2012 guidance would require a continuation of some favorable development, albeit at lower levels than we ran in 2011. And as I said in the past few years, and have been proven wrong, it's hard to believe we can sustain 6 to 7 points of favorable development indefinitely.","Operator","And we'll go next to Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","First question is on the margins. I'm looking at the accident year margins x cat and the loss ratio x cat. And that's up around 5.4% of fourth quarter this year over fourth quarter last year. And it seems to be coming from the Commercial lines and from the Personal lines. Just wondering what's happening in that?","John D. Finnegan","You're right. It's up 5 points in the fourth quarter of '10. It's coming from a mix business at 4 points in CPI of which about 3.5 points is due to higher homeowners non-cat weather-related losses, 5 points in CCI, driven by double-digit increase in property marine and modest increase in other classes. We had a significant large loss activity in the fourth quarter in property. And CCI has generally experienced some margin compression taking place before we've turned around rates. For the year, CCI is about 3 points higher than 2010. And about 6.5% increase in CSI reflected an increase in professional liability mainly to deterioration in current accident year estimates for crime, EPL and public D&O, especially as it relates to merger objections suits or M&A objections suits based on our year-end analysis. For the full accident year, CSI's is up about 2 points.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So do you think that some part of the higher losses both in CPI and CSI are sort of one-time because of higher non-cat losses or do you expect that to continue next year?","John D. Finnegan","I would say that in CPI, that higher non-cat losses are something that hopefully don't recur. So we take some solace that we don't expect it to recur next year. I don't think we're really talking attributing much of the increase in CCI at a higher non-cat losses. I mean it may be a point or 2 in there but really it's some property marine, it's a lumpy class and we had some big losses in the fourth quarter. I don't think that's an ongoing trend. I could be proved wrong, but don't think it's an ongoing trend. But CCI is a good news. Of course, as we talked about it that we're getting -- there's rate increases in CCI so hopefully, it will offset any deterioration we're seeing here. CSI is more challenging. I mean I don't think 2 bad quarters don't make a trend, but losses have been up. Now Losses have been up in areas which are impacted by the economy. The good news is, no adverse development on the credit crisis or Madoff, but the areas that are affected by the economic downturn, employment practices liability, crime and fidelity, ponzi schemes related, fraud, and then public D&O as they say based on a lot of these merger objection suits. So we need some rate in CSI. Okay, I'll just leave it at that.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","My second question was on the personal order line. You've seen about 7% to 11% topline growth there. What happened this quarter and what do you think it's going to happen for '12?","Dino E. Robusto","Yes. We experienced some slowdown in our written premium growth outside the United States and it was mainly in Brazil. We had seen some more aggressive pricing in the market, some of which we view as irrational and probably likely short-lived given the short tailed nature in what is a real physical damage intensive market. We also experienced a little less favorable currency translation in the fourth quarter in relation to the full 2011 year. Now, notwithstanding the quarter's results, we did grow 7% for the year. So at any one point in time in auto, we're going to see in any one geography some additional competition or if we view it as irrational competition, then we'll just pull back and we'll let it play out. And so that's what we did in the fourth quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Do you have any thoughts on accelerating loss trends from third quarter to fourth quarter, what you're seeing throughout your book of business?","Richard G. Spiro","I'll give you just a general comment on claim trends overall. Actually, they generally, they've been consistent with our trend assumptions. And if you exclude catastrophes, claim counts are up about 8% against the prior-year quarter and for the full year. Given our growth in various lines of business and really the non-spade of non-cat weather activities throughout the year that John mentioned, really the frequency trend is not alarming. Regarding severity, the trends obviously, they vary significantly by line of business because the various lines of business have different cost drivers. But here again, our claim cost severity increase are generally consistent with our longer-term trend assumptions of low to mid-single digits of severity increase in auto, mid-single-digit for the core property in general liability and mid up or single-digit for work comp and some excess lines. But generally in line with our longer-term trends.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. On the professional liability book, can you talk about accident year development for the last few accident years, kind of where have those picks ended the year and how much of the current year pick is due to some of the items that you discussed in your commentary. I just have one follow up.","John D. Finnegan","Well, if you're talking about professional liability development in County in 2011. We had very positive professional liability development mostly from the accident year in 2006 or 2008. 2009 was relatively flat. 2010 was modestly adverse.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then for the current year, your -- looks like the accident year combined is some 90 -- looks about 98, I think that's right. How much of that is due to the items that you discussed in your commentary? So the lumpier losses related to recent credit in other events?","John D. Finnegan","That's not related to credit crisis. I mean that was developed very consistently. It's really -- it's tangential, although it's related to the economic crisis that might have flown out of that credit crisis with the economic downturn. Employment practices liability to expect with people out of work longer. That's up. Is it lumpy? Well, it's been with us a little while longer. I mean, unless the economy turns around. Crime and fidelity, with frauds and things, I'd say on that, that it's decreased but not as positively as our expectations were. But it's declined some. And not all of the stuff occurred in the fourth quarter. This business in the fourth quarter, you get a good fresh look at the reserves for the year and some of this isn't attributable all to the fourth quarter. It's an adjustment, the overall accident year takes place in the fourth quarter though. So we'll have to see whether it's a trend or not. I'll just remind people that we had incredibly benign loss trends for a long period of time, maybe 1%. It's not likely to continue, and in fact, it certainly is likely to continue if you're expecting mid to single-digit, high single-digit rate increases. They don't usually de-link like that.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You mentioned Europe before, can you talk a little bit about how much of your book is Europe by segment and what are you anticipating from a pricing retention, new business standpoint as far as business out of Europe?","Paul J. Krump","Sure, this is Paul. I think we've talked about this in the past but about 26%, 27% of our book premium is generated outside the United States. That's a pretty even split across all 3 SBU's. So give or take a percentage point. As respect to where that business comes from, about 10 points of that 27 points is coming out of Europe, and then you can just take the remaining chunk and divide it by thirds and it's pretty evenly split between Canada, Latin America and Asia Pacific. As I mentioned, Canada is a little bit behind the United States, but we saw a nice pick up there, really across the CCI lines. A lot of moving parts over in Asia, quite frankly in New Zealand and Australia are moving. Australia is where we have the bulk of our Asia-Pac business. When you get down into Latin America, we saw a lot of movement earlier in the year, in Chile. And in fact over the last 2 renewal cycles given the last earthquake, we had rate increases on our small property book of business. But nonetheless, they went up over 100%. The other countries in Latin America are basically flat to up a little bit.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Flavor of the European rate environment?","Paul J. Krump","Yes, flavor of the European rate environment. It's a better market for us in the U.K., in Ireland. We're starting to see some rate movement out of our Lloyd's syndicate. That's probably leading our European operations. The continent is flat. We saw a terrific amount of competition in the continent for the largest business. So the so-called risk management business came under more pressure in the fourth quarter, and we had to back away from several accounts, long-standing accounts just because the prices were going down. And we wouldn't follow them down.","Operator","Now we'll take our next question from Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just real quick, a sort of follow up. Where is the development on the CCI? Is that more recent years or older years?","John D. Finnegan","Well, I'll give you this, the development overall, most of the favorable development in casualty in 2011 came from accident years 2005 to 2008. Accident years -- maybe put together 2009 and 2010 they aggregate slightly positively. CCI about the same, you think? I think generally CCI is so big that you wouldn't go, it wouldn't contradict that. It probably is generally consistent but not precisely. Those your CCI's had a lot of positive development.","Paul J. Krump","Coming out of the umbrella line.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And just one quick follow up, the loss ratio moving up in the casualty line, which products are, I guess, are doing worse than others?","John D. Finnegan","Loss ratio estimate. What number are you looking at, I'm sure that's different.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I'll check my numbers in the back.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, just with respect to the rate increases you're getting, is there any response from customers yet in terms of either changing deductibles or limits versus or anything that would signal to you that your kind of ability to push prices is limited at this point?","Paul J. Krump","Matthew, this is Paul. We're really not seeing that. A lot of the producers worry, of course, that the economy is still on a fragile state, but as we push for rate, they clearly understand the economic case for rate. But they worry that their clients will buy less umbrella or take an inordinately large deductible to try to keep their costs under control. But we haven't really experienced that.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just for Ricky, I appreciate the comments you made in your intro with respect to the buybacks, but I guess one thing that strikes me is, is in fact fundamentals keep getting better and we kind of trough out at kind of the current earnings levels on accident base notwithstanding the fact that interest rates are still headwind. The current dividend payout is only about 30%, which from a trough earnings perspective seems awfully low to me. So with respect to your thoughts on capital allocation next year, is there any weight being given to the dividend?","Richard G. Spiro","Our dividend policy has always been that we think dividends are incredibly important and as you know we've increased that every year, I think for 29 years. When we next talk to our Board about dividends will consider are all the factors. I think, I don't think you should expect, though, that you're going to see our dividend payout increase dramatically. It's been relatively consistent and we don't always look at it, by the way, as a percent of earnings because earnings as you know in this business can be volatile so we often look at it as a percent, for example, of investment income and other financial measures as well. So I don't know that you should anticipate that you'll see a dramatic increase than payout ratio.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess I wanted to focus a little bit on the CSI business because that seems the one area where there's been one of a share from a claim standpoint and annual response to the pressures there. And I'm wondering, how you're approaching that market? Are there, for example, particular lines of business we are mandating rate increases? What's your main message to your underwriters in the field?","Richard G. Spiro","I think it's probably easiest to, Jay, if we take it line by line. We mentioned employment practices liability. I think John laid a pretty understandable case with the increase in unemployment and a lot of people saying much longer from their jobs that we're seeing an uptick there. So what we're doing is we are trimming our book in the most difficult jurisdictions, we're pushing rate across the book and we're raising our deductibles. When it comes to fidelity, it is a lumpy business, but we see the economic backdrop impacting that book of business. So we're redoubling our efforts on the underwriting just making certain we have people being very careful about what is going on the book of business. As respects public D&O, and I'd just like to remind you that that's only 16% of our CSI book of business, we are concerned, as mentioned earlier, about merger and acquisition objection cases. At this point, we don't sit back and say that's a systemic event something like the Madoff situation. So it's something that we think we've got a build in to the overall pricing of our business and push deductibles higher at least on our private companies where you're seeing some securities actions in state court impacting the loss ratio. So it really varies by line and we're attacking it as aggressively as we can.","Operator","And we'll go to our next caller, Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","It seems a little atypical to me that we're seeing the standard Commercial lines harden faster than the Specialty lines just in contrast in historical precedent. I've been wondering whether that suggests there's just a knee-jerk reaction to bad weather or catastrophic losses and that's maybe less sustainable or do think that sooner or later we're going to have an even bigger reaction in the Professional lines?","John D. Finnegan","Hopefully the latter. I think that some of these lines like EPL you can safely say that all companies are being hit by the increases in these loss costs and people are going to have to get rate increases. Public D&O has been down so much. It's definitely going to new rate increases. There's going to be a great demand for increases. Now there is excess capacity so there's a tension there. But no, I think that people will be reporting incredibly high combined ratios if they don't get rates soon.","Operator","And we'll go next to Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","You're talking a lot about renewal pricing. I'm just wondering if you can go back to the new and renewal pricing Delta especially in CCI. And do you think that the gap has diminished meaningfully or you're still foresee some gap for 2012?","Richard G. Spiro","Well if I'm following it, the new to lost ratio was 1.1:1 in the fourth quarter. It came down a little bit throughout the year and we anticipate that coming down a little bit. But if you're talking about the pricing spread between new commercial business and renewal business, couple of thoughts, number one, the spread between new lines and the renewals is closing although it really wasn't all that large to begin with. The spread, obviously, depends on the line of business but what we do is we sit back and we try to match up what the new business is coming on at, what rate it\u2019s at and how does that match up with a very similar existing block of customers. In some lines, we look at that on manual pricing, for others we actually have proprietary tools but we try to make certain that it is as tight as possible. The reality is, though that there is a hindsight bias to renewals performing much better. We have an opportunity to call the ones that are having unforeseen losses, likewise, we have the opportunity to loss control accounts and bring in engineers and risk mitigation factors happening, raise deductibles, that type of things. So even though that pricing spread is tight and getting tighter, we're still very mindful on how we underwrite the new business.","John D. Finnegan","Operator, we'll take 2 more calls.","Operator","At this time, we have one question remaining. That's from Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman","One question on professional liability and one for Ricky. On the PL, I noticed the pays really spiked this quarter, and I think that it's been a little bit higher than trend all year. Is that -- I guess I'm wondering is the increase pick due to something you're seeing on the quayside or is it being driven by the paid side or is it a combination of both?","John D. Finnegan","Well, the pay was up, I think the paids are one of the things that the actuaries take into account when they look at the reserve position.","Ian Gutterman","Are the paids more related to like the credit crisis claims finally getting paid out or just sort of a spike in the first-year paids?","John D. Finnegan","I wouldn't say a spike in first-year paids. Professional liability.","Paul J. Krump","And then CSI, it really was just a number of large old cases we resolved.","John D. Finnegan","It takes a long time, obviously, to pay out a lot of these cases so many of them are from prior years.","Ian Gutterman","And then Ricky, I guess first on NII, given the FED action yesterday that we're going to have short rates for even longer, can you remind us where your new money is versus portfolio yield and sort of how long it is before we hit breakeven on that?","Richard G. Spiro","We have roughly called $14 billion of maturities over the next 3 years. I think that's not split evenly but it's pretty close. Our current new money rates are anywhere depending on obviously, the different asset classes somewhere between, call it, 100 and 150 basis points below the maturing book yields.","Ian Gutterman","And so even within 3 years assuming new money stays here through 14 like the FED says, the portfolio yield will still be above today's new money?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes. I think so because we\u2019re only, we have roughly $14 billion out of $36 billion maturing over that time.","Ian Gutterman","And then can you just --","Richard G. Spiro","I'm have done the break even after where you asked it.","Steve R. Labbe - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","The reason I thought is maybe it would be closer because obviously, 3 to 4 year duration in 3 years if rates aren't moved, that you should've gotten there but it sounds like maybe it takes longer.","Richard G. Spiro","Well, one thing to think that, that is the duration of the portfolio but we also on the Muni site, we tend to invest longer than that. So the duration of whole the portfolio is obviously, the 3.5 to 4 years. But the Muni piece is a little bit longer.","Ian Gutterman","Okay. And then why didn't you refinance the debt.  Are you looking towards a different cat target than before? Do you just not need the capital?","Richard G. Spiro","We simply need the capital. So we decided it was -- we were better off paying down the debt and given ourselves some more financial flexibility and terms of our targeted debt to capital ratio, they're still within the same ranges that we talked about.","Steve R. Labbe - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And target holding company? That $2 billion in cash. What can that go down to over time?","Richard G. Spiro","We're committed to keeping $1 billion at the holding company so that sort of, I guess, the low end of the number.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Finnegan for any additional or closing remarks.","John D. Finnegan","Okay. Thank you very much.

Good day, and welcome to the Chubb Limited Fourth Quarter Year-End 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Karen Beyer","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Chubb's December 31st, 2019 fourth quarter year-end earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance and growth opportunities, pricing and business mix and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially.","Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.","Now it's my pleasure to introduce our speakers this morning. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer, we'll then take your questions. Also with us to assist you with your questions are several members of our management team.","And now I will turn the call over to Evan.","Evan Greenberg","Good morning.","As you saw from the numbers, we recorded core operating income in the fourth quarter of $2.28 per share, up 13% from prior year. The quarter was marked by excellent premium revenue growth globally, driven by an improved and improving pricing and underwriting environment, that is spreading to more lines of business and more territories.","Our organic growth in the commercial lines underwriting environment were the best in over five years. We also experienced a fairly active quarter globally for weather-related and man-made catastrophes, including the impact of weather on our U.S. agriculture business.","Core operating income was just over $1 billion. Our published P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 92.7%, about 0.5% point improvement over prior year, with P&C underwriting income up 12%.","On the one hand, we benefited from lower year-over-year catastrophe losses. You may have noticed that half of our total CAT losses in the quarter was from one event at Tornado that destroyed a mile by 1.5 mile affluent neighborhood in the suburbs of Dallas, where Chubb had significant market share, what are the odds, but that's our business.","On the other hand, as you saw from our pre-announcement, we reported an underwriting loss of $23 million for the quarter in our crop insurance business, attributable to yield shortfalls from difficult growing conditions compared with an underwriting gain of $161 million in last year's fourth quarter.","As I pointed out before, by its nature, crop insurance is a business with CAT like exposures. After all, it's about moisture and temperature i.e., the weather. The risk-reward for crop insurance has been favorable for Chubb over the long, short and medium term. And after three exceptional years in '16 to '18, last year was below average.","For the quarter, the global P&C combined ratio, which excludes agriculture was 91.9% compared with 95.2% prior year. And on a current accident year basis, excluding CATs, it was an outstanding, 88.6% versus 89.9% last year. To briefly recap the year, core operating earnings of $4.6 billion were up over 5%.","The P&C underwriting income, up 4.5%. Global P&C underwriting income, which again excludes Ag, was up 18.5%. The Global P&C combined ratios both calendar and current accident year were simply excellent. The calendar year was down from the year before, and the current accident year, excluding CATs was flat with prior year.","Booking tangible book value per share were up 11.7% and 18.6%, respectively for the year, driven by a combination of income and the mark from falling interest rates. Phil will have more to say about the investment income, book value, CATs and prior period development.","Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premium revenue in the quarter in constant dollars was excellent. And as I noted a moment ago, the strongest organic premium revenue growth in over five years.","Net premiums grew 9.8% before foreign exchange, which had less than 1 point of negative impact. The pricing environment continued to improve quarter-on-quarter with the rate of increase accelerating and spreading to more classes of business and risk types.","Overall, prices increased in North America, commercial, which includes both major accounts and specialty, as well as middle market and small commercial by 8.3% on a written basis versus a current loss cost trend of about 4.5%. Renewal price change includes both rate of 9%, and a slight decline on exposure of about 0.5%.","We continue to benefit from a flight to quality, more business continues to meet our underwriting standards and new and existing customers choose Chubb. New business was up nearly 10% in the quarter and renewal retention was excellent, 95.5% on a premium and 87% on a policy count basis.","In major accounts and specialty commercial, excluding ag, premiums grew over 10.5%, with major accounts retail growth of 9% and E&S wholesale growth of 10%. In terms of rate increases: rates for major accounts were up 10.5%; with risk management, up 5.5%; excess casualty, up 27%; and property and short-tail lines, up 20%. Management liability rates increased 20%.","In our Westchester, E&S wholesale business, rates were up 15%; property, up over 19%; casualty, up 15%; and financial lines, up nearly 12%, all well above third quarter's increases. Rates in our Chubb Bermuda business were up 33%.","Turning to our U.S. middle market and small commercial division, premiums grew over 7.5%, and excluding workers comp, we grew 10%. Renewal retention in our middle market business was nearly 94%. Middle market pricing was up 5%, and excluding comp, it was up nearly 7%. Pricing for casualty ex. comp was up about 6%, while comp pricing was down about 4.5%. Package was up 6%; property, up 10.5%; and financial lines rates were up almost 8%.","In our North America, personal lines business, net premiums in the quarter were up over 9%, but adjusted for additional reinsurance items, which negatively impacted prior year growth, we grew 4.5%. Retention remains strong at 97.5% on a premium basis, and over 89% on a policy basis. Homeowners pricing was up nearly 13% in the quarter. We are making great progress in reshaping the portfolio, the more closely focused on clients, who lead our risk profile.","Turning to our international business, growth remains strong in our Overseas General Insurance operations with premiums written, up 9% in constant dollars and FX then had a negative impact about 2.5 percentage points. Net premiums for our London market wholesale business were up 22%, while our retail division was up almost 8% with growth broadly distributed across the globe.","Growth in our international retail was led by Continental Europe, up nearly 10.5% and the best growth in many years, followed by Latin America and Asia Pac, up over 9% and 8%, respectively, and the U.K., up over 5.5%.","Overall, rates in our international retail business were up 10%; property, up 11%; casualty, up 3%; and financial lines, up 17%. Rates in our London wholesale business were up 20%; property, up 21%; financial lines, up 16%; and aviation, up 27%.","Our Asia-focused international Life Insurance business had a strong quarter with net premiums, up over 14% in constant dollar and a contribution to earnings of $36 million, up over 12% from prior year. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Luis Ortega can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends.","In closing, it was a good quarter and year for Chubb. Premium revenue growth continued to accelerate as more business meets our underwriting standards and we achieve greater price adequacy and a rapidly improving underwriting environment. We have started the New Year in excellent shape with a lot of momentum.","Our organization was built on a global scale to capitalize on market conditions, such as this. We have patiently waited and remain disciplined and true to our culture and the craft of underwriting excellence. We are now capitalizing on greater opportunity.","At the same time, we are not taking our eye off the execution of our many important long-term strategic initiatives, that position us for future revenue and earnings growth, including our increasing ownership stake in Huatai Insurance Group, progress we are making with our digital efforts, our growing international consumer lines operation and our growth strategies for middle market and small commercial around the globe.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we'll be back to take your questions.","Philip Bancroft","Thank you, Evan.","We completed the year with a very strong overall financial position. Businesses and investment performance produced positive cash flow of $1.4 billion for the quarter and $6.3 billion for the year. Our total capital grew to over $70 billion and our cash and invested assets grew $8.6 billion for the year, to $111 billion.","In addition, as Evan mentioned our book and tangible book value per share were 11.7% and 18.6%, respectively. For the year, excluding unrealized gains from declining interest rates book and tangible book value per share grew 5.5% and 8.1%, respectively.","Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $650 million to shareholders, including $340 million in dividends and $310 million in share repurchases. For the year, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders, including $1.4 billion in dividends and over $1.5 billion in share repurchases at an average price of $146.61 per share.","In December, we issued $1.6 billion of five-year and 10-year debt in the European market at an average interest rate of 0.59%. For the year, we have issued $2.8 billion of euro debt and paid out of $500 million of debt that mature. This debt produced to fund certain future debt maturities and other corporate uses.","Our annualized core operating ROE for the year was 9% and our core operating return on tangible equity was 14.6%. As previously announced in December, we increased our ownership stake in Huatai Insurance Group to 30.9% and agreed to purchase another 22.4% in two separate transactions, contingent on certain approvals and other conditions. We will hold a majority stake when we complete the second transaction. Until then, we continue to apply equity accounting to our Huatai ownership.","Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $893 million pretax and $3.6 billion pretax for the year. The investment income in the quarter was slightly below our previous guidance due to lower than expected private equity distributions.","While there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we now expect our quarterly run rate to be in the range of $885 million to $895 million. After-tax net realized and unrealized gains were $268 million for the quarter and $3 billion for the year, primarily from a decline in interest rates in the fixed income portfolio.","Net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $430 million pretax, or $350 million after-tax, as previously announced and are further detailed in the financial supplement. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $233 million pretax, or $199 million after-tax.","This is net of $74 million adverse development from our legacy run off exposure principally related to asbestos. The remaining favorable development of $307 million is split approximately 67% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2015 and prior and 33% in short-tail lines.","The full year agriculture combined ratio was 95.1%, compared with 75.5% in the prior year, or a decline of $296 million in underwriting income from higher crop losses. Given this year's results, we do not expect the 2019 crop year to develop anywhere near as favorably in 2020, as the 2018 year developed in the first quarter of 2019. As a reminder, we had positive development of over $60 million in last year's first quarter.","On a constant dollar basis, net loss reserves decreased $118 million in the quarter, reflecting the impact of catastrophe loss statements, favorable prior period development and crop insurance payments in the quarter. On a reported basis, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 106%.","After adjusting for the items noted above, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 98%. For the year, net loss reserves increased $514 million on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, the paid-to-incurred ratio for the year was 99% and was 92% adjusted for the items noted above.","Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%, which is in line with our annual expected range, although, is there at the lower end of the range given the impact of catastrophe losses in the quarter. For the year, our core operating effective tax rate was 14.9%. For 2020, we expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to continue to be in the range of 14% to 16%.","I'll turn the call back to - I mean, Karen, sorry.","Karen Beyer","Thank you. And at this point, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will begin with Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Phillips","I guess, first question, Evan, very high-level question and then kind of apologize in advance. It's kind of a generic question, but I really want to get your thoughts on this. Look, the industry is reacting to, I guess, listening to the past, if you will from pricing and its to the industry. You seem, we don't have to do those much because your prior year stuff was already strong. And so the question here is kind of more, how do you think about - the answer is really your account by account details of your underwriting, and which you guys do phenomenally well.","But at a high-level, Evan, how do you steer the ship with thinking about just the trade-off between - you have a cushion that you could maybe not really worry about margin expansion as much because you got such great MBS margins. And think about the growth that you could possibly get even higher growth, if you give up a little bit more on the margin expansion. So, just kind of a high-level. How do you think about the tug-of-war between the pricing that you want to get the growth. Do you want rest of the margins that you had on that?","Evan Greenberg","Yes, I don't think about it that way. And not how an underwriting organization really thinks about it. Your question is, in a sense, be simplistic. We quote the rates and prices and underwriting terms that we require in each line of business, to earn what we think is an adequate risk adjusted return as expressed by a combined ratio in that line of business. It then all mixes together in portfolio, which you then see as an overall published average combined ratio.","And so you can't in the commercial P&C business, which runs higher than the average that you look at, as a whole company. You then dig down by line and there are lines of business that are - that we think are adequate now, or maybe a bit above the adequate in some cases, and there are lines of business that are below adequate, and we'll continue to drive for rate.","Wherever we see adequacy and we like the risk-reward, we're hardly holding back on growth. And I think the question is a little ironic this quarter, when you're asking it in the backdrop of fundamentally a 10% growth rate on an organization of this size. I hope that helps you.","Michael Phillips","Okay. Yes, thanks. A little more detail than on the\u2026","Evan Greenberg","I think you had a second question.","Michael Phillips","I did. Yes, thanks. This is more detail on Overseas General, it kind of nitpicky question here on your expense ratio, how to think about that in 2020? I mean, it looks like it's ticked up a bit throughout '19 more on the acquisition expense and what's behind that to the return 2020?","Evan Greenberg","Yes, it's pretty - it's pretty simple. About one-third of it, as - of the increase is related to one-time items last year that, that benefited last year's expense ratio, from about one-third of it is, is mix of business, where it's business runs a lower loss ratio, higher expense ratio, and some of the partnerships we have will have that signature to them, because the mix of product is a lower loss ratio related.","And the third is investments we've been making in certain businesses, particularly in Asia and to a degree in Latin America to grow - for future growth, and we'll grow into our sleeves there and the expense ratio will ameliorate and improve.","Operator","We'll now hear from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.","Paul Newsome","I want to ask about North American casualty, the loss trend that you mentioned, because that seems to be a big topic of just how you might be accelerating. Could you a little talk about maybe what's going on there as well as, I would imagine, tell me if I'm wrong, there are pieces in there with some pretty high loss trends maybe D&O, professional liability? And then where are the offsets?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. No. Yes, without going into too much detail, just to give the shape of that a little bit. First of all, I don't agree with your last comment. I think, it's - I don't - it's not how we see it. D&O is an old story. We've been talking about it for a while. Frequency and severity both moved up, but that was a couple of years ago. And we've seen it pretty steady at that elevated level. We don't see that continuing to deteriorate overall, and that's all classes that we've mixed together in there. There are some classes, individual classes, sub-classes that, that have an increasing frequency, but overall.","In primary casualty, we're seeing severity stable. We haven't - in the risk transfer primary casualty area, we haven't noticed a deterioration. In workers comp, in the risk transfer comp business through the year, we've seen an increase of severity, particularly on the '18 and '19 years.","And by the way, so all of our loss cost trends, we're comfortable with our OpEx. And we're constantly looking at updated data. And the trends we see are reflected in our loss cost fix for the year, for the back years and inform us as we go forward into the '20 year. I hope that helps you.","Paul Newsome","No, no. I think it makes sense. And then secondly, I just want to make sure, and I think, I have a good guess at this, but that the Asian exposure to all this virus, just the economic turmoil that's resulting there. I would imagine, and tell me if I'm wrong that you've got fairly minimal exposures through losses, but there might be some sales disruption just because people will not be able to get out. Is that a kind of a good way to think about it, or is there something else I should be thinking about. I don't expect\u2026","Evan Greenberg","We're experienced, we're informed in our underwriting from past pandemics and\/or potential pandemics. SARs was a good run at this. And given our underwriting position, and how we think about supply chains, and how we think about property in the perils we cover, et cetera. We see very minimal loss exposure on this. We have a very small, almost non-exist and accident and health business in China.","And we don't see - we imagine modest impact from everything we can tell, from economic slowdown or economic activity. But time will tell in that regard. We don't know the true infection rate likely and we don't know when this is going to peak. And so that's what I can give you based on what we know today.","Paul Newsome","Obviously, keeping our fingers crossed there. So thank you very much.","Operator","Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo has the next question.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question, Evan, in your prepared remarks you talked about strongest growth you guys have seen in five years. You also painted a picture of a lot of price going through your book that you said continued into 2020. So, as we think about 2020, do you see price and growth picking up as we move throughout the year. And I guess how long, do you have a line of sight in terms of how long do you think the upward pricing momentum might last?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. You're asking me a bunch of questions that you know, I'm not going to answer much, Elyse, but I admire you for asking. Look, I can't - I'm not going to prognosticate the balance of the year. I mean, the only thing I'll tell you is this, I think growth, we ran about 7% in '19, and I think that will be in the range, if not better in the '20 underwriting year is my sense of it, but no guarantees and there's always a little volatility quarter-to-quarter given some seasonality and mix of business. So, you never see it in just some steady way.","On pricing, I think, it endures. The fundamentals speak to it. And so the environment we see is the environment I imagine and will continue for some time, it's rational. And there are many reasons for it. And there is nothing that I see that tells me the momentum will slow. If anything, it's picked up, and it is spreading more broadly. Industry needs rate and needs it in quite a number of classes and across the globe.","And then you're in a low interest rate environment and you can hardly rely on investment income to bail you out. And the industry needs rate because rate has just not kept pace with loss cost trends for quite a number of years. The math is so simple. People seem to over intellectualize this.","And then on the other side of the coin, in the numerator, there are a few discrete classes where the loss environment is more hostile, and that is out there. That is understood. That is known and you either recognized it and reflected it in your reserves and in your loss picks and pricing in the past come, or it's something that you're doing with currently and is in front of you. But I think that just varies by organization.","Elyse Greenspan","And then secondly on - we've heard a lot in the reinsurance market about prices going up at January 1, and I think there are some expectations. We'll see that continuing throughout the year. Does Chubb, have any thoughts of changing their reinsurance program in a significant degree for what you had placed in 2019, your outbound program?","Evan Greenberg","I'm not - that is a treaty-by-treaty book of business by book of business decision. We make rational decisions around all of that. And so I'm not going to make any general statements about that.","Elyse Greenspan","And then one last question. In the past, you guys have given us your excess capital, in terms of the drag on your ROE. Could you let us know about where that will sit after you make the next investment within the Huatai. Have you increased your stake over the next couple of deals?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. Go ahead, Philip.","Philip Bancroft","5% to 7%, drag on the ROE. I'm sorry, 5% to 7%.","Evan Greenberg","Oh, it's not 5%, it's 0.5%.","Philip Bancroft","I'm sorry, 50 basis points to 70 basis points.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Evan Greenberg","Elyse, what we said is 50 basis points to 75 basis points of drag on ROE.","Operator","And our next question will come from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","Evan, I think in response to previous question, you had said that, you'd seen the D&O option started to deteriorate at least two years ago or about two years ago. Just curious what happened, six months ago, four months ago, when rates started to really move up? Why was there kind of year-and-a-half lag there?","Evan Greenberg","Yes, sure. And by the way, we saw it, two years or three years ago, it's three years we've been talking about it, because it was the '17 year, '17, '18, '19. So, sorry, even longer. You know, look, you get notices. Notices turn into - you get notices of circumstance. You get - you then get notices of claim.","You get those turning into incurs. And then ultimately they move to cash flow. And those who have large books of this, teach and play both the primary and the excess they see it and they play. First, layer excess they see it earlier and have a sense of it, have the data, have the experience to know, which cases are going to turn into which - what kind of loss.","And what is a realistic loss amount around that case? They have the data and understanding to see it law firm behavior. And by the way, the nature of the type of claims that are changing and how they're being made. And so you get a sense of all of that early if you're in the position and which we are, and we're a market leader that way. And we see it on a global basis. We could look at it early. There are others who just - they arrive at it late and they arrive at it when it turns into incurred and paid losses. And you get an education, but you pay a tuition for it.","Yaron Kinar","And then my second question not really related, North America Personal. I think that delta between adjusted net premiums written and our growth in net premiums growth had been positive for the last four quarters and then this quarter it turn negative. Just trying to understand that the dynamic there. I know that you guys have added a quota share insurance - reinsurance policy for California. But just trying to understand what happened that quarter?","Evan Greenberg","I think you are - I think you're confused - I'm sorry, maybe we're looking at different numbers for you confused. We grew, first of all, on a published basis at 9%. When you adjust for the California reinsurance, which we placed last year and it had a bigger impact last year than this year because we made a premium transfer to them of unearned premium. If you understand how that works.","And therefore the adjusted real growth rate is 4.5%. If you look back on previous quarters, is our best growth in premium terms and the year. And it has a combination of rate and a reasonable level of retention as we also shape the portfolio, and there are areas where we're eliminating exposure and by the way we got 13 points of price change in the quarter.","Operator","Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse has the next question.","Mike Zaremski","First question maybe sticking on personal lines. Yeah, the pricing in personal lines seems to have accelerated and I know you've talked about reshaping the portfolio. And I also believe in past quarters, you've been cited as saying loss costs in personal lines is as high as the high-single digits. Maybe you can kind of talk about why loss costs inflation is at that level and some other of your competitors don't speak to it being that high and maybe you can talk about probably about the reshaping and what where you are in that reshaping? Thanks.","Evan Greenberg","Yes, sure. First of all, I don't know who you're thinking of as a competitor, but we don't write general market homeowners. We write only affluent. And the share of market we have in there is - and our reach, our national reach on that business is just five-fold. The loss costs in the homeowners business are running in that 8% range. They have been for some time.","Cost of materials, cost of labor, and there is a labor shortage and materials particularly at the high end, are very expensive. Business interruption, business interruption, homeowners out of their homes, interrupted an extra living expense is up, because there is more remediation work in a claim than there was in the past more around mold and other conditions that people are more concerned about and that are focused on and get attention.","And then frequency of loss as contributed particularly in non-weather water-related, which we've talked about for some time and others have the same issues. So, when you add all that up, those are the main contributing factors to loss costs trend. I don't see it ameliorating by the way, not much.","Mike Zaremski","And lastly, thanks for the color on loss expense trend. I'm curious, when you talked about the trend in North America. Does that take into account some of the state changes in terms of the statutes of limitations, some reviver statutes? So maybe you could comment on that. Thanks.","Evan Greenberg","Yes. It takes into account everything we know in our portfolio. So, I'm not leaving anything out. However, on the reviver statute changes only - there's notices. There is notice activity and filing of claims. Like there is very little information at this moment to respond to. And that's going to be in my judgment quite a while developing. And I don't - there is not much to respond to at this point. Just take New York for example, all of the cases are being consolidated with one court and judge, who's going to just figure out how to move forward with these in a structured way.","So the rules and the process by which these will be adjudicated is yet to be determined. So you can't take discovery. You can't get information. You can't do anything right now. And that's the plaintiff and the defendant, let alone then the insurer that is a derivative of all of this. So it's going to evolve over a period of time, but right now, anything we know where it's - where it can be estimated is in our numbers.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous.","Ryan Tunis","Evan, just in North America commercial, I was hoping you could give us some color on how you'd characterize the accident year loss ratio improvement, 64 versus 66 a year ago, 1.5 point of improvement sequentially. How - is that mostly we earned premium and excessive trend, was a benign attritional activity? I'm just trying to think about what's going on from a margin standpoint there?","Evan Greenberg","How would I characterize it? I'd characterize it as darn good. There you go. And look last year we did take some reserve charge, you will recall. So think about it, for a short-tail that did not repeat. And we've recognized a higher loss pick for that. And the improvement is a combination of earned rate underwriting, which frankly is more powerful than the earned rate and actions we take in that regard. And that's about it, because we had seen a lot of change in loss environment.","Ryan Tunis","To add one for Phil and then one more for Evan. But Phil, on the Huatai consolidation, how should we think about the impact that might have on either - on book value per share, tangible book value per share, if you do go over that 50% threshold?","Philip Bancroft","Yes. It's way too early for that. We're evaluating it. We'll continue to evaluate it, but I'm not ready to give you an impact on tangible at this point.","Ryan Tunis","Understood. And then, I guess keeping on these legacy issues we're having. For Chubb, and I guess the industry in general, how are you thinking about with the opioid litigation going on how that might manifest as an Insurance liability?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. And I don't think of that as legacy. I think of that is current. It's like other mass story that exists. So I don't see legacy in that. It's - when it comes to opioid, you got to make - we don't cover - insurance doesn't cover financial loss. We cover a loss due to bodily injury property damage. And you have to have that clear linkage in liabilities. You got approved liability.","And you got to prove in liability that have resulted in bodily injury and property damage, and\/or property damage. And the cases that are brought against pharma right now, are brought for financial loss, because the municipalities and society had a big financial penalty as a result of the overuse of opioids. That's what's alleged.","Then making the case to Insurance. Well, you've got - there's plenty of - you got to leap the hurdle, I just said in that regard. You got to be able to demonstrate that you didn't know that you weren't aware when you bought insurance that these things were going on and other defenses. And so right now as far as coverage and what exist, we look at our portfolio through that lens and through those eyes and that we see an estimated liability. We reflected in our records - in our books and records and therefore, our reserves.","Ryan Tunis","And I guess, my one follow there would be - is this something that the insureds understand the difference between BI and financial, or is just a type of - in other words, this is something you're able to sort out with your clients, or is this something that ultimately is going to have to be resolved, insurance-related disputes policy wording like that sort of thing?","Evan Greenberg","You know what Ryan, welcome to the insurance business. It varies by insured and a) both intellectually and their own character of do they - do you understand the spirit of intent. And then versus let's go torture the language and see what we can get. And so it's all over the lot, always all over.","Operator","We'll now hear from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","Evan, in your opening comments you noted that there was a small headwinds to premium growth from exposure as opposed to last quarter's small increase. I was wondering, whether there's anything significant in that change?","Evan Greenberg","No. And what I gave you, Meyer, was simply, which is kind of an over simplistic way of doing it. What I said to you was that pricing was up 8.5 in North America, all the businesses rolled up. And when that it was made up of 9 in rate and the half and exposure. That - negative exposure. That exposure change is just - we have businesses with positive exposure change in - more in the middle market and small commercial and then it jumps all over the lot in the large account business. And so, I wouldn't - there is - it's got puts and calls in it. There is no general theme to read into that whatsoever.","Meyer Shields","And then in the two North America, non-agriculture segment, so it was a bigger year-over-year increase in admin expenses than we've seen year-to-date through September. And I was hoping you could add some color to what's driving that?","Evan Greenberg","In which one are you looking at North America?","Meyer Shields","Commercial and personal, right, the admin expenses.","Evan Greenberg","I'm sorry.","Meyer Shields","The administrative expenses.","Evan Greenberg","Did you say North America, though?","Meyer Shields","Oh, I'm sorry, yeah. North America, commercial; North America, personal.","Evan Greenberg","North America, personal. There was nothing. Go ahead, Phil.","Philip Bancroft","There were a couple of items in the prior year related to pension and other benefits that benefited this last year. And so it makes it look like an increase this year.","Evan Greenberg","Pension adjustment expense.","Meyer Shields","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Evan Greenberg","It can bounce around a little bit year-by-year. You don't know, it will depend on interest rate levels and all that at the end of this year, how it will look versus the year before.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. Two here for you. And then just a quick follow up on Meyer's question about the exposure. I'm just curious, are you guys picking up market share right now and kind of what is the unit kind of growth in North America, commercial, as well as in overseas, or is this not the time for you guys to pick up market share?","Evan Greenberg","Well, I think we're picking up market share, but as far as unit, I think the numbers are trying to demonstrate that, but unit growth, we don't have a unit growth number for you.","Brian Meredith","Okay. But - I got you. But I guess\u2026","Evan Greenberg","Yes. No, we're picking up market share.","Brian Meredith","You're picking up market share. So I guess - the question I guess, Meyer was asking, the 8.5% pricing in North America, right? You said a little bit exposure. I would have thought that would be even higher\u2026","Evan Greenberg","You're missing it. No, you're missing how to define exposure.","Brian Meredith","Okay.","Evan Greenberg","We are growing - that's not how insurance companies, when they say exposure growth give it to you. So we're growing exposure by writing more clients. That 0.5% that goes into pricing happens to do with how clients - clients have a rate against exposure to determine their premium. That's their own payroll. That's their own receipts, et cetera. And they then report that to you and that goes into their actual premium price. Do you what I mean?","Brian Meredith","Right. Yes, yes. Absolute\u2026","Evan Greenberg","That's very different than - that's very different than is Chubb in its written premium growing exposure or we're growing exposure.","Brian Meredith","And then my second question. I'm just curious, on your Global A&H business, growth has been fairly muted for a little while. Is that just a function of just economic activity globally, or is there something else to read into that?","Evan Greenberg","No. Latin America is growing quite well. Europe grows at an unexciting sort of steady rate, low single digit. It's Asia Pac, where the underlying activity is very good and it's growing well, but we lost a client, Siam Commercial Bank earlier in the year and we talked about that and that has impacted that growth rate year-on-year. And what you'll see as the year goes along that A&H growth will pickup.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now hear from David Motemaden from Evercore.","David Motemaden","Just a quick numbers one for Evan and maybe Phil. Just on the civil unrest losses that we saw, the $33 million, is any of that spilling over into 1Q especially in Chile, just given the protests are still going on there?","Evan Greenberg","No, not that we see, de minimis.","David Motemaden","And then, just - I saw in the December slides, Evan, you had laid out around 45% of your business is exposed to a hardening rate environment. Just wondering what that percentage is today. Just given that it's spreading into other lines in other geographies?","Evan Greenberg","That's up. It's up - it's not up dramatically. We have an updated the number yet.","David Motemaden","And then with the Huatai investment or the increased stake, just wondering why you guys chose to increase your share there as opposed to maybe applying to get a fully owned license there like some of your peers have?","Evan Greenberg","Well, we do. We have a fully-owned, and Chubb Insurance is a wholly owned, completely 100% foreign invested. And if you want to go in that direction, that's the 100-year plan or more. We have with Huatai 600 offices around the country. We have most all provinces. It's a life insurance company that - and foreigners have just been allowed to now own majority in life insurance.","But it has a life insurance company that we built and help to build that is doing, closing on $1 billion revenue. It's got P&C company doing that $1.5 billion or so. Got a retail mutual fund license. Good luck getting one of those. It's got so much capability that it gives us to build from.","And if you go simply as a foreigner entering China, de novo to build it is very hot style both the regulatory and the business environment. And very difficult to get it done. You have to do it province-by-province. You got to go city-by-city. And not simply you get it at a national level, it's not how it works in China. So this is a very precious asset, if we execute well in recognizing the future value of that asset.","David Motemaden","Yes, understood. And I guess just thinking about in terms of the number of Board seats you there. I guess, how much control do you have over wide time? And obviously that will increase as you buy up your stake? And just some of those benefits that you had mentioned in terms of having the local expertise, which Pru U.K. has mentioned as well with their relationship with CITIC. Do you see any risk, once you guys go up to wholly ownership, or maybe even up to like 100% that, that becomes a headwind?","Evan Greenberg","No, I don't. And you know, I've been doing business there for almost 30 years. So I know something about the environment there. And approach it with my eyes open and from a perspective that I'm going to - that's the perspective with which I'm going to give you the next comment. When we have majority. We have very clear control. Right now we have substantial influence and control to do more things in there. But obviously, with the majority is when you have clear control, that will happen relatively near-term.","And secondly, China is like doing business anywhere. If you're a builder of business versus an investor, then you understand it not in some sterile way and that is that every territory, every country. China in particular are complicated and they have a risk around them. There is no guarantees. But the opportunity, if you execute well, and the opportunity in China is simply dramatic. It's a country of a lot of talented people.","Our ability to source talent, ability to recognize leadership, our ability to use talent that we have around the region and around the world, including Chinese, we have those tools and those advantages. And we've got it's a country of relationships. We have a lot of them.","And so it is again not without risk, but given the reward and the potential, and that it is the largest and what will be the largest economy in the world and it's the second largest now, well, I'll tell you what. It's not a hard decision to make that the long-term potential value creation for this organization. And that's what it's about long-term value creation.","David Motemaden","Yes, I totally agree. Thanks for the thoughts. Appreciate it.","Operator","Looks like we have time for one more question. And that question will come from Greg Peters with Raymond James.","Greg Peters","Thank you for fitting me in. I mean, I just had one question. I guess, it sort of dovetails with this long-term value creation comment you just made. If I look in your earnings press releases, you always include both core operating, return on equity results. And then you include a core operating return on equity on tangible equity results. So, I'm not trying to be argumentative, but could you remind me of the thought process behind that tangible reference? I assume, the goodwill from Chubb and other acquisitions continues to be valuable. So just looking for clarification there.","Evan Greenberg","Sure, it is. I am - first of all, I think tangible is your most constraining factor, when you are - when you in a balance sheet risk business. You can only pay claims against tangible. Can only grow your revenue and exposure to the extent of your tangible wherewithal. You can only borrow and you can only make acquisition to the extent of tangible, to your most constraining factor. Tangible is also the purest. Book, straight book has accounting, what I'd say is, more accounting related within it's more subjective than objective. When I look at the return on equity versus tangible return on equity, tangible is the one I have my eye on more for value creation.","When I look at equity and return on equity, the Chubb, I look at it over a long-term. And you said it right to me, depends on, it varies by company and you have to able to assess that. The goodwill, I think is an appreciating asset in this company, not a - hardly a depreciating or a stagnant. It opened the path to such future value creation of the organization that is occurring over time and will occur over time.","And the goodwill you grow into that goodwill and because it's an appreciating asset, the Chubb and ACE combination that created most of that, created that value that way. So that's how we see it. And I think it's the right balance and how we think about value creation. So, thanks for the question, I didn't take it as argumentative.","Greg Peters","Thanks for fitting me in.","Operator","That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back to your host for closing remarks.","Karen Beyer","Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to seeing you again next quarter.

Today's call is being recorded.","Before we begin, Chubb has asked me to make the following statements. In order to help you understand Chubb, its industry and its results, members of Chubb's management team will include in today's presentation forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is possible that actual results might differ from estimates and forecasts that Chubb's management team makes today. Additional information regarding factors that could cause such differences appears in Chubb's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In the prepared remarks today and responses to questions during today's presentation, Chubb's management may refer to financial measures that are not derived from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in the press release and the financial supplement for the second quarter 2013, which are available on the Investors section of Chubb's website at www.chubb.com.","Please also note that no portion of this conference call may be reproduced or rebroadcast in any form without Chubb's prior written consent. Replays of this webcast will be available through August 23, 2013. Those listening after July 25, 2013, should please note that the information and forecast provided in this recording will not necessarily be updated, and it's possible that the information will no longer be current.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Finnegan.","John D. Finnegan","Thank you for joining us. As we said in our earnings release, Chubb produced excellent results in the second quarter of 2013. We generated operating income per share of $1.77 and net income per share of $2.21, both of which were among the highest of any quarter in Chubb's history. These results were achieved despite the adverse impact of catastrophe losses of $0.59 per share.","Earnings in the quarter benefited from a positive effect on earned premiums of rate increases in recent periods and the continued low level of non-cat loss activity. Net written premiums for the quarter were flat. We produced a combined ratio of 88.8, including nearly 8 points of catastrophe losses. Excluding catastrophes, our combined ratio was 80.9%, which is 5.4 points better than in the second quarter of last year and the best x cat combined ratio we'd have in any quarter since 2007. These results reflect our focus on bottom line profitability, underwriting discipline and push for higher rates, necessitated by the dual headwinds of lower investment income and continued high levels of catastrophe losses.","Annualized operating ROE for the second quarter was 13.1%. Annualized GAAP ROE was 14.7%. GAAP book value per share at June 30, 2013, was $60.76. Our capital position is excellent, and we made good progress in our share repurchase program as Ricky will discuss later.","In terms of the U.S. market environment, the data would indicate that the second quarter was at least as strong as the first. In homeowners, written renewal change increased nearly 0.5 point to just over 7 points and is now more than 2 points higher than in the second quarter of 2012 without any impact on retention.","Professional liability was especially strong with a 9-point renewal rate increase, the same as in the first quarter, with retention moving up 3 points from 81 to 84. Professional liability renewal rate increases are now 2 points higher than they were all of calendar year 2012, with a slightly higher retention level.","In standard commercial lines, renewal rates continued to increase at an 8% level, consistent with our experience over the last 18 months, with retention dropping 1 point from 84 to 83, through the intentional non-renewal of one large poor performing account. Outside the U.S., renewal rates for CCI and CSI ranged from flat to low-single digit increases. We also had rate improvement in personal lines comparable to that in the U.S.","Coming on the heels of a great first quarter, the outstanding second quarter helped us attain a record operating income per share of $3.91 for the first 6 months of 2013, as well as record net income per share of $4.69. In light of our performance in the first half of the year and our outlook for the second half, we've increased our guidance for full year 2013 operating income per share to a range of $7.30 to $7.50 from the $6.40 to $6.80 range we provided in our January 2013 guidance. We have raised our guidance despite an increase in our catastrophe loss assumption for the full year from 4 percentage points to 4.6 points.","And now for more details on our operating performance, we'll start with Paul, who will discuss Chubb's Commercial and Specialty Insurance operations.","Paul J. Krump","Thanks, John. The Chubb Commercial Insurance net written premiums for the second quarter declined 3% to $1.3 billion. The combined ratio was 89.9 versus 97.5 in the second quarter of 2012. The impact of catastrophes in the second quarter of 2013 was 8.1 percentage points, nearly identical to the 8.2 points we had in the corresponding quarter of 2012.","Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI\u2019s second quarter combined ratio improved 7.5 points to 81.8 from 89.3 in the second quarter of 2012, due to improved rate levels, as well as unusually low non-cat property losses. We are pleased that CCI's average U.S. renewal rates increased in the second quarter by 8%, the ninth consecutive quarter of rate increases in the United States for CCI. The 8% compares with the 8% we obtained in this year's first quarter and 9% in the year-ago second quarter. This level of rate increases has been consistent through the past 6 quarters. CCI obtained U.S. renewal rate increases in each line of business in the second quarter of 2013.","General liability rates increased the most with a low double-digit average. These were followed by monoline property, workers' compensation, package, Excess\/Umbrella, automobile, boiler and marine. Rate increases across the product lines were very similar to what we obtained in the first quarter of this year.","In CCI markets outside of the United States, average renewal rate increases in Canada, Europe and Australia were in the low-single digit range in the second quarter, similar to the first quarter of this year. Average renewal rates in Latin America and Asia were flat in the second quarter, also similar to the first quarter.","CCI\u2019s second quarter U.S. renewal retention rate was 83%, down 1 point from the first quarter of the year. CCI\u2019s new-to-lost business ratio in the United States was 0.7:1 in the second quarter, down from 0.8:1 in the first quarter. The 3% decline in CCI\u2019s worldwide premiums in the second quarter included a 7% decline in written premiums outside of the United States.","With the exception of Asia Pacific, premiums declined in each of CCI\u2019s 3 other zones outside of the United States. Growth was down the most in Europe, where the sluggish economy negatively impacted renewal exposure growth. In addition, in many countries and industry segments outside of the U.S., we experienced greater resistance to rate increases, and this took a toll on both renewal retention and new account acquisition. As we remain disciplined in our underwriting and pricing analysis, we find certain segments of the market are still unattractively priced. Finally, our growth outside the U.S. reflected a small adverse impact from currency translation.","In the United States, CCI premiums in the second quarter were down 1%, reflecting a slight decline in retention along with a decline in renewal exposure. These declines resulted primarily from our decision to non-renew a large unprofitable account and to greatly reduce our participation on another sizable account, which has substantial cat exposure in the Northeast.","Turning to Chubb Specialty Insurance. Net written premiums declined 2% in the second quarter to $626 million, and the combined ratio was 86%. For the professional liability portion of CSI, net written premiums were down 1% to $549 million, and the combined ratio was 91.9%, a 6-point improvement compared to the 97.9% we recorded in the second quarter of 2012.","We are very encouraged that average renewal rates for professional liability in the U.S. increased by 9% in the second quarter, making it the seventh consecutive quarter of rate increases. The 9% increase compares to 9% in the first quarter of this year and 7% in the second quarter a year ago.","CSI obtained renewal rate increases in the United States in each of its professional liability lines of business in the second quarter of 2013. Rate increases were led by private company D&O, which experienced average renewal rate increases in the mid-teens. Private company D&O rate increases were followed by EPL, not-for-profit D&O, public company D&O, crime, E&O and fiduciary.","In markets outside of the United States, average renewal rates for professional liability improved in the second quarter by low-single digits, with small variations by territory. Renewal premium retention for professional liability in the second quarter was 84% in the U.S., an improvement of 3 points over the first quarter. The new-to-lost business ratio for professional liability in the U.S. also improved to 0.7:1 in the second quarter from 0.6:1 in the first quarter of this year.","With respect to the overall market tone for professional liability lines in the second quarter, we saw the U.S. market experience a more widespread acceptance of the need for rate increases for the typical account, especially in the EPL and private company D&O lines. In fact, in the United States, we secured rate increases on 84% of all the professional liability policies that we renewed in the second quarter compared to 73% in the first quarter.","Regarding the surety portion of CSI, net written premiums in the second quarter were down 7% to $77 million, and the combined ratio was an outstanding 42.1%. As you know, surety is a lumpy business. For example, a 7% decline in second quarter surety premiums is in contrast to the 30% growth we experienced in the first quarter of this year when several existing customers won larger bondable projects.","And with that, I will turn it over to Dino, who will review our personal lines results as well as corporate-wide claims.","Dino E. Robusto","Thanks, Paul. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 4% to $1.2 billion, and CPI produced a combined ratio of 89.6% compared to 91.2% in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes on CPI's second quarter combined ratio was 12.7 points in 2013. In the second quarter a year ago, the cat impact on CPI's combined ratio was 11.5 points.","On an x cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 76.9% in the second quarter compared to 79.7% in the second quarter of 2012. Homeowners' premiums grew 4% for the quarter, and the combined ratio was 86.9% compared to 90.3% in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 20.1 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the second quarter of 2013 compared to 18 points in the second quarter of 2012. I'll provide more detail on catastrophes when I review corporate-wide claims activity.","Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the 2013 second quarter homeowners' combined ratio improved to 66.8% from 72.3% in the same period a year ago, reflecting an unusually low level of non-cat fire losses.","Personal auto premiums increased 5%, and the combined ratio was 95.3% compared to 93.2% in the second quarter of 2012. The growth in personal auto for the quarter reflected higher premiums both in the United States and outside the U.S.","In other personal, which includes our accident, personal excess liability and yacht lines, premiums were up 3%, and the combined ratio was 93.3% compared to 92.6% in the second quarter a year ago. Policy retention in the second quarter was 91% for homeowners and 89% for auto, both of which are essentially unchanged from the first quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2012.","In the second quarter of 2013, we achieved homeowners rate and exposure premium increases totaling about 7% in the United States. In short, Personal lines had another excellent quarter.","Turning now to claims corporate wide, catastrophe losses for the second quarter totaled $237 million before tax, with $173 million coming from the U.S. and $64 million stemming from catastrophes outside the U.S.. Personal lines accounted for about 55% of the catastrophe losses, and Commercial Lines for about 45%. There were 14 declared cat events in the United States in the second quarter of this year. However, most of the losses we experienced were from 4 severe thunderstorms, hail and wind events in the central United States. The most severe of the 4 was the tornado in Moore, Oklahoma, which particularly affected one of our large commercial customers.","Outside the United States, we had 5 cat events, but roughly 90% of our losses were attributable to the floods in Southern Alberta. Several affluent communities in Calgary, where we have a significant market share of the high-value homes, were particularly impacted by this unprecedented event in Alberta's recorded history. By contrast, we had virtually no losses from the severe flooding event in Central Europe.","Now I'll turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail.","Richard G. Spiro","Thanks, Dino. As usual, I will discuss our financial results for the quarter and I will also review our updated earnings guidance.","Looking first at our operating results, we had strong underwriting income of $317 million in the quarter compared to $159 million in the second quarter a year ago. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 6% to $286 million due once again to lower reinvestment rates in both our domestic and international fixed maturity portfolios.","Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $179 million, or $0.44 per share after tax, of which $0.12 per share came from our alternative investments. During the quarter, we also recognized a gain of $0.21 per share related to the merger of Alterra Capital and Markel Corporation. The remainder of our gains during the quarter came principally from the sale of equity securities.","For comparison, in the second quarter of 2012, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $47 million, or $0.11 per share after tax, of which $0.13 per share came from alternative investments. Unrealized depreciation before tax at June 30, 2013, was $2 billion compared to $3.1 billion at the end of the first quarter. Unrealized depreciation declined this quarter due to the recent sharp rise in interest rates. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $42.9 billion as of June 30. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter.","The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.8 years, and the average credit rating is Aa3. We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At June 30, 2013, our holding company portfolio had $2 billion of investments, including approximately $600 million of short-term investments.","Book value per share under GAAP at June 30, 2013, was $60.76 compared to $60.45 at year-end 2012 and $58.54 a year ago. GAAP book value in the quarter was negatively affected by the change in unrealized depreciation that I described earlier.","Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $57.03 compared to $53.80 at 2012 year end and $52.34 a year ago. As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the second quarter of 2013 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: in CPI, we had about $40 million; CCI had $115 million; CSI had $55 million; and reinsurance assumed had $5 million, bringing our total favorable development to about $215 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the second quarter combined ratio of about 7 points over all.","For comparison, in the second quarter of 2012, we had about $165 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $30 million CPI, $85 million in CCI, $40 million in CSI and $10 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the second quarter of 2012 was about 5.5 points, including about 0.5 point of favorable development from prior year catastrophes.","For the second quarter of 2013, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 88% compared to 91.4% in last year's second quarter, an improvement of nearly 3.5 points. During the second quarter of 2013, our loss reserves increased by $19 million, including an increase of $36 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $17 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in run-off. The overall increase in reserves reflects an increase of about $60 million related to catastrophes, and the impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in an increase in reserves of about $50 million.","Turning to capital management. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares at an aggregate cost of $323 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $87.28 per share. At the end of the second quarter, we had $758 million available for share repurchases under our current authorization. As we have said previously, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2014.","Before turning it back to John, let me provide you with some additional details on our revised guidance. We have increased our guidance for operating income per share for the full year to a range of $7.30 to $7.50 from the range of $6.40 to $6.80 that we had provided in January. As John mentioned, our increased guidance reflects our strong x cat operating performance in the first half of this year, as well as our outlook for the balance of the year.","Our increased guidance is based upon the following underlying assumptions: we expect our combined ratio for 2013 to be about 88% compared to the January guidance assumption of 89% to 91%; we are assuming 5 points of catastrophe losses for the second half of 2013. Based on the 4.3 points of actual cat losses that we had in the first half, our assumption for the full year calculates to 4.6 points, with 0.6 of a point higher than the 4 point cat assumption in our original guidance.","This increase in our catastrophe assumption is more than offset by the expected improvement in our full year x cat combined ratio. For those who would like to make a higher or lower cat assumption, the impact of each percentage point of catastrophe losses for the full year on operating income per share is approximately $0.30.","We expect net written premiums for the full year to increase 1% to 3%, including a 1% negative impact of foreign currency translation based on exchange rates as of June 30, 2013.","Our January 2013 guidance had assumed that net written premiums would be up 2% to 4% with no impact to foreign currency translation. We expect property and casualty investment income after tax to be down 6% to 8%. Our January guidance assumed a decline of 7% to 9%.","Finally, we assume 259 million average diluted shares are outstanding for the full year compared to 216 million shares in our January guidance.","And now I'll turn it back to John.","John D. Finnegan","We had an outstanding second quarter with operating earnings per share of $1.77 and an annualized operating ROE of 13.1%. This performance was driven by a terrific x cat combined ratio of 80.9%. These results came on top of record first quarter performance and resulted in a record 6-month operating income per share of $3.91, an x cat combined ratio of 82.4% and an annualized operating ROE of 14.7%. GAAP ROE for the first 6 months was 15.6%.","As has frequently been the case over the last few years, this quarter was marked by a high level of catastrophe losses and an unusually low level of non-cat losses. On the catastrophe side, losses have been above our historical averages for the last 3 years, and this trend has continued into the first half of 2013. It's the combination of higher catastrophe losses and lower investment yields, which continues to drive our rate [indiscernible].","Excluding catastrophes, our first half combined ratio of 82.4% was the second best we've recorded in recent memory. These outstanding results have been driven in part by significant rate increases, which have resulted in longer-term margin expansion in the United States, as our earned rate is now running about 2 to 3 points above our long-term x cat loss cost trends.","In addition to margin expansion, our results have benefited from an unusually low level of non-catastrophe-related losses, which recently have been running well below longer-term trend lines. In part, this can be ascribed to rigorous underwriting initiatives implemented 2 years ago to color our existing book as to greatly enhance underwriting discipline as it relates to new business. Both have had the intended effect of significantly re-profiling our book for the better.","At the same time, however, we recognize that we've also enjoyed a great deal of good fortune in terms of the unusually low level of non-catastrophe-related losses. This is particularly illustrated by our outstanding first half results in our commercial and homeowners property lines. We have benefited from the absence of almost any large losses. In homeowners alone, fire losses were down 5 points in the second quarter from historical averages.","In terms of the current environment, the U.S. market remains firm as evidenced by the fact that we continued to achieve mid- to high-single digit rate increases in all our business units in the second quarter, with generally stable retention levels. Assuming rate increases at or close to current levels in the second half of the year, this should result in continued margin expansion, although actual results in the second half will be more a function of swings in actual loss experience than longer-term trends.","In developing our updated guidance, we believe it to be overly optimistic to assume that large losses would continue to run at unusually low levels. Thus we have assumed some partial reversion to higher historical levels of loss experience from large losses in the second half of the year. This is one of the reasons for our forecast 2-point deterioration in our second half x cat combined ratio from our near record first half performance.","Even with this forecast of deterioration, our revised guidance at the midpoint implies operating income per share in the second half of $3.49, which will be the best operating EPS of any second half in our history. The bottom line is that we performed superbly in the first half of 2013 from both a market and profitability perspective.","Going forward, we are optimistic about the rest of the year as is evidenced by our updated guidance. As Ricky has indicated, all of this results in updated operating income per share guidance of $7.30 to $7.50 for the full year, which would easily be record calendar year results for Chubb.","And with that, I'll open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","2 quick questions. I guess, first is a numbers question. You mentioned there was a large unprofitable account that was non-renewed. Can you sort of quantify what the impact was?","John D. Finnegan","It was about 1 point. It was about the entire reason for the 1 point decline in retention. Now there are obviously a lot of pluses and minuses around that, but it was about 1 point.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","1 point. Okay, that's helpful. The other question is, in the opening remarks you mentioned this is the ninth consecutive quarter of rate increases, obviously, very strong rates. As you look forward, do you expect to be able to push forward for these rates? Or do you think we are at an inflection point in terms of pricing?","John D. Finnegan","I don't have a crystal ball, and there are lots of opinions all over the place. I'd say that we had as strong second quarter as we had a first. And we seem to be off to a pretty good start in the third quarter. So I guess trees don't grow to heaven and at some time, it may change but right now, we're feeling pretty good about the market.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Got it. And then can you also talk about -- and this is the last question, on -- I guess, the interplay between exposure change and the economy? Have you seen some initial impact of that on your numbers yet?","Paul J. Krump","Amit, this is Paul, and thanks for congratulating us on the quarter. As respect to the CCI numbers, the interplay here is quite interesting for the quarter. First of all, workers' compensation actually had some renewal exposure increase, that means our customers actually gave us higher payroll projections for the year going forward than they had in the past. The drop was really in the other lines, and I would tell you that after Irene and Sandy, we looked at our cat exposure, in particular in the Northeast, and there were a number of accounts where we decided to take smaller participations on them. That dropoff in participation gets recorded as an exposure dropoff, and that's really what impacted the exposure. As respects going forward, you probably have a better handle than I do on the economy, but I think it's probably much the same. But I don't think we'll have the same type of culling exercise going on in the Northeast that we experienced in the second quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you comment on pricing and competition in Personal lines in the U.S., auto versus homeowners?","Dino E. Robusto","Yes, in our case, the pricing continues. We continue to have good momentum in both the auto and homeowners. On our homeowner rate increases, we are in the process of filing mid- to high-single digits and up to about the low teens in some areas of the Northeast, as I've mentioned previously. And so, that's -- so continued momentum because if you look at it historically, 2011, we had ended the year with our homeowner renewal change written impact for a rate and exposure about 3%. By year-end '12, we had gotten a 5% and we expect to have about 7% at the end of '13. And in auto, we've gotten a couple of points of rate and we're also seeing some exposure on auto and we expect that to continue. Momentum is good on both homeowners and auto.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And what about auto loss cost expenses, if I may?","Dino E. Robusto","Yes, so our loss cost trend on auto is roughly about 3 points. So with our pricing and our exposure changes that we're seeing, we're about at loss cost, and going forward, we'll see some meaningful margin expansion, all else, of course, being equal.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And lastly, I know you guys don't have a crystal ball, but you have a decent size of book of business of workers' comp, does Chubb expect medical loss inflation levels to rise next year when the Affordable Care Act is implemented?","Paul J. Krump","I don't think we're necessarily going to predict which way it's going to flow. We've had a lot of debates here. But at this point, it's really -- the house is divided it's going to go up or maybe even come down.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gregory Locraft from Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to just sort of understand, from an ROE perspective, things are running really well now. It sounds like you're not going to take the foot off on the pricing side, margins should continue to expand. Is there an ROE that you're sort of aiming for or trying to get to or -- yes, I mean how do you think about where -- how much you want to do?","Richard G. Spiro","Greg, it's Ricky. As we stated in the past, our ROE target has been pretty consistent over the last number of years. Our goal is to achieve a return on equity of inflation plus 10% over the life of a cycle. This, obviously, would imply that we would expect that to perform its target in hard markets and possibly underperform it in soft markets. And if you look at our historical results, we've tracked pretty well with this objective through past cycles and at this time, that -- we're sticking with that ROE target.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, are you at that target now? I mean, it seems like you guys are hitting that.","Richard G. Spiro","Yes, yes, we are hitting it. When you look at it on a reported basis. But when you look at it on an accident year basis, even with the 88% x cat accident year combined ratio we had in the second quarter, if you add a normalized cat load on top of that, and we can all debate what's the right normalized cat load, you're still talking about accident year ROEs that are high-single digits, low-double digits and that's, for us, and we think our numbers are going to be probably as good as anyone in the industry, right? So if you look at the rest of the industry, they're still in single-digit land in terms of ROE on an accident-year basis.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","With regard to the pace of rate improvement, particularly in CCI, we've heard from a number of other insurers that the pace of improvement in rate and price has crested. So I'm just thinking -- I'm just trying to get a better sense of what you feel is different about your book that rate increases are sustained, not only in 2Q, but you're saying also that, that could probably still be the case for the remainder of this year?","Paul J. Krump","Jay, it's Paul. I'll take a stab at this. Let me maybe just talk a little bit about the second quarter and then what we know so far. I mean, rate increases for our commercial business in June were very consistent with the overall rate increases for the entire second quarter. With respect to the market in July, we obviously do not have the final data for the month. However, based on the preliminary assessment of interim monthly reports, some of the feedback from our most trusted field officers, we're seeing no significant change in overall market tone. This is probably at odds with some of the industry participants who have suggested that some parts of the commercial market may be softening or experiencing some additional competition. But probably the big difference with us is that we're primary a middle-market commercial player. We hear the talk about the large property accounts. We have much less participation in that jumbo risk management property market than many others that might be making those comments. So we'll -- right now, everything that we see, it's very much similar to what we saw in the first quarter and what we saw in the second quarter. And speculating going forward is -- we're just not going to do it.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then the other point I just wanted to clarify was on the 2Q CSI, the downshifting in growth there. I mean, I know you talked about pulling back a bit on catastrophe exposed, commercial accounts, including in the Northeast, but I'm just wondering, what else is going on there to have overall CCI down 3% year-over-year, when it was, I believe, up around 3% in the first quarter?","Paul J. Krump","Yes, you're going to see some bouncing around when it comes to the exposure. I mean, it really was, I think, the anomaly when we looked at it, really was that, that action that we were taking on a number of the property accounts. Obviously, the sluggish economy is playing a role here. And then overseas is playing a big piece of it as well. In the markets overseas, we haven't been getting the overall rate increases that we've been getting in the United States. Our focus overseas is very much like it is in the United States -- it's on profit. Our book overseas is as profitable as our book in the United States over the recent years. So -- but we still believe ultimately, we need to take rate there as well.","John D. Finnegan","Jay, I'd add that I think the second quarter had a few anomalies in it. But I do think that growth will be -- will not be robust in CCI, given our focus on profitability. However, we are certainly expecting to be back in the positive zone in CCI growth in the second half of the year without affecting the way we underwrite. So we -- what we have in guidance implies a positive growth in CCI in the second half of the year.","Richard G. Spiro","This is Ricky. One quick clarification to my earlier comment on accident year ROE. I just want to make it clear that when I'm talking about accident year return, we are talking about new money rates and not looking at the existing portfolio yield on our portfolio. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So, I guess, first question. Do you guys, by any chance, do you use, Ricky, any derivatives or anything on the interest and management side as far as the portfolio is concerned? And is there an interest rate scenario where you might do that or is that not kind of part of the protocol?","Richard G. Spiro","It's something that we've looked at from time to time. We just never thought that the risk reward of it made sense, so we have not done it in the past. I wouldn't really doubt, but it's not something we've done historically to any great extent.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then, I guess, I mean, I could try to do the math and get close. But if you were to back out to the second quarter, I mean, how much of the increase in guidance is related to the big favorable development that we saw in the second quarter, as opposed to better outlook for the back half of the year on an underlying basis?","John D. Finnegan","I'll take that. It's sort of 2 different questions. I mean, obviously, the improvement of guidance per year is a function of how well we did in the first half to some degree, clearly. As I said, we are forecasting about a 2-point deterioration in x cat combined ratio in the second half from the first half due to what we believe to be -- it'd be very bullish to assume we're going to continue to have such a low level of large losses. That 2-point deterioration still gives us a second half x cat combined ratio which is better than the -- our initial January guidance for the full year. How those come about, those -- some come in a variety of scenarios and the large losses could hit in a variety of ways whether it be by business unit or accident year prior period development. So we don't break out any prior period development number for the second half of the year. I think that attainment of the -- our objective in the second half will require some prior period development, clearly, but it's under a variety of scenarios, it has no precise development number in it.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see. So I mean, and I guess professional liability and you're definitely getting a lot of rate. It seems like there may be some new folks looking to compete there -- obviously, you're not seeing that. But when I look at the rate gains that you've got and you're still kind of now several quarters of now, mid- to high-single-digit rate gains -- right, so you've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5 quarters above 5%, but it looks like if all the development in that segment is related to professional liability, you're still writing that business at over 100%. And maybe my math is wrong, but it seems to be the case. So I'm just trying to connect those 2. At what point do you get to -- how much more rate do you need to get to action your underwriting profitability there?","John D. Finnegan","It's a good point, you did -- your farmer's math is good. We ran the accident year at about 100% in the second quarter, similar to first quarter, slightly better. If you compare it to last year, our reported number was significantly better, 6 or 7 points, and about half of that was more development. The other half, we had an improvement of 3 points or so, a little -- an accident year combined ratio closer to 4 if you account for the the loss ratio. We talked about this on the year-end call and the first quarter call. We're not obviously happy with where we are. The rate we're getting is going to help us. Our loss ratios have continued to improve. It's a long tail line of business so I wouldn't expect we have a significant improvement in accident year during the current year. We have to get the data in. But if rates continue, we'll continue to improve next year on our accident year. And we're on the right wicket, but we have ways to go in professional liability. You're going to get down that -- get that down pretty low. But fortunately, we have a good deal of development that's occurred so we're happy about that.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just last one [indiscernible], Ricky, if you could talk a little about the reinsurance program? Any changes in price or coverage that you purchased specifically? And did you take up any -- or did you have any alternative capital participants take up any of your program?","Richard G. Spiro","Sure. I talked a little bit about the renewable of our cat program on the last call and there was a description in the first quarter Q. Really, no significant changes. And in terms of capital market's participants, other than the cap on that we've done, nothing significant at all from that point of view.","Operator","We'll hear next from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So over the past couple of years, you folks have been awfully disciplined, started early re-underwriting. And now, we're seeing -- the market maybe move away from me a little bit. I'm wondering when do you think you'll be able to shift back from sort of a clear focus on profitability to one that's a bit more balanced with growth in U.S. commercial and specialty, for example?","John D. Finnegan","Well, I think you take specialty, I mean, we've got to continue to focus. You heard the way we answered the last question, we have to continue to focus on profitability because at 100, there's no balance to be had. I mean, an accident year of 100 isn't acceptable, so we'll have a foot on the metal on that one for a while. If the market continues to improve, we'll see some growth to go with it, but we shall see. In commercial, obviously, we have a more profitable book. We are hoping that given the right environment, that you're going to see some new business now that's acceptable to us. The more rates improved, the more likely that is to occur. Look for a little improvement in Europe. I think that -- you see that second quarter when growth was low, 4% in the first quarter was probably in line with industry. And we expect to revert to the positive in the third and fourth quarters. So we'll always err on the side of profitability, especially in areas that require more rate, but we expect growth to improve from the second quarter until we get into the second half of this year.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, got it. That's helpful. And the question now, just a follow-up on the question of the low double-digit ROEs as starting to do with new money pricing targets. The question would be, with -- as written rate is running ahead of earned and we're starting to see the money rates rise, when you're sitting and working with your actuaries, what sort of magnitude of rate increases do you think we still need? And I think that's sort of a factual question, not a forecast one.","John D. Finnegan","Well, first -- I'll start on it. Written rate now, just to clarify, we've kind of caught up with earned rates and written rates for the most part except in Personal lines, it's a little to go, but commercial has been running 8% for so long, and written it, earned is there, and professional, there's not much of a difference. Personal, maybe there's a 1 point or 2 difference. So think of written and earned as being pretty close together. Now in terms of money rates, I'll let Rick to take that.","Richard G. Spiro","Sure. Look, honestly, we welcome the impact of higher yields on our investment income, but as I mentioned earlier, even with where new money rates are today, we're still not making what we deem to be acceptable accident year ROEs. And again, the industry is doing probably well behind us. So while the rise in rates is a nice -- in interest rates is a nice thing, it's certainly better than a decline in interest rates, there's still a long way to go. And we don't see that really impacting our push for rate.","Operator","We'll hear next from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","2 questions. The first is, you brought up your yield assumptions for the year on your portfolio modestly, but you took it up a little bit. I assume, I shouldn't say that, you took up your investment income assumption? Is that due to the good first half result or is it more due to the recent rise in interest rates that we've seen?","Richard G. Spiro","It's probably a combination, but -- the recent rise in interest rates has improved our outlook for reinvestment yields going forward compared to where we were when we started the year.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then, I guess, for Dino. I think I probably know the answer to this, based on the reserving actions you've taken, but can you talk about what you're seeing in liability claims cost for some of the longer-tail businesses you guys write?","Dino E. Robusto","Yes. So I'll give you a few stats on our claim trends. So I'll start with -- I'll give you some counts and then I'll give you a little view of severity on claims in general. Claim counts continue to be a good story in the U.S., excluding catastrophes, P&C, new writes claim counts overall we're down about 5% for the second quarter against the prior quarter and down 3% for 6 months of 2013, compared to the first 6 months of 2012. New write counts increased slightly for personal auto, physical damage. We're seeing exposure growth in that line. Homeowners, commercial property counts decreased despite an increase in non-cat weather and new write counts also decreased for commercial work comp, commercial general liability and professional liability. Let me get to severity and more of in line with your question, I mean the trends obviously vary significantly by line of business based on obviously different cost drivers. But we're seeing essentially claim cost severity increases that are generally consistent with our longer-term trend assumptions, but low- to mid-single digit severity for auto classes, mid-single digits for the core property and general liability classes and the mid- to upper-single digits for work comp and some excess liability. Now, on the longer tail professional liability severity, these we obviously look at a little bit differently from, obviously, auto and homeowners where there's a lot more consistency. So that we tend to look at, as we spoke in the past, some leading indicators such as security, class action filings and if you take a look at that, the number of SDAs under [indiscernible] is down for the second quarter against the prior quarter, and it's lower than the average -- the prior 4 second quarter so -- but in general, but from a severity standpoint, it's consistent with our longer-term assumptions that we've had.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And obviously, no change for the adverse this quarter?","John D. Finnegan","What [indiscernible], no change for the what?","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","For the worse, so in other words, you're not seeing any deterioration in this environment. It's remaining fairly benign, is that fair?","John D. Finnegan","Yes, I think claims count continue to come in very well. Loss experience on prior period, as you can tell, is coming very strong. Yes, things have been looking good on the loss front for about 1.5 years now.","Operator","We'll hear next from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, mostly a numbers question. On the guidance revision on the cat number. Is the increase related to higher-than-projected first half cats or are you guys thinking, we're going to be more conservative going forward on how we project our cats for the back half?","Richard G. Spiro","Last July we used the 4.5-point assumption for cat losses in the second half of the year in our updated guidance, Josh. This year we did decide to increase the pick by 0.5, really to reflect the higher level of cat losses that we've experienced in recent periods. No real magic or silver bullet, but we definitely have seen an uptick in the second half over the last few years. So we conservatively added 0.5 point to our normal second-half assumption.","John D. Finnegan","Probably comes from both, Josh. I mean, a little bit, but primarily from first half being higher than one would imply by our original 4 points, right? And then a little bit of conservatism maybe in the second half, although no cat assumptions have proved to be conservative in recent memory.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understandable, understandable. And then on the -- is there a new to retain business -- or new-to-lost business ratio that you can now share with us or some sort of details on that?","John D. Finnegan","What -- are you talking about a particular business line?","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I mean -- particularly, in the CCI lines mostly. But I mean, if you -- Personal lines, I don't think it matters much, given your business is somewhat unique, but on the Commercial lines.","Paul J. Krump","Yes, Josh, in the early remarks, the prepared remarks, I gave it both for CCI and CSI. And CCI, how quickly one forgets. It was 0.7:1 in the second quarter, which was down from 0.8:1 in the first quarter. Professional liability was up from 0.6 to 0.7.","John D. Finnegan","Probably due to higher retention.","Paul J. Krump","Yes, we had 3 points of better retention. So that's what helped drive that up.","Operator","We'll hear next from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","John, is it fair for 2Q to infer that the year-to-date outperformance due to fewer large losses is 2 points?","John D. Finnegan","You probably -- you must be into mathematics. I don't think we have that number, but you can -- we can talk about fire losses, we can talk about non-cat-related weather, it's easy -- you can get non-cat-related weather and you can itemize that a little bit more and quantify it better in Personal lines than in Commercial. Fire losses, especially, can quantify -- you can quantify them in both. And then you have Specialty where large losses affect you, too. So what I will say, in the second quarter, if you look at -- year-over-year second quarter, we had a 5.5-point improvement, 2 points of that was development, 3.4 points of that was accident year. If you apply the margin expansion, the theoretical margin expansion number to it, which assumes that your losses are running in line with longer-term loss trends, that's 2 points. So it gives you 1.5 in loss trends that -- actually loss cost that are below trend line, of which a big bunch or maybe even it all is related to unusual large losses.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. You talked for a while, I think about the continued need for some rate increases in Professional liability. Have you been trying to take bigger rate increases over the past couple of years than you've actually been able to?","John D. Finnegan","Oh, sure. If you're running 100, you'd like -- you'd need a lot more. We have. I mean, if you go back 2 -- if you go back only 2 years ago, we weren't getting any. So this has been kind of ramped up and it's pretty good. We'd like either larger and we'd like the ones we have to last a longer time, but we could use more rate in this business and also some improvement in the EPL area, a variety of areas where loss did trend up.","Paul J. Krump","This is Paul. Just to augment what John just said. We don't just take a one size fits all approach, though, to the pricing in this business. We spend a lot of time thinking about each account and what does it actually need. We tend to start off by putting each of the accounts into a 1 of 5 ranking and go from there, thinking about what we really need. There are certainly some accounts that we're happy to renew at flat. And there's others, quite frankly, that we've gotten 40% to 50% rate increases on. And if they walk, they walk.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Understood. Okay, and one last question, if I can. Obviously, there's been a lot of talk about the impact of interest rate increases on investment income expectations. I know that you've been reserving sort of incredibly conservatively, we see that in the releases. Is there any reason to expect future loss cost inflation to reflect the interest rate increase?","John D. Finnegan","No, I don't think there's any direct relationship between the 2 except to the extent that you believe that inflation is going to run up with interest rates. We haven't seen that to date. So you'd focus more on the underlying inflation rate than the interest rate. Obviously, in many periods, they are correlated but we haven't seen that yet. And even within the inflation rate, you've got to look at things that are very important to us, construction cost, health care cost, not quite the same as the CPI. And then as we said on analyst calls, we've had very benign loss experience except for 2 quarters in 2011 for a number of years. Inflation has been relatively low over that period, but loss cost things we've done have helped. Loss cost trends have been good. So right now, there's no sign of a lot greater inflation, so I don't think the interest rates have anything to do with that.","Operator","We'll hear next from Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is a numbers question. I just wanted to clarify that the benefit from lower large losses were about 1 to 1.5 points, is that what you said before? For the first half of this year?","John D. Finnegan","Let me clarify then, Vinay. No, what I said is, and I wasn't too precise. There's no real number for that. What I try to do is say, a question many of you asked is that how much of the quarter's improvement was due to margin expansion and how much was it due to loss experience that was different than margin expansion? So I just took a simple analysis of looking at this year's second quarter versus last year's second quarter, said it was about a 5.5-point improvement, of which 2 points were attributable to favorable development of the 3 -- other 3.5, you could theoretically attribute to the earned rate margin expansion. It was about 1.5. The 1.5 I referred to was that loss experience below theoretical long cost loss...","Richard G. Spiro","Long term.","John D. Finnegan","Long-term loss cost trends that are implicit in the margin expansion calculation. So if you just thought we'd improved by the amount of the margin expansion, we improved by 1.5 better than that because of lower loss -- lower actual loss experience. And that, I think that -- a good deal, all or maybe even all -- more than all were due to lower large losses but that's hard to break out.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure. And that's only for the second quarter, you're not talking about the first quarter, correct?","John D. Finnegan","Not talking about the first quarter, although the first quarter I think we had pretty -- we've similar. I forget the exact numbers, but yes, actual losses in the first quarter were lower than the long-term trend, too.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure, fair enough. And these trends, I mean, these are not specific only to Chubb, it's -- I mean I'm sure it's true with everybody, correct? About low loss cost trends or low loss cost?","John D. Finnegan","Yes, let's say -- so, yes, I mean I gather from the reports that it looks to me, like I don't know it looks like people had a pretty favorable loss experience. Non-cat-related weather, for example, is probably going to be relatively similar to everyone. Fire losses can be different. I mean, I don't think -- sometimes, people underestimate the sensitivity. In a quarter, we run $3 billion a premium. We have 1 limit fire loss of $30 million, you're talking 1 point on your combined ratio that can't be explained by margin expansion. We've had many quarters with 1 big loss or even 2 big losses. So fire losses tend to be a little bit more unique to an individual company than non-cat-related weather.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure, fair enough. Just a second question. And like this is an overall sort of industry question. And you guys have been pushing rates stronger and harder than I think most people have. But within the industry, we've seen rising interest rates, we've seen margins improving, low loss cost trends. What do you think keeps the momentum going for the industry to keep rates high?","John D. Finnegan","I believe that we don't know that will occur. We hope it will occur. What would be the driver? The driver would be the fact that alluding to what Ricky said, that accident year x cat combined ratios are not at target levels. Or stated another way, we have a rate need to get our new business to an acceptable return. And if we have that rate need running 80s and 82s on our x cats accident year, you can imagine the industry has a significant higher rate need. They're probably in the mid-single digits, that's not everyone. But as an average, it couldn't be better than that. So the industry has a need for rate adequacy, still. And again, that's doing the calc on new money rates, as it should be done, what you can earn on new business.","Richard G. Spiro","And also don't forget, as John pointed out in his remarks, the combination of the interest rate environment plus the higher level of catastrophe losses that we, in the industry, have experienced over the last number of years that continue to push for rate.","Paul J. Krump","Loss cost trend is always a pressure.","Operator","And we currently have no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the conference back over today's speakers.","John D. Finnegan","Thank you very much, and have a good evening.","Operator","Again, this does conclude today's conference.

Finnegan","Thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report that we had record operating income per share of $1.98 for the third quarter and a record $5.04 for the first 9 months. Our outstanding third quarter benefited from strong x cat underwriting results as well unusually low catastrophe losses. At the same time, we continued to achieve rate increases in all of our businesses. These positive factors were more than enough to offset the continuing effects of a challenging global economic environment and the impact of low interest rates.","Third quarter operating income per share of $1.98 resulted in annualized operating ROE of 15.5%. The combined ratio for the quarter was 86.3% compared to 102.6% last year. Excluding cat, the combined ratio for the third quarter was 85.7% in 2012, 2.5 points better than the 88.2% in the last year's third quarter.","Net income per share for the third quarter of 2012 was the same as operating income per share and annualized ROE for the quarter was 13.5%. Capital value per share at September 30 was $60.99, that's a 9% increase since year end 2011 and a 10% increase since September 30 a year ago.","Our capital position is excellent and we continue to make good progress on our share repurchase program. Net written premiums for the third quarter are up 1%, driven by Chubb Personal and Chubb Commercial Insurance, which were up 3% and 2%, respectively. Relative CPI and CCI was partially offset by a 4% decline in Chubb Specialty premiums.","Excluding the impact of currency translation, net written premiums for Chubb overall were up 3%. Given our strong results in the first 9 months and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we have raised our operating income per share guidance for the full year to a range of $6.70 to $6.80, which is an increase of $0.92 at the midpoint.","Let me now turn it over to Paul who will discuss the performance of Chubb's Commercial and Specialty Insurance operations.","Paul J. Krump","Thanks, John. At Chubb Commercial Insurance, net written premiums for the third quarter were up 2% to $1.2 billion. Combined ratio was 87.2% versus 101.1% in the third quarter of 2011.","Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's third quarter combined ratio was 87% compared to 89.9% in the third quarter of 2011. We are pleased that CCI's average U.S. renewal rate in the third quarter increased by 8%, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of rate increases for CCI. This compares to the 9% we obtained in this year's second quarter, with a slight decline primarily attributable to small differences in the mix of business available for renewal in the third quarter. What is especially encouraging is the fact that this year's 8% is solid rate-on-rate as it comes on top of the 4% average rate increase we secured in the third quarter of 2011.","CCI achieved U.S. renewal rate renewal increases in each line of business in the third quarter of 2012. Workers' compensation rates increased the most, with a low double-digit average, followed by Monoline property, general liability, package, excess umbrella, automobile, boiler and marine. Viewed from an account perspective, we continued to achieve broad-based pricing improvement, with some 90% of our renewals receiving rate increases in the third quarter, the same as in the second quarter.","Let me now turn to CCI markets outside of the U.S., where market acceptance of higher rates continues to lag the United States. In Canada, average renewal rates were up by low single digits in the third quarter, which was down slightly from the second quarter. In Europe, average renewal rates were up by low single digits in the third quarter, matching what occurred in the second quarter of the year. CCI continued to obtain rate increases in Australia, along with some of our other markets in Asia. Average renewal rates in Latin America were flat in the third quarter.","CCI's third quarter U.S. renewal retention was 84%, identical to the second quarter of this year. Continued strong renewal rate increases and solid retention aided CCI's quarterly premium growth, while new business was also up slightly. CCI's new-to-lost business ratio in the U.S. remained at 0.9:1 in the third quarter, identical to the second quarter of the year. Midterm endorsement and premium audits were slightly positive but did not have a significant impact on this quarter's growth, while renewal exposure change was slightly negative.","At Chubb Specialty Insurance, net written premiums declined 4% in the third quarter to $640 million and the combined ratio was 91.9% compared to 88.3% in the year earlier third quarter. For the professional liability portion of CSI, net written premiums were down 5% to $567 million and the combined ratio was 97%, slightly improved from the first 6 months when it was 98.2%. In the third quarter of 2011, the combined ratio for professional liability was 92.5%.","We are pleased that average renewal rates for professional liability in the U.S. increased by 8% in the third quarter, continuing the positive momentum that began in the fourth quarter of last year. The 8% increase in the third quarter was the strongest quarterly renewal rate increase since 2003 and compares to a 7% increase in the second quarter of this year and negative 1% in the third quarter of 2011. In each of our professional liability lines of business in the United States, average renewal rates increased in the third quarter. Increases were led by a private company D&O, which experienced average rate increases in the mid teens, followed by EPL, crime, not-for-profit D&O, public D&O, E&O and fiduciary.","In markets outside of the U.S., average renewal rates for professional liability improved modestly in the third quarter, with average increases in the low single digits. Renewal premium retention for professional liability in the third quarter was 82% in the U.S., identical to the second quarter. The new-to-lost business ratio for professional liability in the U.S. was 0.6:1 compared to 0.7:1 in the second quarter of the year.","While professional liability submissions have increased, we remain steadfast in quoting prices to potential new customers that will earn an adequate return. As we discussed in last quarter's call we are willing to accept the decline in new professional liability business and overall growth as we reprofile the book for improved profitability.","Regarding the surety portion of our CSI book, net written premiums in the third quarter were up 3% to $73 million and the combined ratio was 55.8%.","And with that, I will turn it over to Dino, who will review our Personal lines results as well as corporate-wide claims.","Dino E. Robusto","Thanks, Paul. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 3% in the third quarter to $1.1 billion. CPI produced a combined ratio of 82.8% compared to 115.6% in the corresponding quarter last year. The impacts of catastrophes on CPI's third quarter was 1.5 points in 2012, whereas, last year, we had a third quarter catastrophe total of 28.5 points. On an x cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 81.3% in the third quarter of this year compared to 87.1% in the third quarter of 2011, reflecting continued strong underwriting performance across all geographies and product lines.","Homeowners premiums grew 3% for the quarter and the combined ratio was 76.2% compared to 126.1% in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for only 2.4 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 44.7 points in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding tax, the third quarter homeowners combined ratio was a very strong 73.8% in 2012, a 7.6-point improvement over the same period a year ago when it was 81.4%.","Roughly half of the improvement in the x cat combined ratio reflects the fact that we had fewer non-cat weather-related losses than we had in the third quarter a year ago. Non-cat weather-related losses in the U.S. in the third quarter of this year accounted for about 3.5 points of the homeowners combined ratio compared to about 7 points in the year ago third quarter.","Personal auto premiums declined 2% because the negative impact of currency translation more than offset the increase in premiums in local currencies. Personal auto is a relatively small book of business for us, but a large portion outside the U.S., so it can be heavily influenced by currency fluctuation. Excluding the currency impact, premiums outside the U.S. increased as did premiums in the U.S., consistent with the growth rate in recent quarters. The combined ratio for personal auto improved to 92%, more than 7 points better than the third quarter a year ago when it was 99.3%.","In other Personal lines, premiums were up 8%, driven by strong growth in our accident and personal excess liability lines. The combined ratio for other personal improved to 95.5% from 97.6% in the third quarter a year ago. In the U.S., the third quarter of 2012 was the eighth consecutive quarter of growth in policy accounts for both homeowners and personal auto. At the end of the quarter, policy count per homeowners was 1% higher than a year earlier and for auto, it was 3% higher. Policy retention was consistent with the second quarter of this year at 91% for homeowners and 89% for auto. In short, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Personal lines.","Turning now to claims, corporate-wide. In the third quarter of 2012, the impact of catastrophe losses was $17 million before tax, accounting for 0.6 points of the combined ratio. $17 million reflects $33 million of losses before tax from third quarter cat events in the U.S., primarily Hurricane Isaac, partially offset by downward revisions to our estimated losses from catastrophes in the first half of 2012. Development of catastrophes prior to 2012 had no significant impact.","In the third quarter of 2011, we had cat losses of $420 million before taxes, accounting for 14.4 percentage points of the combined ratio. For the first 9 months of 2012, catastrophe losses were $264 million before tax or 3 points of the combined ratio. This compares with $1 billion or 11.7 points in the first 9 months of 2011.","Now, I'll turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail.","Richard G. Spiro","Thanks, Dino. As you've already heard, we had an excellent third quarter. Looking first at our operating results, we had strong underwriting income of $418 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 7% to $297 million in the quarter due primarily to lower reinvestment rates in both our domestic and international fixed maturity portfolios. The impact of foreign currency translation also had a negative impact on our investment results. Going forward, we expect property and casualty investment income after tax to decline in the fourth quarter as well as next year as we continue to reinvest maturing securities at much lower reinvestment rates.","Net income was the same as operating income in the quarter as net realized gains from the sale of securities were offset by net realized losses from our alternative investment. For comparison, in the third quarter of 2011, we had net realized investment gains before tax of $71 million or $0.16 per share after tax. As a reminder, we account for our alternative investments on a quarter lag because the time required to receive updated valuations from the investment managers of limited partnerships. Accordingly, our alternative investment results for the third quarter reflected the negative global equity market performance in the second quarter. Our fourth quarter 2012 results will reflect market performance in the third quarter, which was more favorable.","Unrealized depreciation before tax at September 30, 2012, increased by $352 million in the quarter to $3.2 billion. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $44.1 billion as of September 30, 2012. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.6 years, and the average credit rating is AA2.","We also continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At September 30, our holding company portfolio included $2.2 billion of investments, including approximately $560 million of short-term investments. Book value per share under GAAP at September 30, 2012, was $60.99 compared to $56.15 at year end 2011 and $55.25 a year ago. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculated with available-for-sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $53.96 compared to $50.37 at 2011 year end, and $50.13 a year ago.","As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the third quarter of 2012 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CPI, we had approximately $25 million; CCI had $70 million; CSI had $35 million; and reinsurance assumed had $15 million, bringing the total favorable development to approximately $145 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the third quarter combined ratio of about 5 points overall. For comparison, in the third quarter of 2011, we had about $155 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $5 million in CPI, $95 million in CCI, $45 million in CSI and $10 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the third quarter of 2011 was also about 5 points. For the third quarter of 2012, our x cat accident year combined ratio was a very strong 90.6% compared to 93.4% in last year's third quarter.","During the third quarter, our loss reserves increased by $20 million, including an increase of $53 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $33 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The overall increase in reserves reflects a decrease of about $140 million related to catastrophe and the impact of currency translation in loss reserves during the quarter resulted in an increase in reserves of about $60 million.","Turning to capital management. During the third quarter, we repurchased 4.1 million shares at an aggregate cost of $301 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $73.80 per share. For the first 9 months of the year, we repurchased 12.7 million shares for a total of $907 million, with an average cost of $71.23 per share. As of September 30, 2012, we had $357 million available for share repurchases under our current authorization and as we have said previously, we intend to complete this program by the end of January 2013.","Let me conclude with a few comments on the revised guidance we announced in today's press release. Based on the low level of catastrophe losses in the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are revising our 2012 full year operating income per share guidance to a range of $6.70 to $6.80 from the previous guidance range of $5.70 to $5.95. This revised guidance is based on operating income per share of $5.04 in the first 9 months and a range of $1.66 to $1.76 for the fourth quarter.","The revised guidance assumes 2 percentage points of cats for the fourth quarter, which would result in 2.7 points of cats for the calendar year. This compares to the full year cat assumption of 4.3 points included in our previous guidance, the decrease being due to the lower-than-expected cat in the third quarter. The impact on operating income per share of each point of cat is approximately $0.28 for the full year and approximately $0.07 for the fourth quarter. The revised guidance is also based on an assumption of 271 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year, unchanged from our previous guidance.","And now, I'll turn it back to John.","John D. Finnegan","Thanks, Ricky. Let me summarize a few of the key highlights of the third quarter. We had operating income of $533 million or a record $1.98 per share. Our annualized ROE was 13.5% and annualized operating ROE was 15.5%. We produced an x cat combined ratio of 85.7 and an x cat accident year combined ratio of 90.6%.","Capital value per share at September 30, 2012, was $60.99, up 10% from a year earlier and up 9% from year end 2011. We repurchased $301 million of common shares and paid $110 million in dividends, and we continued to secure rate increases in all 3 business units, maintaining upward momentum on an earned premium basis. For the first 9 months of 2012, operating income totaled $1.4 billion. On a per-share basis, operating income for the first 9 months was $5.04 per share, a 44% increase over last year, and the highest 9-month operating income per share in Chubb history.","Annualized operating ROE for the first 9 months was 13.4%. And for the first 9 months was -- annualized ROE for the first 9 months of 12.3%. The combined ratio for the first 9 months was 90.1% and the x cat combined ratio was 87.1%.","Our strong performance in the first month of the year has enabled us to increase our 2012 operating income per share guidance to a range of $6.70 to $6.80. The midpoint of our revised guidance is $0.92 per share higher than the midpoint of our prior guidance of $5.70 to $5.95.","In summary, we had a great third quarter on top of a very good first half and we continue to be encouraged by marketplace rate trends.","And with that, I'll open the lines to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, CCI insurance pricing appears to have modestly decelerated from 9% to 8%. Should we -- is there a read through there? When you say 2Q, were you talking about the peak for pricing outside of a large industry loss? And switching gears to Professional and Personal lines, if you could also comment on the rate environments and your outlooks there.","Paul J. Krump","Okay. Mike, this is Paul. Yes, I think it's fair to say that in the U.S., CCI renewal rate increase has been in a tight range for the last few quarters, running between 8% and 9%. The slight downtick from the second quarter to the third quarter is really attributable more to business mix differences between the quarters than any change in the marketplace condition. For example, in Q3, we had fewer large commercial real estate property accounts available to be renewed that we had in Q2, and that really is what drove the change. As respect to where rates are going forward, obviously, no one knows for certain. But where we sit the macro factors, which are contributing to the push for rates for the entire P&C industry. The need for rate increases haven't changed, the low reinvestment yields, the years of soft market pricing, we don't see that changing anytime soon. I think that we were fortunate we had a very benign cat quarter as an industry. But no one here, at least in Warren, New Jersey is extrapolating that into the future, and we're going to continue to push for rates very hard. As respect to specialty you asked about, we continue to see a nice momentum there. We continue to work on the book of business, not only from a rate perspective, but also from a re-profiling. Once again, this past quarter, we saw in our 1-star account, which happened to be the tier with the least amount or the most rate need. We had over 35 points of rate in that tier. We only had 65% retention, whereby in the 4- and 5-star accounts, the best accounts, we still took positive rate in the low single digits and had nearly 90% retention. So we're doing a good job of re-profiling that book and it needs to be re-profiled.","John D. Finnegan","I'll just say generally, we don't have final October numbers. We're not going to make any predictions. But what we can say is anecdotal. We have not heard anything in the marketplace that suggest there's a significant change in the credit and the rate environment. And in terms of CPI, we are filing for additional rate increases, so that momentum continues.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And lastly, in regards to the increased 4Q guidance, the math I'm doing points to an expectation for improved margins on an x cat to x prior development basis. Would you agree with at that? And if so, could you comment on what's driving that?","John D. Finnegan","No. Well, there will be no way you could interpolate what x cat actually would be because there's no breakout of favorable development versus accident year. I mean, what we can say is we don't split them up. If you looked at our combined ratio guidance for the fourth quarter, you would see that, first of all, we have 2 points of cats, so that's versus 0.6 points in the third quarter. So clearly, that adversely affects us on a quarterly comparison. And then we're basically, on x cat basis, on a combined ratio, looking at a combined ratio in line with our first half experience, which is a couple of points higher than we had in the third quarter.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So on professional liabilities, it sounds like you're making a pretty substantial progress. One, I wonder if you could just talk -- I'll pose my question in this, but I wonder if you give us some color as to what you're seeing in terms of new claims reports and severities on the open claims, and basically give us an update on the issues you identified last year that led you to raise your loss picks and sort of sound the alarm bell. And then also, would love to more broadly get your sense of what kind of guidance you're giving to your brokers, and ultimately through the broader community around 1-1 renewals on D&O. And how much rate, maybe not so much you think, that the market will bear, because that's speculative, but how much rate would Chubb like to take?","Dino E. Robusto","Okay. I'll start with a little bit of insight on the claim activity, on the professional liability, give you a little general overview. In terms of professional liability, newer [ph] count increased about 6% in the quarter, and about 3% for the 9 months of 2012 and these increases are largely attributable to EPL, which was up about 23% for the quarter and 18% for the 9 months. Now the increase in EPL claim counts has been a multi-year trend, principally reflecting the ongoing employment practices and administrative charges. Other than EPL, professional liability renewal [ph] counts are actually down 11%, both for the quarter and for the first 9 months. And then -- and just in terms of severity for professional liability, we obviously look at severity a little bit differently than we do, say auto or homeowners, where you have a large number of existing claims. Here, what we're looking at, our leading indicators, such as security class action filings. And on that front, based on new filings for the industry in the first 9 months, it appears that traditional security class actions activity on an annualized basis is at a comparable level to last year, which is up from the historical lows we saw a couple of years ago. And given that the security class action activity has historically been the driver of our public and financial institution D&O loss, this is clearly a trend we watch carefully. On the EPL that I referenced that was up on account, when you look at it from a severity standpoint at the length of time to find a job that has increased, the damage is asserted primarily back pay and  defense costs have increased. However, it's important to note that the majority of the filings we are seeing that is driving the increased claim count are lower severity cases. So that's just a little bit of detail on the personal liability trend. Paul?","Paul J. Krump","Yes. Josh, this is Paul. I'll try to add some color then about -- I guess it was really -- what we're thinking about as respect to 1-1 renewals and what are we talking to our field people about. I think we have alluded to this in the past that we think first about a product line and the dynamics that we talked about before. Some of the issues around D&O and EPL and crime are certainly still with us as we go into 1-1. But then what we really do, Josh, is we make it very granular. We look at it by geography, by SIC type, we put it through our tiering proprietary models, and we take it down to an individual policy level. We look at that account and we ask ourselves, what is the starting point for the rate? How does that compare to like kind and quality within our book? How well has that individual account been running? And we set a target rate increase or maybe it might even be flat, depending on how well it's performing, as we go into the season. So while we do have overall targets, it's really very granular when we take it out to talk to our field staff and with the agents. And then when we talk to the agents, we make certain that we talk to them about a lot of their accounts that are coming up so that they don't misread any signal on a particular accounts as -- meaning, as it impacts their entire book of business. So I hope that gives you some flavor of what we're doing.","John D. Finnegan","Generally, we're booking 100 too, so we need a good deal of in increases going into 2012.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. The final question I ask would be on workers comp. It's just you've had a couple of quarters in a row now of pretty substantial growth. I think there's been some explanations before that. But I would love to just get a sense of are you guys expanding your appetite here or it's not so historically been a place you've been focused?","Paul J. Krump","No, I can definitely tell you, we're not expanding our appetite for workers comp. A big part of the growth is driven by rate. Another piece of the growth came in workers compensation from audit premiums and exposure growth. The overall books are a little bit of a decline in exposure. But workers comp had a bit of an exposure in audit growth in it. And I told you, when we -- in my prepared remarks, about the rate increases, workers compensation was in the low double digits, so that gives you a sense of it. As far as new business goes, it was up slightly but our in force count, Josh, is only up 1% in workers compensation. So we're sticking to our knitting. We're trying to see some opportunities there. But really, it's being rate driven, which is exactly what we want to see.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jay Gelb of Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First one for Ricky. Given the continued impact of low interest rates on investment income, what do you think the after-tax annualized yield on the portfolio could be a year from now, if rates stay at current levels, with it being 3.08% in the third quarter of '12?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes, Jay. I don't know that I can give you an exact number. I guess what I can tell you, as we sit here today, as we think about reinvestment rates and where we're putting money to work today, it obviously varies by asset class. On average, we're reinvesting our maturing securities at about 175 basis points lower than the maturing book yields. And in our 10-K, you have a maturity schedule of our fixed income securities, so that would give you some sense of what would happen to yield over time.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that -- is that 175 below -- you're talking about the after-tax yield or is that pre-tax?","Richard G. Spiro","Pre-tax, I believe. It's pre-tax.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. And then the second one, and I know we've discussed this before, is the pace of the buybacks. You chose on buying $300 million of stock back a quarter, which is on track to be well below the buyback pace in 2011 or 2010, despite the level of operating earnings being at least as high as those prior 2 years. So I'm just trying to understand what Chubb is doing with the excess capital it's retaining if not buying back stock.","Richard G. Spiro","Sure. Well, look. I'd just say we're on course to complete our buyback by the end of January. Let me give you a brief word of explanation, because when put this program in place back in January, we gave some idea that when we thought about our buyback, we we're looking at our operating income less shareholder dividends as a general guideline for us as we make our buyback decision, not a precise level at which we buyback shares in a given year. So when we set the initial buyback target of $1.2 billion back in January, at that point, we were projecting 2012 operating income in the amount of about $1.5 billion and shareholder dividends of about $400 million. So still at that time, we said that we'd be buying back about $100 million more than our forecasted operating income less shareholder dividend. Obviously, as you point out, our forecast has gone up. We're now expecting about $1.8 billion in operating income for the year. And when you take out our shareholder dividends, we're now going to have about $200 million more than our buyback program. So we have no intention of increasing our 2012 buyback program at this time beyond what we said originally. This excess $200 million in net retained earnings will going into our year end capital position and it will be one of the factors going into the consideration of our buyback program for 2013. You might recall that our year end capital position will also be affected by the impact of interest rates on our investment portfolio, the change on our pension position due to returns and lower interest rates and the impact of the currency on the carrying [ph] value of our balance sheet among other things. So the resulting excess capital position will be our starting point in the development of our 2013 share buyback program. We'll then factor in, among other things, overall market conditions, our expected earnings in dividend, part of our stock price valuation, alternative investment opportunities and potential opportunities for profitable growth, coupled with the final level of any stock buyback program. So bottom line is we continue to think we're in a very strong excess capital position and we'll take all that into consideration as we head into 2013.","Dino E. Robusto","Basically, our baseline position is that the buybacks should be in about the amount of income less shareholder dividends. A couple of years ago, we're opportunistic and bought back more shares than that. You had a very attractive price valuation. We continue to like the value of our stock, but that was an opportunistic plight. And it doesn't -- it's obvious that you cannot buy back a lot more shares than your increase in return earnings from net incomes over a long period of time. I mean, that can only be an opportunistic plight.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I see. You have a lot of high-class problems here. With the stock trading at 135% of book, does that give you any pause on the valuations side?","John D. Finnegan","We think it's still an attractive valuation. But of course, when we look at it in 2010 at 110% of book, it looks like a more attractive valuation and we did have a significant excess capital position and took advantage of that opportunity. 135% is about our historical average over the last 10 years. So it's high compared to where it's been in the last few years. But over time, it's not particularly high.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I want to play devil's advocate a little bit here and talk about some of the lines that look like they're at [indiscernible] like surety and some of the commercial lines of business, multi-tier and casualty. Should we be thinking of lower rate increases and faster growth, given that your cat rate adequacy? Or is this something [indiscernible] that should be more complicated than that?","John D. Finnegan","How are you deriving your conclusions as to the rate adequate based upon current period combined ratio?","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Could you just give me -- yes, I mean, this year, as the combined ratio so far through those lines are really quite good, knock on wood. And you put through a fairly substantial rate this year. As we think of next year, not necessarily this quarter, how do you think -- maybe I'll ask it another way, how do you think of that trade-off of trying to get through rate in an environment where you can get rates versus trying to grow?","John D. Finnegan","I think I'm going to let Paul answer this. I don't think you can necessarily -- beyond analysis by just looking at the current combined ratio will get you there. I mean, we have to look at what favorable development there, what's the cat rate is there, what's the related impact to their -- but -- and the new money impact that will lower investment income which is coming in. So Paul, why don't you talk about it a little?","Paul J. Krump","Yes, sure, John. I'll try to frame it out here a little bit. But Paul, things for the question. And I surely appreciate you playing devil's advocate on it. Maybe just taking a step back. When we think about rate adequacy, we start by a product line, we will modify it by geography, industry segment, a lot of subsets of those. And the analyses are constantly revised as new data becomes available. We look at stuff like loss projections, claim costs, payout patterns, frequency trends, as well as what the pricing direction and what our field might be telling us about, terms and conditions, et cetera. And while I greatly appreciate that you've noticed we made a solid progress towards our goals, as evidenced by the excellent third quarter results, I caution you just to remember that in the third quarter in particular, the results include significant favorable development. You got investment income there that still reflects a higher embedded yield, as well as obviously unusually low cap. And then when you think about it on an accident year basis, the overall book is not currently at adequate rate levels to achieve what we consider our long-run normalized cat load combined ratio target. So we're looking at a lot of stuff. One of the other factors we have to think about all the time is the pressure for loss costs, where the trend is at by line and if you should just think about commercial in general, pick a number, we could debate it. But we tend to think around maybe 4% is a loss cost trend on the book of business. That means we, as underwriters, have to step up every year and get at least 4% on average just to tread water. So that's a force that you're out with swimming again, so to speak. So hopefully that gave you some sense. We've made good progress, but bottom line, we think we've got a ways to go.","J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So could -- focus this a little bit in my mind. It sounds like you believe that you still need to take your current book and make it more profitable overall. And so the focus is going to continue to be on trying to get rate as opposed to growth.","John D. Finnegan","Yes. Well, let's look at it this way. I think if you did an analysis -- now, let's talk about the macro and then you can move to the individual lines. It's a little different, but if you did an analysis, a rigorous analysis of what our overall book has generated on an accident year basis with normalized cats, our overall business, you'd still be lucky to get the double digits. I mean, we obviously are benefiting from very low cats this quarter and still a good deal of favorable development. Now so with all of the industry, and the industries if we're at the high single digits, the industry is well below that. So from an overall perspective, we're not rate adequate. Now are some lines that are better than others? Of course, and we undertake continuously analyses of each of the lines, of what kind of rates we need in each of the lines and the profitability versus their growth trade-off. And that's sort of at a granular level that we do here and in the field, so each line is different. And then as you -- but as Paul mentioned, that even if you got the rate adequacy, the day you stop and don't get any more rate, your 4% is inadequate the following year. So you need rate over the time. We don't have a lot of lines that are excessively profitable. We have a few that may be rate adequate, but overall, you'd have to say that an accident year basis with a full cat load and normal weather-related activity, we're not at target ROEs for the book as a whole.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is on the accident year margins. You mentioned that there was some benefit from lower than average non-cat weather. So was this quarter's non-cat weather margin kind of normal? And the reason I asked is, historically, the accident year loss ratio x cat is worse than the second half of the year versus the first half, and this year, we actually saw the reversal.","John D. Finnegan","Let me talk -- what I say is this, Vinay. We had a good quarter. Margin expansion is usually defined as the amount at which rate increase would exceed longer-term loss trends. It's kind of a hypothetical calculation at any given quarter. You never have a longer-term loss trends or something else. But if you look at where our third quarter result came from -- if you talk about earned premium, which is what gets into income, we were close to margin neutral in the third quarter in CPI and CSI and had about 2 points of margin expansion in CCI hypothetically. So by itself, it's a positive development, but not sufficient not to own [ph] to explain the third quarter accident results, so the 3-point overall improvement from the third quarter 2011. Where did it come from? A little bit from that, the margin expansion CCI perhaps, but more of that the actual losses in the quarter were below the regression line, between the -- below the long-term trend line. We'd like to think that, that's a largely attributable excellent underwriting on our part and maybe in part it is, but we also recognize there is some good fortune involved. And one of the pieces of good fortune, what we use as an example, there are other pieces that is non-cat related weather. That's primarily a Personal lines thing with a little bit of rollup to commercial property and multiple parallel lines. But for example, to give you an idea, in our homeowners business, non-cat U.S. related losses ran about 3.5 points in the third quarter versus 7 points in the third quarter of 2011 and about 6 points in the third quarters over the last 5 years. As you look forward, and I know all you will try to do this, you'd look at -- we might, at the continued rate levels, we might have theoretically 3 points of margin expansion in 2013 over all our businesses. But you have to remember, we're starting with a very favorable loss period. So it'd be kind of simplistic just to extrapolate that expansion. It would assume that extra loss experienced in the quarter will continue below longer-term cost trends for the next year, a possible but not probable assumption. And a more realistic assumption might include -- while setting the margin expansion, it's a little bit -- by some reversion to the mid and higher losses from a variety of areas. So margin analysis is a good forecasting tool. But you got to look at where the base period is, you got to look at the actual versus the theoretical. And then finally, when you look at income forecast, you got to recognize the margin expansion, it generally applies only to accident year results, it doesn't affect favorable development. And that's another major component of counting their results in order to take into account changes in investment income, of course.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Could you help us understand what rate increases you're looking for on the homeowners line?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes. We're in the process now of filing homeowner rate increases that vary by state, of course. In the mid single-digit and above level, with targeted effective dates in the next 2 quarters. And I use the word targeted just because they're still subject to regulatory approval. But that's the range we're looking at.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And just one last thing, if I may. On the net investment income, I believe, last quarter, it was said that the new yields on the tax-exempt securities are between 125 to 150 basis points lower. And on the taxable securities, it's about 250 basis points lower. So just wondering if it still holds or if it's -- I mean, or the new money is even worse now than it was last quarter.","Richard G. Spiro","The new money rates are a little bit worse than they were last quarter. So as we sit here now on the muni side, we're probably looking at roughly 160 basis points lower. On the domestic taxable side, we're looking at about 300 basis points lower, and then on our non-U.S. fixed income investments, we're are looking at about 150 basis points lower. And as I mentioned in a prior comment, if you're look at it on average, it's probably around 175 basis points across the portfolio.","John D. Finnegan","And then you can see that contraction in spreads and the mirror image of it is the improvement in the position of unrealized position, which increased substantially over the quarter, due [ph] in part to equities and part due to the fact that spreads came in.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mike Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Just a couple of questions. One, in CCI, it looked like the underlying loss ratio was a lot lower. And specifically CMP, the underlying combined was pretty low and marine, it looked pretty low. Is there some lumpiness that kind of -- I think someone made a comment before about -- in CPI that there was a lack of lumpiness. Is that part of the reason for that? Or is there something else and just one follow-up.","Paul J. Krump","This is Paul, Mike. I think it's really -- when you look at it, it's probably the impact of cat.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So it's just cat. So there's nothing even on an underlying basis that really had an impact there?","John D. Finnegan","Yes, I mean, obviously, there's some improvement, yes. But our accident year, x cat results and CCI, were improvement, definitely, I mean, in all of our lines of business. Remember last year, it was a huge quarter for cats, so you can't -- the third quarter, so you -- but the published results, that is so misleading that you really can't draw much from those.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, but even if -- yes, I mean, I guess even if you compare going back, I mean, it's a unique result. So I was just curious if there was -- non-cat weather was a driver as well.","John D. Finnegan","No. I mean, I don't think that much. I think that cats were unusually low. And we also had very favorable x cat results in our commercial lines. It's -- we've had good loss trends this year. And now you go back a few years and we had better results, but these are very good.","Paul J. Krump","Mike, it's that the property model prop, package prop, has been leading the rate parade for us for the last 5 quarters, so you're seeing that start to earn and sway a little bit, too.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then could you give a little bit more breakdown in terms of the development by -- either by accident year or maybe just within CCI, by product type or just maybe some general notion of where the development came from?","Richard G. Spiro","Sure. I would happy to do that. So I'll go through each of this SPUs and then I'll give you as much color as I can. I'll start with CPI, where we had about $25 million of favorable development. In CPI, all 3 of the lines of business, homeowners, auto and other personal, were slightly favorable in the quarter. When you look at CCI, where we had the $70 million, it was driven largely by our casualty book and our commercial multi tier [ph] book was also favorable. Workers comp was close to flat, and property, marine actually was slightly adverse. And then in CSI, with $35 million of favorable development, the vast majority of the favorable was in the professional liability lines driven by D&O and fiduciary and it was partially offset by some small adverse development in crime, fidelity, E&O and EPO, reflecting the some of the trends that we've already talked about.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And accident years, is it recent years or older years, just generally or...","Paul J. Krump","Primarily 2008 and prior.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Matthew Heimermann of JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question I had was just, if I think about guidance at the start of the year and adjusting for cat and then all these other changes I have kind of a midpoint of about $0.70 higher than where you started. My question is relative to the base cases you had at the beginning of the year, where were you -- what areas were you positively surprised in? And I guess I was thinking kind of -- how much of it was better development, how much of it was perhaps better lost trend which you alluded to earlier? How much of it was maybe a little bit better rate and therefore a little bit better accident year priced margin and maybe a thought...","John D. Finnegan","I'll answer that. The answer is that it was better than anticipated loss trends but loss trends, unlike rate impact both accident year and prior period development, so there's no breakup of that. It was just -- we had better loss trends. Now a couple of factors. First, when we came into 2012, we were developing this guidance based on what were pretty -- what were tougher third and fourth quarters of 2011. We were concerned that the benign loss trends of the prior 5 years had turned. And while we didn't extrapolate those worse loss trends, we certainly adjusted and increased them over the first half of 2011. Now it's turned out is that this year, it's looked a lot like the first half of 2011, loss trends have been better than that. So I think and that's been reflected in better -- in good development and in better accident year results. I don't know versus rate. I think the rates are -- they may be a little bit better than we thought we had. Again, at that time, we weren't getting these type of rate increases, so we thought to build in. We were trying to achieve higher rate increases, but we didn't have them yet, so obviously, you have to blend in the realistic with the desired. So net-net, I just think the loss trends were the -- had been the answer. And in part, that's -- maybe third and fourth quarter last year was an anomaly. In part, that's due to things that are explainable but like non-cat-related weather.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess that leads to another question. This is a little bit of a crystal ball question, but the theme of the last 10 years since we've been -- well, maybe not 10, let's say 8, has been we've been surprised by how good loss trend has been. How much credibility do you put in a scenario where you're able to get rate the next couple of years and you do that to reflect loss trend, low rates, but also maybe there's, built into that, an expectation that the development we've seen can't last. But how much credibility would you give to a scenario where perhaps we continue to be surprised by the loss trend side and the development and what it means for priced ROEs?","John D. Finnegan","I don't think I can answer that. I mean, the loss trends are developed by the actuaries, to take into account, historical experience, recent experience, but they're longer term in nature. I don't know. I hope you're right. I hope that scenario plays out. But we just use the historical data and go from there. I mean, we're not willing to say that loss trends have gone from 4% to 2% or anything like that.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick one on property. Is that probably the line you'd point to where you might expect to see some moderation in pricing now that it looks like some of the reinsurance cost pushes has been collected?","John D. Finnegan","Talk to us after next week's storm. No, the answer is I don't know. So far, it's holding up, but we'll see.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Dino, we've talked a lot about margins. And well, I guess I'm looking at the consensus number and my level is pretty close to consensus, and the only way we can get to the fourth quarter is, I think, by basically all bringing up our margin assumptions by 200 to 300 basis points. So my question is how sustainable are the current trends because obviously, if you good on that line item into the fourth quarter and the year-over-year improvement should probably just hold all through next year as well. Is that a reasonable assumption?","Dino E. Robusto","Well. All I could say about the fourth quarter in terms of what you could read into it is the fact that we're assuming a combined ratio of about 2 points higher than the third quarter but about in line with the first half of this year. So I mean, that's where we are on an x cat basis. On an x cat basis, of course, and then we have cats about 1.5 point better. So that's the answer to one. I don't know -- what was your other?","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","More -- because again, where consensus is versus what you're guiding to, it's all pointing to better margin, as you just said, better than what we're expecting. And so what I'm wondering is, is how this plays into next year's numbers as well? I'm trying to think about the improvement, because you've now got way on top of rate, the loss trend is more benign, you seem a little more confident -- well, you seem very much more confident in some of the problem areas that you were highlighting a year ago. So it just seems like the trend on core margins is going to be better.","John D. Finnegan","Greg, I see where you're going. I mean, what we've seen is that the loss trend, the margins in the third quarter were much better than were embedded in the analyst forecast. The margin implicit -- and margin's a loose term. Margin used to refer to accident year. I mean, we're predicting results in the fourth quarter, and they aren't quite as good as the third quarter but are better than the first half. So are they sustainable? I think what I said before was we expect some margin expansion next year. But on the other hand, we're starting from a very benign base in a variety of areas. In some areas, we're hoping to improve our loss experience like some of the professional liability areas where with the crime areas, for example, where we've had some problems. But we shall see. But in then some other areas, our experience in personal and commercial has been so good especially in non cat-related weather. That one more thing some [ph] version mean we do there. So I -- And finally, when you look at the results next year, rate doesn't impact favorable development so that's a wildcard, and we don't how much prior period development we'll have. So that's the context. You have some things working for you in terms of what we expect better rates that are earned premium. You have somethings may be working against you, some reversion to the mean in the loss trends even if it's slightly. And then you have the uncertainty of prior period development and you have lower interest rates.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. It's just trying to get to kind of what we were thinking versus what you guys are now -- again, it's the guidance that we're getting. It's a lot more bullish than what I think some of us at least were thinking. So if I could just back up in your commentary, I think during the call and I want to make sure I got this correct, did you say that there's 350 basis points of non cat benefit in the quarter? Was that the correct number? I know we've been talking about this in the Q&A, but I just want to kind of nail them, that number. Was it 350 basis points in this particular quarter?","John D. Finnegan","Greg, it's -- 350 basis points versus last year, about 250 basis points for the average of the last 5 years in the homeowners business, so on our total results, that obviously is closer to 100 basis points. I mean, it's not the deal so just to give you a feel. And again to your comment, Greg, that what we're guiding to the fourth quarter is better than you're carrying, well, we have the advantage of knowing the third quarter results when we develop that guidance. If you -- if we hadn't given you any guidance and you'd seen our third quarter results, you probably would've improved your expected combined ratio based on those results too.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. Okay, okay, And then John, again, just so -- is it 150 basis points then? That's the figure -- I totally, so I did -- I'm glad I clarified it. It's 350 for the homeowners line, it's 150 benefit this particular quarter for the overall corporation?","John D. Finnegan","That's about 2.5. That 2.5 over 12 and then that's -- is that worldwide, Dino?","Dino E. Robusto","Yes.","John D. Finnegan","That's worldwide. So it's 2.50 [ph] to us, probably 178 [ph] To take homeowners and divide homeowners into total premium and then multiply that by the 350, that will give you the idea or versus last year 250 versus normal maybe.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And really what I'm doing is I'm going to add that back in, look at the year-over-year. It's going to show some margin improvement. I'm still going to end up with a lot of margin improvement next quarter and sort of then I have to decide what to do next year. But okay, I'll keep settling with it, but it looks like you guys have had a pretty good inflection.","John D. Finnegan","Yes. And remember that non cat-related weather is one good example to use it again. We had just very good favorable loss experience in all of our lines this year.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just 2 questions. The first is given that the claims trends had been better than you had expected earlier in the year, in the third quarter, was there any favorable development from the first half of the year that flowed into the 3Q?","John D. Finnegan","No. Not that we've -- we've said in the past, we don't really -- I mean, cats aside, we don't really show -- we don't really break it up that way. I don't know. Nothing material as far as we can tell, no.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, given the very strong capital position going into next year, and given that the fact that the stock is -- has moved up on a price-to-book basis, you look at the dividend and it's been gradually moving up relatively slowly. Would it make sense at this point to speed up that acceleration from a dividend standpoint?","John D. Finnegan","Let me caveat before Ricky says anything. That decision might depend upon where the taxes come out. [indiscernible] It's 20% or 40% but go ahead, Ricky.","Richard G. Spiro","Jay, all I can say at this point obviously, we'll re-look at our dividend with our board in the normal course. As you know, we've increased our dividend in each of the past 30 years. We'll take a number of factors into consideration including our capital position, as John said, the tax environment. And hopefully, we've shown you over the years we're committed to return our excess capital to our shareholders, and dividends are an important part of that strategy. Having said that, I'm not going to make any comment about what our future dividend plans may or may not be.","Operator","We will take our next question from Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","When we look at claims specifically relating to medical care, is there any change in the trend there?","Paul J. Krump","No. Not really. It's been pretty well stable, and it clearly runs higher than the typical consumer price index, and so we see at it as the same.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick one here. Going back to the whole share repurchase. Rick and John, do you ever think about share buyback with respect to kind of a payback period? Because obviously, you're buying back your stock at $1.35 [ph] of book value, 1 3 [ph]. It takes a while to earn that dilution book value per share back, particularly given this low interest rate environment.","Richard G. Spiro","Brian, it's Ricky. We look at it a bunch of different ways. We do look at payback. We do look at different return analyses. And as John said fairly on, even at today's stock price and our current price-to-book value valuation, we still see attractive economic opportunities in repurchasing our shares at our current price. So we do look at all those things. We do take them into consideration. But again, we still think that at today's price, it's still relatively attractive. And don't forget with the low interest rate environment, you also don't have as many other opportunities to invest your money elsewhere and make better return.","John D. Finnegan","Thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference call. Once again, we would like to thank everyone for your participation, and have a wonderful day."],"5099":["Chubb Ltd.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.","Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.","Thank you, and welcome to our June 30, 2016 second quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company and investment portfolio performance, pricing and business mix, economic and insurance market conditions and integration of acquisitions including our acquisition of the Chubb Corporation, and potential synergies, savings and commercial and investment benefits we may realize.

Actual results may differ materially.","Please refer to our most recent SEC filings, as well as our earnings press release and financial supplements which are available on our website, at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.","During today's report, our management will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release and financial supplement.","Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.","And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. As you saw from the numbers we had a pretty good quarter, though we were impacted by the higher level of industry insured cat events globally, 25 of them by our account. After-tax operating income for the quarter was just over $1 billion or $2.25 per share compared to $2.40 per share prior year. For illustrative purposes, excluding cat losses, operating income was $2.91 per share, up 7% over prior year and for six months up 11% demonstrating our excellent underlying operating results which are in line with our expectations and I think depict the accretive nature of our merger.","As I did last quarter when discussing our underwriting results and premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the health of the company, I will compare our results as the new Chubb, excluding the purchase accounting and one-time merger-related items in 2016 that distort underwriting to the 2015 year prior quarter as if we were one company back then or put simply as if. So you know as a manager this is how I look at our results.","So, to begin, the P&C combined ratio for the quarter was a published 91.2% and an as if, which again excludes merger-related items, 90.2%, a really good result that included $311 million in after-tax cat losses from a broad range of events globally. As we recently announced, our cat losses in the quarter were about $100 million above what we had contemplated on a pre-tax basis, but they are in line with our insurance and reinsurance exposures globally. It's worth noting that the level of industry cat losses while elevated when compared to the recent past appear in line with longer-term historical results.","The P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was 88.9% in the quarter versus 88% as if we were one company last year. Last year has the one-time benefit from the Fireman's Fund transaction and excluding that our year-over-year current accident year combined ratio was essentially flat. Both our North American and international insurance operations had very good calendar and current accident year results. Again, on an as if basis, positive prior period reserve development of $301 million pre-tax was down $35 million versus prior year.","Adjusted net investment income for the full quarter was $816 million, a good result given the continued impact of foreign exchange and low interest rates and very modestly below our expectations and guidance to you. Progress, repositioning our portfolio which will result in additional investment income as we discussed last quarter, is on track.","Book value per share was up 2.7% in the quarter and stands at $101.56. For the year, per share book value was up over 13%, our annualized operating ROE is circa 10% year-to-date. Phil will have more to say about the investment portfolio, tangible book value, as well as prior period reserve development in cats.","Turning to premium revenue, total P&C net premiums in the quarter on a constant dollar basis declined 4.7% on an as if basis. Excluding the previously disclosed one-time benefit from the portfolio transfer of Fireman's Fund business last year, total P&C net premiums were down about 1.5%. Commercial P&C net premiums written for North America were flat. International retail P&C was up 1.5%. International wholesale P&C was down 7% and Global Re was down 13%. Net premiums written for North America personal lives were down about 20%, or 5% excluding the one-time Fireman's Fund premium benefit last year. Excluding all of Fireman's Fund, so just imagining legacy ACE and Chubb personal lines, normalized premiums were in fact up.","Given the softer market conditions and the underwriting actions we took due to the consolidation of our two companies, I consider our commercial P&C revenue results this quarter to be reasonably in line with our expectations. As I mentioned on recent calls, when we were planning the merger, we contemplated underwriting actions in certain portfolios not meeting our standards or risk appetite, that would reduce our net premium. These underwriting actions, which include either canceling or reinsuring that business, will improve our risk\/reward profile and will continue this year and into 2017. In addition, we are choosing to utilize a greater level of reinsurance in certain classes. Altogether, these actions impacted net premium growth in the quarter by about 1.5 points.","On the flip side of the coin, the strength of the combined organization, including cross-selling and the introduction of our total product portfolio to an expanded distribution base is beginning to show, and this contributed about 1.5 points of net premium growth in the quarter or about 13% of our North America retail commercial P&C new business growth.","I'm going to give you some more detail on our revenue results and pricing by major division, beginning with North America. In our retail commercial P&C business that serves the middle market, net premiums were up 1.2%, with a renewal retention rate as measured by premium of 89.3%. The market continued to gradually soften. Overall renewal pricing was up about 0.5% in the quarter. General and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 0.9%, with workers comp down over 2% and general liability down 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was up 1% and property-related pricing was down 0.5%.","Terms and conditions are generally holding, though we are noticing some erosion around the margins. New business writings for our middle market business were up 2% year-on-year. In our business serving large corporate customers and specialty E&S markets, what we call major accounts and specialty, net premiums were down just under 1%, with major accounts down 1% and Westchester E&S up 0.5%.","For our retail major accounts business, the renewal retention rate as measured by premium was 90.6%. We are continuing to experience downward pressure on pricing; however, for lead layers, both primary and excess, where capabilities make a real difference, and there are only a few of us who can stand up to that, pricing conditions are less competitive than straight excess layers, where it's simply about capacity.","Terms are conditions are generally holding in the major accounts customer segment. Pricing for the business we wrote was down 2.5%. General and specialty casualty-related pricing was up 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down about 2.5%, particularly large account D&O, and property-related pricing was down 10%.","New business writings on a gross premium basis were up in the quarter about 23%, driven largely by risk management, primary and lead excess, environmental liability and cash flow property, which by the way has very little net premium associated with it. The new business growth is a combination of flight to quality and a few major competitors exiting or reducing their exposures.","In our North America personal lines business, normalized premiums were up about one point for the combined ACE and Chubb book of business, excluding Fireman's Fund. Overall rates were up 1.3% and exposure change was a positive 3.4%. Retentions remained quite strong, driven by the legacy Chubb and legacy ACE portfolios at over 95%. For the legacy Fireman's Fund portfolio, retentions were lower at 72%, driven by rate and non-renewal actions as we continue to convert the business to Chubb paper and some producers and customers choose instead to move to a cheaper, and in our judgment underpriced, option. These are a continuation of the actions we have taken since the start of the conversion last summer.","Looking forward, and for your information, effective July 1, we have purchased additional reinsurance protection for our North America personal lines business. This will have an annualized impact on net written premium of approximately $250 million. We obtained excellent terms and judge the risk management and financial benefits to be clearly in the interest of the company, resulting in an improved net retained risk\/reward profile.","Net premiums for our agriculture business were down just over 1% in the quarter due to commodity prices, offset by growth in exposure.","Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, as I mentioned earlier, net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were up in the quarter, 1.5% in constant dollar. While in our London market-based excess and surplus lines business, premiums were down 7%, due entirely to market conditions. Growth in our international retail business varied depending on territory and product.","Asia Pacific was up 7%. Latin America was down 5%, mostly due to commercial P&C market conditions and personal lines in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, Latin America grew 1%. And Europe was flat, with the continent up 4% and the U.K. down 4%.","From a product perspective, commercial P&C net premiums grew just over 1%, while personal lines grew 2%. It's worth noting we have chosen to exit the legacy Chubb Brazil high net worth auto business due to underwriting and took actions on this earlier in the year. Excluding that impact, our international personal lines business grew 5%.","Overall renewal pricing, so for the business we wrote, for our international commercial P&C business was down 3%, consistent with our expectations and a stable, in fact slower, rate of decline relative to the 15-year. Property prices were down 5%, casualty was down 3% and financial lines were down 2%. Terms and conditions were largely in line with previous quarters.","In our global A&H business, net premiums written in constant dollars were up over 3% in the quarter, including 5% growth in our combined insurance operations in North America. As I mentioned before, while early days, we are beginning to see tangible revenue growth as a result of the power of the new Chubb. We have very focused, deliberate efforts underway around the globe to promote both account cross-selling and product introduction to expanded distribution. We have specific targets and objectives, internal programs to educate colleagues about each other's products and services, and promotional campaigns. Some areas where you've seen early cross-selling success include environmental, healthcare, professional lines, workers comp, specialty casualty, transportation and agriculture, to name a few. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends as well as examples of how the power of the firm is contributing to cross-selling success.","Before I close, we remain on track with all of our integration plans and activities. We are meeting our milestones in terms of integration savings, support function expectations, underwriting and claims initiatives and growth initiatives. Our outstanding claims in risk engineering organization has not missed a beat during the integration, especially in light of the increased level of cats and continue to distinguish the firm in serving both our commercial and personal policyholders. Our people are continuing to knit themselves together and coalesce into one unified culture. In fact, most of our people are spending far less time on integration-related process and procedures and more and more of their time focused on serving their customers and distribution partners.","With all that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll come back and take your questions.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Evan. We've completed the second quarter as a new Chubb and reached two milestones. Our total capital position now exceeds $60 billion and our cash and invested assets now exceed $100 billion. During the quarter, S&P reaffirmed our AA rating and upgraded our outlook from negative to stable and A.M. Best reaffirmed our A++ rating with a stable outlook and removed their Under Review designation. Adjusted investment income of $816 million for the quarter was slightly lower than our expectation because of lower than estimated private equity distributions. As Evan mentioned and as we discussed last quarter, we're on track to reposition the portfolio to enhanced returns without taking significant additional risk.","However, based on the decline in investment deals during the second quarter, we are now expecting consolidated adjusted investment income to be in the range of $820 million to $830 million for the third quarter which compares to our most recent guidance of $830 million. This is subject to volatility in investment yields, prepayments in our mortgage-backed portfolio, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Our portfolio continues to have an average AA rating and a duration of approximately four years. Our current book yield is 3.4% and new money rates are 2.3%. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $830 million pre-tax and include $933 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from the decline in interest rates, a $159 million mark-to-market loss on the VA portfolio, also primarily from the decline in interest rates and a $59 million gain from FX.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.1 billion. Tangible book value per share was up 6.1% reflecting our strong earnings and the net realized and unrealized gains I just mentioned. Net loss reserves increased $269 million for the quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 93%. Adjusted for cat losses and prior period development, the ratio was 89%.","As we announced, our catastrophe losses in the second quarter, net of reinsurance, were $390 million pre-tax or $311 million after-tax. Of the pre-tax total, $320 million was from natural catastrophes in North America, and $70 million was from events outside North America. We've included more details of where these losses were incurred in our supplement. Prior period reserve development was positive $301 million pre-tax and comprised $205 million from long-tail lines, principally from 2011 and prior, and $96 million from short-tail lines.","Our tax rate on operating income for the quarter is 16.7%, which is in the range of the expected annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. Quarterly tax rates will vary based on where our income emerges.","I'll turn the call back over to Helen.","Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.","Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, and thank you. Thanks for all the details on the top line growth. Just wanted to focus on the North American personal P&C insurance. If you're excluding the Fireman's Fund one-time transfer, the overall premium like pro forma is down 5%. I was just wondering is that including sort of the, rather than the transfer for the legacy Fireman's Fund business as you re-underwrite that business and how long will it last? Because you've surely lost some and I just wonder at which point we could reach an inflection point on that?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Kai, I think I answered most of your question in my commentary, because I've said the Fireman's Fund ran a 72% retention rate. That's what impacted that 5% and excluding it we were up 1% and I gave you pricing and exposure numbers. The 72% was due to a couple of things. Non-renewal actions, we actually non-renewed a certain percentage of the portfolio and pricing action we took as we convert to the legacy Chubb\/ACE pricing. When we take an expiring policy on Fireman's Fund paper and literally convert it to ACE or Chubb paper on our pricing, there is a very meaningful pricing differential in the majority of cases and that also impacted renewal retention rates.","There are customers and producers who chose a cheaper option, and by the way, an awful lot of that was contemplated when we actually determined to make the purchase of the Fireman's Fund portfolio. So you have those things. This will continue through the third quarter and in the fourth quarter while it'll continue, it's on a far diminished basis and we expect a substantially higher renewal retention rate because it's on business that's on legacy ACE paper.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. And then the second question on the integration expense savings side. How much of the $275 million you guided for the 2016 was saved in the second quarter?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's about $67 million.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","$67 million, okay.","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then just looking forward, you have these cost savings, by my calculation if you lump them all into the underwriting results, probably come to anywhere between 1 point to 2.5 points of your...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That was your first mistake. You just counted them all into the underwriting.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. So let me rephrase it. I'll just say will these cost savings be enough to overcome the pricing pressure in order for you to maintain that or improve the margin going forward?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you know, that's a forward-looking statement and that's guessing everything that you can imagine about terms and conditions in pricing and renewal retention rates as we go forward. So that's guessing at market conditions. I think it's better to say that \u2013 by the way, the cost savings show up in operating expense line, they show up in the claims line, the portion that is UA (23:43) related, they show up in the acquisition line. So they show up in three different categories.","What it is safe to say is, the expense savings will ameliorate any deterioration in underwriting margins. Whether it offsets it, we'll see how future years look.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, lastly if I may, is there any sort of impact from potential near-term and long-term impact from Brexit? Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There is no near-term, and look, the long-term is going to depend on what's negotiated between the U.K. and the EU, which we don't know. You're all familiar with the term passporting and that would be the biggest impact to us, and in which case if passporting is not negotiated we will have a separate European sub which would have some capital implications. The exact amount I can't tell you, but we'll be able to handle it easily, and it'd have a modest amount of personnel impact as well. Not dramatic. I don't foresee a substantial impact, but let's wait and see what's negotiated.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Just following up on that a bit if I could, Evan, on the personal lines business, it sounds like then the comparisons by year-over-year basis get a little bit easier as the year progresses. There isn't a distortion like we saw in the second quarter. I just want to try to understand if that's exactly right and also how we should be thinking about the net impact on underwriting from the change in reinsurance. Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The change in reinsurance will improve the expense ratio in particular, and I'd say that. I'm not going to give the numbers. The third quarter will have less impact than the second quarter, because we don't have the one-time, and the one-time, the underwriting benefit, we had some in the third quarter and some in the fourth quarter last year as you recall. But it was much larger in the first quarter than in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So you get that, we had that positive pickup that wouldn't repeat in 2016 from Fireman's Fund and we disclosed that to you. And so you have those numbers, and you know those.","The renewal conversion will have less of an impact in the third quarter than in the second quarter, but it'll still have an impact. And the fourth quarter will be dramatically less.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Okay, thanks for that. And then you mentioned Fireman's Fund as far as conversion. Can you talk a little bit about for the legacy ACE clients on the personal lines side? I'm guessing the premium also there will be higher than it was, maybe that's not true but I'm assuming it is. So maybe you could help on that. But has that impacted retention? And then for legacy Chubb agents, has there been any change in commission structure or are their commissions across legacy ACE and Chubb similar? Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So the first part of your question I'm going to answer quickly and then I'm going to turn it over to Paul Krump.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But remember, a legacy ACE customer is renewed on legacy ACE paper. They remain. And a legacy Chubb customer is renewed on legacy Chubb paper. All new business is written on legacy Chubb, rates, terms and paper.","Paul?","Paul J. Krump - Executive Vice President, Chubb Group & President, North America Commercial and Personal Insurance, Chubb Ltd.","Sure, Evan. And maybe just to put a sharper point on that because we do see a little bit of account rounding coming in on ACE paper as well, so somebody might be buying an excess policy above their homeowners and automobile. So there is a small amount of \"new\" business coming on to ACE paper, but that's from account rounding and it's not truly a new customer. You mentioned commissions. There's been really no change in the commission structure whatsoever. Our agents enjoy good commissions and our GSC program is alive and well.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And so do you plan on then maintaining the two separate platforms, so legacy ACE \u2013 so that will continue in perpetuity for legacy ACE insureds? Or is it anticipated at some point you'll have one product, one brand?","Paul J. Krump - Executive Vice President, Chubb Group & President, North America Commercial and Personal Insurance, Chubb Ltd.","For the foreseeable future, we'll have the two platforms. Evan has mentioned in previous calls that we're always looking for new product and we're kicking around how we can improve the current masterpiece, which is really the Cadillac of products out there. And over time we will work on that, and I would foresee at that point that there would be a conversion.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess just to follow up on the reinsurance discussion. We were curious, does the increase in the reinsurance spend allow for a broader strategic growth opportunity? Or does it really just improve the risk profile and profitability of the existing book?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It does both.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Any interest in elaborating further?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. I guess my other follow-up for Evan is just on where we are I guess in terms of tangible book. I noticed tangible equity's grown about $1.6 billion since March, and I think Evan has said in the past that one of his goals with this deal is to get tangible book value, I know it's per share, back to where it was prior to the deal. But we were just wondering, how important is it to get the tangible book value per share back to where it was prior to the deal before considering further deployment of capital, either through M&A or buyback?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Ryan, we're on track to do that. Our own projections when we originally did the deal was, from memory, 3.5 years, or under 3.5 years. Our updated projections hold us right on track with that, and growing tangible is important to us. That's a balance sheet, quality of balance sheet question to us. You can pay claims out of tangible capital and it's your most constraining factor financially, is tangible. So growth in tangible is important to us.","On the other side of the coin, we will generate, depending on if, you can't predict conditions, you can't predict losses precisely, but our own projections, if they hold, we will generate capital flexibility as well. So I think that's about as far as I want to go with that.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So, it's safe to say that if at some point you were comfortable with the risk profile and the rating agencies were comfortable with the risk profile of the business, you'd potentially be willing to extend that 3.5-year goal out further if there were an accretive opportunity?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I am not willing to extend that 3.5-year goal out further. No. That's a misunderstanding. We can achieve that 3.5-year goal and at the same time, we will generate surplus capital.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And capital flexibility. Remember, I called out (32:39) capital flexibility. We like having capital flexibility. That's a good thing, and we're in the risk business and we're also a growth company in terms of book value. We like having capital flexibility on our balance sheet.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Congratulations on a good quarter. I was just wondering, first, if you could just elaborate a bit more on the cross-selling opportunities. I appreciate the marks, but if you could give some specific examples I think that would be really helpful.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. And thank you, Sarah. I'm going to actually ask John Keogh to elaborate on those, and John Lupica or Paul Krump or Juan Andrade may want to pile in.","John W. Keogh - Executive Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer","Sure, and, Sarah, it's John Keogh. Listen, there's a bunch of examples I can give you, and Evan mentioned where we're seeing it in terms of the products. Maybe I'll give you one which I think kind of speaks to the strength of the two companies coming together in a piece of business we wrote this quarter that was worth a couple of million dollars of premium. And it was a relationship that legacy Chubb had, a very strong relationship going back for a number of years through their D&O position as a lead D&O carrier, and also in excess liability. The client is in the nursing home business, a large nursing home chain, legacy Chubb had chosen to stay out of the medical liability business over the years. Legacy ACE, we've been in that business for a long time, know it well, have done well in it. Knowing the client well, knowing the producer well, we went and had a conversation about their coverage for medical liability. Given the relationship they enjoyed with legacy Chubb, they were more than happy to talk to us about that, and that resulted in us writing them medical liability for a couple of million dollars of premium that I think we probably would not have written but for the two companies coming together.","John Joseph Lupica - Vice Chairman, Chubb Limited \/ Chubb Group; President, North America Major Accounts and Specialty Insurance","Sarah, this is John Lupica. If I can just say from a branch and regional office standpoint, it's awesome to see this company come together. We have 48 branches that are really learning from one another and the momentum we're picking up is just terrific. We have policies in place with dual declination, so people get to see each other's opportunities. So we know each other's appetite. The product that ACE is bringing to the table is terrific. The capabilities Chubb's bringing to the table is awesome.","One example is we have a large risk management business out of a satellite office that came from an agent that wasn't even appointed on the ACE producer list. And this agent had a house account that was introduced to the ACE risk management team and our ESIS claims team. We took a small, single specialty line that Chubb had written on the financial lines and turned that into a $6.5 million relationship by being able to write the comp, GL, auto and claims, all on a clash flow basis. Again, from an office we didn't have presence in and an agent we didn't have licensed, just terrific.","Paul J. Krump - Executive Vice President, Chubb Group & President, North America Commercial and Personal Insurance, Chubb Ltd.","I'll probably add just a little bit. As I watch that people travel together and understand each other's appetite, Evan calls it knitting the organization together, we're seeing every day in the middle market lots of opportunities. I heard about one this week out in Chicago where we were traveling to an agent that was appointed by legacy Chubb and just wanted to meet some of the legacy ACE underwriters, and they walked away with a $221,000 account just because they did not understand ACE's appetite obviously from the past. But we're very excited about the opportunity to learn more, and just in the course of the last two days resulted in a $221,000 account.","Juan C. Andrade - Executive Vice President, Chubb Group & President, Overseas General Insurance, Chubb Ltd.","Sarah, and this is Juan Andrade speaking for the international side. I think our theme is very much the same where particularly in places like Continental Europe, the U.K. and Asia Pacific, we've been very successful in cross-selling legacy ACE's property products into legacy Chubb's casualty portfolio. In addition to that, also bringing in legacy ACE's cyber products into the legacy Chubb financial lines portfolio. And probably the last example I would give has to do with our large account multinational business where now with the legacy Chubb workers compensation capability in the U.S., we're able to better round our multinational products for those companies.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You got a mouthful there, Sarah.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jay Gelb of Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. On page eight of the supplement, it shows total commercial P&C on a constant dollar basis being down just 0.5%. I was trying to get some perspective on how that result compares to your expectations at this point in the integration?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Pretty much in line with our expectation. I gave you the color that we were down around 1.5%, we had an impact of about 1.5% negative growth due to actions we took related to the combined portfolio as we did the merger. And that is around underwriting actions that we had contemplated, either non-renewal or purchasing reinsurance protections. And that is in line \u2013 additionally we did, because the market is soft, we did also take some underwriting actions a little bit above what we might have and related around reinsurance as well where we judge the risk\/reward. So, altogether, and that's what I said in the commentary, it makes good sense to me. Our renewal retention rates have remained very high, very good. And I've got to tell you, you look at the middle market business at 89.5%, that's high. That's a very good renewal retention rate which in the middle market commercial business in the United States today, the pattern is everyone who's responsible is trying to hold on to their renewals and there is less drive for new business.","Among those who really do have the data, have the presence, have good underwriting, there is a bunch of smaller wannabes who are doing some crazy things to, and I think fairly desperate things, to show growth and write new business. That's just normal stuff, nothing to do with the integration. And in our large account business, we ran over a 90% retention rate. Excellent. So what do you have? A high retention rate in the commercial businesses with good underwriting, underwriting action that we have taken to improve risk\/reward that we contemplated, and some actions that we took that impact net premium but improve our risk\/reward based on soft market conditions. Feeling pretty good to me.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's great. Thanks, Evan. And then I had a couple of quick ones for Phil. So, for the net investment income of $820 million to $830 million in the third quarter, would that have any impact on quarters beyond that as well?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In the last call we talked about a range of $820 million to $840 million, and we saw that as a view over the rest of the year and thinking that in the second quarter we'd be closer to the lower end of that range and in the fourth quarter we'd be closer to the higher end of that range. At this point we've said, look, we really can't foresee what interest rates are going to do much beyond the third quarter, so we've decided to limit our guidance to the $820 million to $830 million for the third quarter alone.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then finally on debt-to-capital, it's already down to 22% taking into account AOCI which had a gain in the second quarter. Can you remind us what your goals are relative to financial leverage?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Our leverage at this point is fine. From a rating agency standpoint, from any measure, our leverage is fine. I expect that as we continue to grow our capital base, just naturally that will decrease, but we're within our range.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the middle markets business. (42:28) and they were commenting that they thought that the new Chubb was expanding terms and conditions and the types of customers you take on in a fairly significant way. But I guess the question is, is that true? And if it is, if you could talk to the extent that that's happening in the market?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we'll talk a little bit about it but we're not going to give a roadmap to everybody out there. Paul, go ahead.","Paul J. Krump - Executive Vice President, Chubb Group & President, North America Commercial and Personal Insurance, Chubb Ltd.","Yes, Paul, I would unpack that a little bit. You really have two thoughts going there. One is appetite, and I would suggest to you that the two companies have come together and have very complementary appetites. Legacy ACE is bringing a lot of skill in areas that legacy Chubb didn't have. For example, cyber or environmental. And we are certainly cross-selling and taking advantage of those new skills.","So, yes, there's been an absolute increase in the Chubb appetite if you think about legacy Chubb in the middle market space. So accident and health would be another one where we are cross-selling. If you are talking about terms and conditions, I think Evan said it in his remarks, that we're seeing a slight erosion around the margin, in particular around cat. Flood, we're seeing people lower deductibles for the same premiums or increasing the sub-limits around quake. We are resisting that as best we possibly can. We are not in the business of under-pricing exposure, so we're trying to be as disciplined as we possibly can in this marketplace.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","And then I have sort of an unrelated question, but a broader one. Obviously, you put two big companies together and you have an executive leave because there's only one slot. Do you think we're pretty much through the period of time where we're going to see continuous headlines like we have in the past from people leaving and going else \u2013 is that process largely finished? More of a headline risk I guess that we sort of suffered through, wondering if you think we're done with that?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you know, frankly, the words you're choosing to use, I don't even relate to most of those. So it's too much time and gossip. We have lost, since the acquisition was announced on the legacy Chubb side, so in over a year, we lost at middle level ranks, 60 people. We lost about 30 to 35 people we didn't want to lose. Now, that grinds on me, however that is out of 31,000 people around the world, that is not a very big number, and word exodus of people, large numbers of this or that, I don't even relate to that. The stability is tremendous and the depth of talent here is great. And somebody steps out, now I'll tell you what, there is someone else eager to take that opportunity and move along.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","That's fair enough. Sorry for the poor choice of words, but thank you for the comments.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, what can I tell you, but I take it personally. This is personal.","Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thanks, again.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thank you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I have a follow-up on the cross-selling and the example that was given that was really helpful I think on the nursing home and the medical liability.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We'll be ready for you, Charles, when you get there.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Wanted to get a little deeper on how that works internally. So you have different underwriters that have different background and the products that are so large. So how does the Chubb D&O underwriter and the medical liability underwriter get together to understand \u2013 how does that work internally to put those pieces together to realize or recognize that opportunity is there? Or is that on the agent or broker to kind of piece that together?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know. It's both. First of all, that's the management job to begin with. A, it's organization structure and then it is management activity. So product lines that you take the medical liability area. The person in charge of medical liability is now in charge of our whole medical practice group, and we know that there has been legacy Chubb had a large appetite on the property side for that business, it had a great practice. And so those people become part of a common unit and they begin that unit at underwriting, at the underwriting side and they put together lists of common risks where everyone would play.","And then that moves down to our underwriters in the regions who understand that and they're caused to come together in that practice group, and then their movement into the branches where we have salespeople and agent relationship people who get educated. And the underwriters go out with them and they visit producers that have that business in those portfolios of it, and then management feedback because if you can't count it, it ain't worth doing, and so you've got targets and objectives, both financial and non-financial.","In the beginning, it's non-financial, because it's activity-related. It's related around internal activities of how people organize and how they're educating each other and how they're doing discovery. And then that turns into an offering and then you start moving that into submissions, and then those submissions move into quotes and then those quotes move into bound business and you are measuring that. Now you have entered our life.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. And I guess one other question, more industry-based. It seems like there's growing appetite in the marketplace of people looking to get into trade credit and political risk. Curious if that's your take on what's going on in the market and any commentary on what's going on in those product lines where that may be the case, knowing that that's something you guys have done for a long time.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","First of all, it's not new. There have been people entering this for the last five years, you've seen more entering the marketplace there; a lot of wannabes, small facilities, one underwriter and a little bit of capital, and not a real franchise. You see more people trying to enter now only because \u2013 listen, they're scratching for business. They don't want to shrink their \u2013 they think growth and just the top line equals strength.","They want to show more franchise capabilities, so they begin entering the market. Just look at the world today and imagine to yourself, which I think is the background of your question. Is this a brilliant time to enter the trade credit or political risk business? Interest rates at record lows, $11 trillion in negative rates, invested in negative spreads. You have real rates, you have a world awash in capital, tremendous amount of misallocation of capital. And with all that you have a world growing below trend economically and slowing down more, protectionism growing and geopolitical risk everywhere. Sounds like a brilliant time to get into that business, by the way, where rates are at a \u2013 not a record low, but are certainly at a low point. I wish them a lot of luck, because that's all they've got going for them.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much for the answers.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ian Gutterman of Balyasny.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Hi. Thanks. First, can I just get a clarification? Phil, when you talked about the $67 million of cost saves achieved, was that cumulative or was that just for the quarter?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's the amount realized from an accounting standpoint in the second quarter.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay, so the year-to-date then is closer to about $100 million?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, that's right. We had about $40 million in the first quarter.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it. Okay. And then just one quick clarification on the personal lines reinsurance, I assume that's a quota share for that size of premium?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's about as far as I'm going to go.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Okay. Fair enough. And then just a bigger picture question...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We don't talk about our reinsurance. Those are privately negotiated and I know people \u2013 there are others who will talk about their reinsurance placements as a matter of practice, Ian, so I'm not trying to be rude. As a matter of practice, we just don't talk about it.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","No, that's all right. That's okay. I was just trying to take a better guess on the modeling side, if I need to adjust cat loads or anything like that. And then just a bigger picture...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That was an intelligent thought right there, by the way; very intelligent thought.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","I tried. Then my bigger picture question, I thought I'd give you a platform if you want to use it. Following up on the Brexit question and what we're having here with the election, the world seems to be turning more anti-trade, anti-globalization. Chubb is obviously a big global insurance company. What ramifications are there if the world does go that way, and just what sort of things do you think about and worry about if we continue down this protectionist, populist path?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, Ian, that is the right question. The United States is a leader in the democratic, liberal-minded free world. We have a responsibility in that leadership. And we have been absent from the stage of late. We, as a country, recognize the price we seem to pay for that leadership. But we hardly recognize the benefits, that are enormous, that we gain as a country because the world is hardwired, since World War II, to advantage the United States. And the benefits to our economy and GDP and the benefits in terms of stability, where \u2013 economies don't flourish but with stability and predictability. And so it's worrisome. And the growing protectionism is worrisome. And the only way you move past that is with leadership, and it's political leadership. Central banks can't help you with this.","And protectionism, we all get what that does. At the end of the day, it's beggar-thy-neighbor and the pie grows smaller. The pie doesn't grow bigger. And if you want to feed those who are disadvantaged and you want to provide them opportunities and you want a more prosperous world, you need to be able to afford it. And the only way is through growth. And growth in trade and growth in global trade, where each can bring and use its comparative advantage, that has served the world well. And the way we're vilifying it and somehow re-trading on the past and characterizing it that trade has been evil and has damaged our country and has damaged the world is just so misguided. And then to add to that, that immigration is somehow our enemy is, again, misguided populism and feeding on the suffering of those who may vote. So you get where I stand clearly.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Well said. Well said. So just as a follow-up, does it change your appetite at all for \u2013 when you're looking at maybe possible acquisitions overseas or putting more capital to grow certain countries, do you hesitate in certain parts of the world now?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Ian, I hesitate wherever it's hostile.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Yes.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I give it thought. And obviously you go where you think the opportunity is. And if the opportunity looks more hostile, you're going to hesitate, you're going to wait, you're not going to rush. Even if you think longer-term, it's like, well, am I in a hurry right now, or do I have a year or two to wait? And you see lots of places around the world that way, as economic growth slows, insurance growth slows. That's the way it is, and so you adjust accordingly.","Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP","Got it. Appreciate the thoughts, thank you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And we go next to Larry Greenberg of Janney.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi. Good morning. I was going to try to push you a little bit further on the reinsurance, but I get the sense that's probably not a good idea.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, you got it. I mean, you can push, but you're not going to get anywhere.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Let me just \u2013 so just from a modeling standpoint, since you gave me the opening. So we've got premiums going down and we've got the expense ratio going down. It seems under normal conditions the premium decline would more than offset the expense ratio decline. And I know we get into questions of is this tail coverage, is this more attritional loss coverage, but is there anything you could help us with in that equation?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we each have our own hell to live in, and the only thing I could tell you is, is that we think we're pretty good analysts. We think we understand our business pretty well, and we are thoughtful when we make trades and transactions, and we plan for the long-term, not just short-term opportunistic. And we understand how to measure risk\/reward. We're fiduciaries of shareholder money, and we're going to exercise that fiduciary responsibility carefully. And so when we make any trades or any transactions like that we do all the analysis. And as I said earlier, the risk\/reward is in our benefit.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great. That's helpful. And then, just reconciling...","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Didn't help your model, I know that.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","No, no. Not at all, but that's okay. So you said that cats in the quarter were $100 million or so higher than you would have contemplated before. And you also said that industry-wide, cats were kind of in line with history but above near-term recent performance. So I'm just trying to reconcile, you know, that $100 million and looking forward and I know that personal lines reinsurance thing is going to change this a little bit. But was your cat assumption too low relative to history and would you adjust that at all at this point?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't think so. And (60:29) what the companies and the two companies' historic averages are so they each have a different basis and remember I was looking at \u2013 I gave a worldwide average of industry that way. So you know you've got a little bit of chalk and cheese there when you're thinking about that, but where I link them is directionally when I look at the industry losses, even though they were more elevated, but historic \u2013 and I look at our share of them and relative to our share of business, et cetera, they didn't throw me at all. It made good sense to me, number one.","Number two, you saw the Global Re , actually had a part of cat losses in the quarter. And you know, they've been relatively quiet. They sell cat excess, we have for many, many years. And so, you know, you get the natural volatility of reinsurance that way, your reinsurance portfolio and they've done very well, by the way, and that business of ours. And so they contributed $50 million or $60 million to that increase. And it was above what they would have expected, but it's cat excess, so, what do you know. If I look at what we would have anticipated in the quarter, legacy ACE by itself would have been about five points of earned premium in the quarter would have been an expected \u2013 the two companies together now, about 5.75 points of earned premium. So the volatility signature hasn't really changed. So anyway, maybe that gives you a little color around it.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. As we get to the back half of the year, both companies do their asbestos analyses. I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on different procedures or a different approach or a concept of merging those two, sort of, processes together as we go through that.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, one company is under a statutory order and that is the Brandywine which is runoff. And so the State of Pennsylvania has an external review while we do our own internal and we do our own internal annually anyway. And legacy Chubb has done an annual review and we're bringing those two together. And by the way, it's on the margin what the differences are between the two in approach. Very, very similar, but it's a unified team that will \u2013 management team that will oversight the two together. That's it.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And the seasonality, that's a 3Q situation for everyone?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, it's a fourth quarter.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Fourth quarter. Okay.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We do environmental in the third quarter, asbestos in the fourth quarter.","Unknown Speaker","That's right.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. All my other questions are answered.","Operator","And we turn next to Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks, Evan. A couple of questions here. First one, last quarter you talked a little bit about small commercial opportunity in the U.S. I noticed this quarter U.K., Ireland, a new product, some other stuff in Europe. Can you talk about what the SME opportunity is for you guys now that the combined Chubb here in Europe?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Juan, you want to just touch on it?","Juan C. Andrade - Executive Vice President, Chubb Group & President, Overseas General Insurance, Chubb Ltd.","Sure. So, Brian, I think for us, the SME opportunity outside of the United States is also pretty significant. If you look at just the number of enterprises that are out there that really would fall into that category, there's a significant amount of premium. We've had an ongoing strategy in legacy ACE, I would say over the last six years, to really target that space. And initially we started in developing markets, particularly in Asia and Latin America, and frankly we've been pretty successful in growing that business profitably.","The emerging markets business is simpler. Basically small property-type packages, some liability, et cetera. In the U.K. and in Continental Europe with the distribution that legacy Chubb is bringing, we're now expanding some of those capabilities as well. And that's probably what you have seen in maybe some of the press releases that you may have been referring to is the fact that we're rolling out new product and new capability especially around specialty products. Small D&O, small environmental, that sort of thing, really to target the smaller enterprises in the U.K. and the continent.","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And that gets around packages, traditional packages, we're adding specialty coverages to them. We're after industry verticals the same way we do in the U.S. But understand that these are small premiums per policy.","And so to move the stick and really grow a volume takes years of patience. So, it's not something we're going to discuss every quarter. And it's one of those things that we'll polish it in the basement and we'll march out with it. It's looking pretty good there.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And then one other quick question here for you, Evan, another topic with the elections here coming up. Tort environment, what are your kind of thoughts on the tort environment? We've got a new Supreme Court Justice that's going to have to be put in place here. Are you seeing anything that anywhere is alarmist right now with respect to trend in the tort environment in the U.S.? What are your thoughts going forward?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The tort environment is reasonably stable. There are hostile trends. There are rulings that we have noticed over the last year or two years, particularly in labor and labor-related liability, depending on the state because it's state-based, not Federal, workers comp, and which is again labor-related and that more in the main. On the other side of the coin, the Federal Courts and particularly the Supreme Court has been pretty friendly in its rulings more favorable for corporate. And when you look at class actions and security class actions-related rulings, those have been favorable. Look, you look forward, depending on who's elected, we could see a more liberal turn to the courts. And think that would ultimately be hostile to tort and for insurance.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.","And we have time for just one more person to ask question, please.","Operator","And we'll take that final question from Meyer Shields of KBW.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Evan, can you explain why the actions you're taking on legacy Fireman's Fund wouldn't necessarily work in Brazil, leading to the decision to sort of exit that high net worth market?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Say that again, excuse me.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. You talked about how you're exiting the high net worth personal lines market in Brazil. And I'm wondering why the same sort of actions that you're taking on Fireman's Fund \u2013 on legacy Fireman's Fund business aren't applicable there?","Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Sure. It's the automobile business. If you look at structurally how Brazil works, there's two or three very large players who dominate the marketplace. And number one \u2013 and they have such an advantage in terms of distribution, claims management, data, et cetera. And high net worth auto in Brazil is code word for simply very high valued automobiles, and by the way, a lot of sports cars. You may not know this, but I think the second city in the world with the greatest number of Ferraris is S\u00e3o Paulo, and that's just a parlor statistic for you.","And the ability to be able to price that business, manage it well and have a business that is of a large enough size because the definition of high net worth in Brazil relative to high net worth, say in the United States, is so different. In the U.S., a fraction of our portfolio is automobile. Most of it is homeowners, jewelry, art, furnishings, it's a much broader portfolio. Auto is a minority portion of it. You get to Brazil, there is no high valued homeowners per se, and insuring all the rest, very tiny market. So it's the reverse. You end up with an automobile portfolio that is very, in a sense, anti-selected and hard to manage and that you don't get paid for and you don't have the benefits of all the rest. So there is an underwriting tutorial, Meyer, 101.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Yes. That's helpful and I did not know that about the Ferraris. In the aggregate, I guess this is a question for Phil, was there an FX impact to EPS in the quarter?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. It was about $6 million to underwriting and $10 million to bottom line.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then is there a run rate for the other income that we can anticipate?","Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. I think what I'll do, if you don't mind, we take that offline and I'll take you through the documents that we've put out that show the amortization of the intangibles and all of that, right? So we can help you with that.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Helen Wilson for any additional or closing remarks.","Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.","Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention this morning.

Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Karen Beyer","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Chubb's June 30, 2019 second quarter earnings conference call.","Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance and growth opportunities, pricing and business mix, and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.","See our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce our speakers this morning. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll then take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Evan.","Evan Greenberg","Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a very good second quarter highlighted by excellent underwriting and strong premium revenue growth globally in constant dollars that is benefitting from favorable underwriting conditions and our various growth initiatives. In fact, the positive pricing in underwriting environment continued to improve through the quarter and spread to more classes and segments of business.","Core operating income was $1.2 billion with $2.60 per share down 3% due to modestly higher year-on-year CAT losses. Book and tangible book value per share were up 3.2% and 4.7% respectively in the quarter, they\u2019re now up 7.7% and nearly 12% for the year. Combination of income and the mark derived from falling interest rates.","Our combined ratio of 90.1%, included 3.8 points of CAT losses, and 2.6 points of favorable prior period reserve development. So, on a current accident year basis, excluding CAT, the combined ratio was 88.9%. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, CAT and prior period development.","Turning to growth, P&C premium revenue in the quarter, in constant dollars was quite strong. Net premiums return grew 6% with foreign exchange having a negative impact of 1.8 percentage points.","The pricing environment continued to firm through the quarter and we took advantage of some of the best pricing we\u2019ve seen in years. The rate of increase of prices accelerated while at the same time it spread to more classes of business and more classes of risk. Rates continue to firm in the U.S. for major accounts in E&S specialty to the middle market. We continued to observe favorable conditions in the London wholesale market and in Australia with their early signs, firming conditions are spreading to the U.K. company market and to certain classes of risk on the continent and Europe and Southeast Asia.","Overall, where rates are moving, they\u2019re firming broadly to varying degrees in most all short and long-tail classes. Accompanying price increases, terms and conditions are tightening in certain classes. In my judgment given some of the market dislocation we\u2019ve observed including a reset of risk appetite on the part of some, this firming trend is sustainable and will likely continue to accelerate and spread. It is income and loss reserve driven, not capital driven.","Overall prices increased in North America commercial on a written basis by about 7% in the quarter versus a loss cost trend in aggregate of just 4.5%. Renewal price change includes both rate and exposure; the rate was up 6.3 and exposure a half a point. Pricing improved throughout the quarter in many property and casualty related areas including general casualty, both primary and excess, D&O and professional lines. As more business comes into our underwriting appetite and price range and other carriers take corrective actions, we are benefiting from a flight to quality. All things being equal many buyers prefer Chubb.","New business in our North America commercial lines was up over a 11% in the quarter with major accounts and specialty up nearly 15%. Retention of our customers remained strong across all of our North America Commercial and Personal P&C businesses with renewal retention as measured by premium of 93.5%. In major accounts and specialty commercial, excluding agriculture, premiums were up 7% with major up 5.5 and Westchester E&S up over 9%.","Renewal price change for major accounts was 8.5% with risk management pricing up 6.3%, excess casualty up almost 10%, and property up nearly 18.5%. Public D&O rates increased to 11%. In our Westchester business renewal pricing was up over 9.5%.","Turning to our middle market and small commercial business, premiums overall were up over 4.5%. Renewal retention in our middle market business was 92%. Middle market pricing was up over 4.5% and if you exclude workers' comp, it was up nearly 5%. Again, this is the best we've seen in a number of years. The middle market pricing for primary casualty was up 4.5%, property 6.5%, excess umbrella up over 6% and public D&O rates were up 18%.","In our North America personal lines business, net premiums in the quarter were down 2%, but adjusting for the expanded reinsurance that we have discussed in the past and an accounting change that impacted growth prior year, net premiums written were up about 2.5. Retention remained strong at 96% and for homeowners pricing was up nearly 10% in the quarter.","Turning to our international business, growth accelerated in our Overseas General Insurance operation. With net written premiums and constant dollar up [Technical Difficulty] had a negative impact of almost 6 points. Net premiums for our London market wholesale business were up over 24% while our retail division was up 7.5% with growth led by Latin America up almost to 11% and Asia up about 9%.","In our London wholesale business, we continued to see a reduction in capacity and rates firming across multiple lines of business. We are also seeing a significant increase in submissions to Chubb, as brokers worry about the continuity of markets as they look to us as a preferred carrier of choice. Overall rates in our London open market business were up over 9%, property was up 23.5%, marine cargo almost 7.5%, aviation was up 12 and onshore energy was up 15%. D&O rates in the London wholesale market were up 20%.","Our life insurance business had a strong quarter and half year with a contribution to earnings of 76 million year-to-date. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter including current market conditions and pricing trends.","In closing this was a good quarter for Chubb. We have momentum from affirming market, flight to quality and our various global growth initiatives. We're achieving rate which is supporting margins and helping ameliorate exposures we observe on the loss side. In some we have some wind in our sails and we're taking advantage of it. Our organization is focused, energized and hungry.","With that I'll turn the call over to Phil.","Philip Bancroft","Thank you, Evan. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remain quite strong. We have a $107 billion portfolio, cash and high quality investments that is well rated and liquid and we are generating substantial capital, a significant positive cash flow. Cash flow in the quarter was $1.4 billion.","Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $720 million to shareholders including $344 million in dividends and $376 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date through yesterday, we have repurchased over 800 million in shares at an average price of $140 per share.","In June, we paid off $500 million of debt that matured and issued $1.3 billion of 8 and 12 year debt in the European market. The net proceeds will be used to repay our $1.3 billion senior debt at maturity in November 2020. The debt was issued at an average rate of 1.14%.","We grew tangible book value per share by 4.7% in the quarter and 11.9% year-to-date. Since the close of the Chubb acquisition in 2016, tangible book value per share has fully recovered from the initial 29% dilution even excluding the favorable impact of unrealized gains.","Our annualized core operating ROE in the quarter was 9.3% and our annualized core operating return on tangible equity was 15.2%. As a reminder, Chubb records a change in the fair value mark on its private equity funds as realized gain. So therefore, it is not included in core operating income. Other companies record the impact of the mark as part of their investment income. This quarter we had after-tax realized gains of $237 million which would increase our core operating EPS by $0.51 and our annualized core operating ROE to 11.1%.","Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $902 million pre-tax which was higher than our estimated range and benefited from a one-off accrual adjustment of $9 million and increased corporate bond fall activity.","During the quarter, interest rates continued to decline as financial markets anticipated a shift in Fed policy towards monetary easing. This favorably impacted our portfolio mark-to-market resulting in an after-tax unrealized gain of $1 billion. Although market yields have declined significantly in recent months, we will remain conservative in our investment strategy and do not contemplate any significant shift in asset allocation. Our investment income going forward will continue to benefit from growth in our invested assets and will be impacted by the level of market interest rates. Despite the negative impact of lower rates, we expect net investment income to grow moderately due to our growth in invested assets and strong cash flow.","We now expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income run rate to be in the range of $890 million to $900 million going forward. Adjusted interest expense was $145 million pre-tax in the quarter. Factoring in the debt to mature and the new Euro debt issue in June, we expect our quarterly adjusted interest expense to remain the same for the balance of the year. Pre-tax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $275 million principally from U.S. weather-related events.","We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of a $188 million pre-tax or $152 million after tax. This included $48 million of pre-tax adverse development on prior year catastrophe losses principally for hurricane Irma and typhoon JV primarily in our assumed reinsurance operation and $25 million pre-tax adverse development related to our runoff non-A&E casualty exposures.","The remaining favorable development of $261 million is split approximately 90% from long-tail lines principally from accident years 2015 and prior and 10% from short-tail lines.","Foreign currency movement adversely impacted core operating income by $23 million in the quarter. On a constant dollar basis, net loss reserves increased $831 million reflecting catastrophe losses in the quarter and the seasonal increase in our crop reserve offset by favorable prior period development.","A paid-to-incurred ratio was 87%. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.3% which is in line with our annual expected range of 14% to 16%. Through six months, our core operating effective tax rate was 15%.","I'll turn the call back to Karen.","Karen Beyer","Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Mike Phillips","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. First question on Evan on your comments of what's driving the rate activity. I believe you said something like its income and reserve driven not capital driven. So, I guess want to know if you can expand upon that kind of implies there's going to be some timing of reserve issues and maybe what you've seen and why you mentioned are reserve driven?","Evan Greenberg","Well, just simply the rate has not kept pace with loss cost trend and that puts pressure on income and it puts pressure ultimately on reserves. You're either I think that it just imply, it shows what it implies the balance sheets over time, and have less redundancy in them.","And for some are adequate, for others and become negative for others. And you have a loss cost environment that in many ways in the headlines is stable. But you have areas of casualty and catastrophe's and other areas within the business where there is volatility. And there is trend pressure.","And so, my comments meant to imply all of that. What I was saying to you is income and balance sheet not capital driven that there was a dearth of capital. There is plenty of capital around and but it is more disciplined at this moment and it comes to its deployed with the rate and terms are more adequate.","Mike Phillips","Okay. Well, thank you, that's helpful. I guess if I could turn specifically to North America commercial lines, where I guess dependent on what you use for 2Q '18 with your comments from last year, the structure settlement term had some impact there.","So, the core loss ratio deteriorated about a 70 bips or a 170 bips dependent on how you adjust for that. Our set looks like kind one of the highest core loss ratios that's seen in a while. We heard Trevor just now talk about non- CAT weather, I'm not sure if any of that came into play here for that segment for you or what else truly uptick and maybe has your view of loss trends and that segment -- since last quarter?","Evan Greenberg","Let look at North America commercial P&C that's looking on a current accident year ex-CAT. Last year ran an 80 74 combined ratio. This year ran an 80 79 combined ratio. I mean, simply outstanding world class and in the 80s. So, let's have that perspective.","We wrote the same volume of LPTs this year that we did last year and so no impact from that. It was simply rate and trend naturally, not a non-CAT weather or any of that, just simply rate and trend something I've been saying for many quarters. Thanks for the question.","Mike Phillips","Alright, thank you.","Evan Greenberg","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning.","Evan Greenberg","Good morning.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question, Evan, is also just going back I guess to some of your comments to the previous question on just what you're seeing with loss trend. You guys seeing any trend changes and that TOD environment. And I know there is a lot of different classes that went together but that 4.5% of trend that you said in the book for North America commercial.","Can you give us some perspective on how that would compare and maybe it's not number, it's just for qualitatively to what you're seeing in some recent quarters?","Evan Greenberg","Sure, Elyse. In the aggregate in the round, it's a loss cost trend is stable; we haven\u2019t seen a change in it. As you rightfully note though within that, it varies by class of business and area of business, we've talked for a number of quarters for quite some time now about professional lines D&A in particular and I won't repeat or go into what we've talked about.","But simply about the increase of frequency and in some areas severity in that. In the TOD environment, generally there has been less of an increase of frequency but and in there had been headlines of increase in severity during of what's paces in here, see it from commercial lot owed to products liability that is chemical related.","And then, the trend from of TOD from #MeToo and molestation and the specter in the future of the reviver statutes which is unknowable at the time. There is and then the Australian market behaves a certain and TOD and the London market U.K. where D&O had deteriorated.","So, you have it varies by area and by class of business, comp on the other hand behaved very well. General liability behaves in a steady way, reasonably steady. So, I hope that helps you.","Elyse Greenspan","Yes, that's helpful. And then, on you said kind of and talking to the core margin within North America commercial that the delta between this Q2 and last Q2 is really just to rate versus trend. You see, in on your comments this quarter and also last quarter pretty bullish on pricing and the fact that you would think it would continue.","So, do you think where reaching the point where obviously it takes a while to earn in the rate but if you keep getting this rate and accelerates, do you think as we get into 2020 you can think about that being an environment where there will be come core margin improvement?","Evan Greenberg","We're in the risk business, so I can project the numerator reasonably well to you. I can't reject and prognosticate the denominator. The denominator I can project, I can't quite project the numerator the same way to you because we are in a risk business.","And so, look rate exceeding trend is a simple statement, it's an ameliorating factor and that's a good thing. We'll see what its impact is on margin in the future.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you. And the, one last quick numbers question. You guys mentioned you've added a little bit to your Debby last in the quarter. What are you guys taking that as for ensure loss for the overall industry right now?","Evan Greenberg","I don\u2019t have a number in my head, my colleagues around the table don\u2019t but will we'll take it offline with you, we'll give you a number.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much.","Evan Greenberg","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you. Good morning. Going with the North America commercial, so Evan, you're talking about world class margins there and loss trends that are stable. I guess, do you need more rate in that segment today or is this maybe an opportunity to try and take market share or others are still pushing free?","Evan Greenberg","It varies by class of business and there is no general statement. Some classes are adequately priced, some classes need rate and terms and conditions changes and some classes need substantial rate. And so, it varies, it's there is no other simple box for that.","But as I think you can see our new business is up, our renewal retention is high or in a more favorable underwriting environment and where it make sense to us and we've got a lot of data and a lot of experience, we're leaning right into it.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, thank you. And then, I guess if I shift to the investment portfolio. So, it sounds like apart from comments that you're not really looking for any change in direction here even with the change in monitory policy. One thing I did notice was an increase in duration sequentially. Is there a strategic move or was that just of normal quarterly noise or movement?","Philip Bancroft","It was simply tactical, at the end of last year we had a decrease to duration because we were getting paid to take duration risk. And with the course of this year it's drifted up slightly but to the extent it's within half a point or half a year or four years, we don\u2019t think there's any material impact on our investment income.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. So, you're not necessarily looking to extend duration here?","Philip Bancroft","We're not.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, thank you.","Philip Bancroft","Welcome.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Hi thanks, good morning. So, clearly in terms and conditions, rate have accelerated improved throughout the year. Evan, would you say on the other side that loss trend today is it' some more challenging environment in over six months ago?","Evan Greenberg","No. Let's say its if I compare six months ago to today, it's stable.","Ryan Tunis","Fair enough. And then, I guess I'll be the annoying one to ask about the crop but just curious what the thought process was in and how you're thinking about the planting, so it didn\u2019t look like you put up a loss taking agriculture, I'm not sure if you did but just in your thoughts there.","Evan Greenberg","Sure. Let me make just a couple of comments about that. And it's not an annoying, I would be surprised if when you didn\u2019t ask about it. First of all, we did put up the loss ratio about 2.5 points this quarter. So, but what you have to recognize it's on a low earned premium base at this time of year.","And it is not signaling at this point what you should imagine for third quarter or for fourth quarter at all. Given the weather conditions this spring and potential impact on prevented planting or delayed planting along with the volatility that in commodity prices, impact by trade and other factors, its natural the questions raised about what kind of year we're anticipating for crop.","So, in a word it's \"unknowable.\" Our modals under various scenarios moving toward roughly average year. However, the actually tally or prevented planting claims, the summer growing season conditions and therefore the result in quality of the crop commodity prices and then the full harvest weather conditions are rolled to play out all of that's in front of us.","So, we simply raised our loss ratio modestly in the second quarter as a naturally conservative action very little bit that we can say.","Ryan Tunis","Thank you.","Evan Greenberg","But it's unknowable when if you know, then I'll tell you what but and we're going to make a lot of money in hedging in commodities. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. Congrats in the quarter. I want to ask, if I make my own assumption about where we are from pricing versus loss cost spread. Is there anything in either the North America commercial or the overseas more business mix and that this is exchange, they would affect though that sort of simple calculation for me?","Evan Greenberg","You have to explain. I'm not really sure what you're asking me Paul.","Paul Newsome","So what I'm asking is, is the natural business mix all things being equal going to be for a business that has lower or higher combined ratios because I think we're all making an assumption of whether or not Chubb hit a point where the earnings or the price increases are above claim costs inflation that gives us an estimate of where we think we're going to see the inflexion margins. But that calculation assumes basically that the business mix is the same in the various segments?","Evan Greenberg","The business mix within the segments is reasonably steady. There's a big book of business. So there is not big shift taking place. There's always, every quarter it changes is jittery, but in the round at some, the mix is quite steady.","Paul Newsome","And then, I'm sorry I'm going to beat on crop a little bit, but is there a chance that given the delay in the harvest, we could see a change in the premium recognition from mainly in third to more in the fourth?","Evan Greenberg","No. ","Paul Newsome","Okay, thank you.","Evan Greenberg","It's formulaic. So, no.","Operator","We will take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. A couple here for you. First, I'm just curious in the overseas area Evan, reserve releases kind of really slowed down on year-over-year basis, were there any kind of one-timers there that was going on?","Evan Greenberg","No, there was not.","Brian Meredith","And then, the growth you're seeing. No, one timers, got you. And the growth you're seeing in that overseas where's it coming from? Is that some of these new distribution relationships you have, other things going on?","Philip Bancroft ","Brian this is one on dry day. The growth is actually pretty broad based as Evan said in his opening remarks, we certainly are seeing a pretty good growth coming out of our London wholesale market operation as we see the market continuing to firm and we see contraction and capacity there. But underlying all of that and particularly for our retail businesses, it's really our strategies continuing to gain traction and I'm talking about our strategies in the small commercial, the middle market, accident and health personal lines on a global basis.","The distribution agreements are certainly doing well. We are getting good traction on all of that so I would say it's really a combination of our organic strategies in addition to the right that we're continuing to see now.","Brian Meredith","Great, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb","Thank you and good morning. Given the ongoing shifts we're seeing and tightening in the commercial property casualty insurance market, Evan I'm wondering if in this environment it might shift your thinking on mergers and acquisitions at all?","Evan Greenberg","No. Steady and it doesn't shift with the times that way. So we know, I've been very consistent in when I ask this for many years now. We are builders and we're a company of builders and we have a strategy to grow our company organically. And acquisitions complement that strategy. They help to advance it or improve upon it in any and the strategy is product segment of customer distribution and territory oriented.","And when we identify the right target or partner and financials and we judge it to advance our strategy and in a positive way and will be accretive to our shareholders, their capital then we know our minds and we will pull that trigger.","Jay Gelb","That's helpful, thank you. Just a follow-up on that with the potential for acquisitions to complement organic growth, is that imply you're more focused on bolt-on acquisitions as opposed to something larger or transformational?","Evan Greenberg","We're agnostic.","Jay Gelb","Understood, thank you.","Evan Greenberg","I am sorry, there's not really more to say there.","Operator","We will take our final question from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields","Thanks, good morning. And I was hoping you could talk about what you're seeing in reinsurance. We're getting a lot of commentary that's very positive especially on the CAT fee side, didn't see tremendous amount of growth in global reinsurance this quarter?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. The reinsurance market is, I think modestly tightening. I think for the most part reinsures are riding on the backs of primary riders and if they feel pressure in their own income or balance sheet statements then they're more taking action by seasons they select and they're banking on seasons to get better rates and terms that ultimately feed into their results.","It's more unusual than we've seen in the past typically we would have seen a change in market pricing cycles more reinsurance led that doesn't happen. And I think in many cases reinsures their results are inferior due that of insurers\u2019 results and other than Chubb, I'm surprised they don't take more action in their underwriting positions on reinsurance. And that they don't drive higher pricing, better terms themselves. I can't prognosticate the future, but so far I see it's relatively modest, the changes, the terms and conditions and pricing in the reinsurance market.","Meyer Shields","That's very helpful, thanks. And second, Chubb came out with a fairly strong statement on climate change in the context of which entity you're willing to underwrite. Has that changed, I guess loss trend assumptions for property risk?","Evan Greenberg","No. You're referring to the decision we took on coal.","Meyer Shields","Yes.","Evan Greenberg","And it's a de-minimis portion of our writings.","Meyer Shields","Okay, perfect, thanks so much.","Evan Greenberg","You're welcome.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we will take our next question from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Greg Peters","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing my question. Evan in the past you've commented on the impact of the tariffs and trade wars that seemed to be evolving from quarter-to-quarter and I wanted to give you an opportunity to give us an update on how you think the current environment has affected your business and what we should be thinking about in our calculus about the results going forward?","Evan Greenberg","Yes. We grew our overseas business by 9% in the quarter and you see it broad based. So I don't see a linkage between tariffs and the health of Chubb's business and our business is more idiosyncratic. They are active in local markets around the world where you're impacted by their local economic plus their trade and their trade related economic invention. So, yes both.","Look when it comes to, I'm not in favor of tariffs as a strategy and I'm not in favor of putting the walls up and bring in your supply chains home. This is a globalized world in terms of trade and world led by a vision, America's vision of global trade. I continue to stand behind that and think that's the best path to peace and prosperity for the citizens of our nation. And so, I hope that we will engage more in reaching conclusions to trade agreements than imposing further tariffs.","Obviously, the degree that the tariffs and other actions, other protectionist actions taken slow down economic growth around the world, this country is not immune and the insurance industry is then not immune because we grow, we're exposure driven, not about premium, premium is a proxy for exposure, we grow based on growth of exposure globally. An economic activity grows or contracts exposure.","Greg Peters","Speaking about industries, one of the themes that has emerged for I guess, a couple of years now is pricing, price increases in commercial auto and I'm trying to reconcile the desire by the insurance market to raise prices on the trucking industry with the news it seems like every other week we're hearing about troubles in the trucking industry whether it's LME or Timmerman Starlite. And so, I'm curious what your perspective is on the balance between rate and fiscal survival of an industry?","Evan Greenberg","We are not responsible for the fiscal survival of any industry except our own and I know from my perspective, I'm a fiduciary of shareholder capital that expects a reasonable return if we deploy that capital towards the trucking industry to take insurance risk. I can tell you that Chubb writes a fair amount of trucking related long, medium and short haul exposure.","We work with clients who are embracing modern technology and that exists today and they've got strong balance sheets to lower their loss costs, to reduce their exposures, to police driver behavior and that results in amelioration of lost costs rises and therefore the premiums we charge, it's a pretty rational circle of life there. And for those who simply operate in a less professional manner and can't police their loss cost will be to buy insurance the price is going to be reflected, that's it.","Greg Peters","I'm not trying to suggest that you have financial responsibility for the trucking industry. I just realized that everyone wants to raise prices on long-haul trucking, etcetera and yet it seems like a lot of the long-haul truckers are having a lot of headwinds and their survival is in question. So there's a balance to be had exposed between charging higher prices and actually not being able to have a customer insure at all?","Evan Greenberg","Yes, but if it was and I understand what you're saying. If it was to raise prices to earn unreasonable margins were to earn any margin. I mean, right now the trucking business is not, that's never been an easy business and to make any money in trucking. So is it better if you can't make any money to just say then I won't insure it at all. They are uninsurable. They can't buy insurance.","Now you go out of business instantly versus you're going to work with those who can work with themselves and help to reduce loss costs and ameliorate price and so I tell you there's not a one-size-fits-all in trucking. There are those who are quite professional and we work with them and they have far more modest price increases than say those who don't have the wherewithal or capability or desire to embrace technologies that will help to ameliorate that rise in their loss cost. The best they can do for you.","Greg Peters","Okay, great, thanks for your answers.","Evan Greenberg","You're welcome.","Operator","And this does conclude today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Karen Beyer for additional or closing remarks.","Karen Beyer","Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to seeing you again next quarter. Thanks and have a great day.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"4886":["The Chubb (NYSE:CB) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 19, 2012  5:00 PM ET","Executives","John D.

Today's call is being recorded.","Before we begin, Chubb has asked me to make the following statements.

","Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Finnegan.","John D. Finnegan","Thank you, for joining us. We had a very good first quarter, highlighted by a strong underlying performance and relatively benign catastrophe losses. We're also very pleased that the positive rate momentum we have seen in recent quarters has continued. ","Operating income per share was $1.70 compared to $1.35 in last year's first quarter. This resulted in an annualized operating ROE of 13.8% for the first quarter this year. The combined ratio for the quarter was 90.2 compared to 93.7 last year. Excluding cash, the combined ratio for the first quarter was 89.4 in 2012 and 84.2 last year, with the difference almost entirely attributable to lower favorable development this quarter. ","During the first quarter, we had net realized investment gains of $56 million before tax or $0.13 per share after tax. This brought our first quarter net income per share to $1.83, resulting in an annualized ROE of 13.1%. Chubb's book value per share at March 31, 2012 was $57.37. As the 2% increase share in 2011 and a 10% increase this March 31, a year ago. Our capital position is excellent. ","During the first quarter, we increased our common stock dividend for the 30th consecutive year, and we also continued our share repurchase program as Ricky will discuss later. Net written premiums were up 3% driven by Chubb Commercial and Chubb Personal Insurance. Excluding the impact of currency translation, net written premiums were up 4%. ","In terms of the market environment, average renewal rates increased in our U.S. standard commercial lines by high single digits, and our specialty book by mid-single digits. A continuation of this rate environment should bode well for our future profitability. Paul and Dino will talk more about rates and reviews of their segments. ","And now we'll start with Paul, who will discuss the performance of Chubb's Commercial and Specialty Insurance operations.","Paul J. Krump","Thanks, John. The Chubb Commercial Insurance, net written premiums for the first quarter were up 6% to $1.4 billion. The combined ratio was 93.3 versus 100.7 in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's first quarter combined ratio was 92.4% compared to 84.5% in the first quarter of 2011. This increase is favorable reserve development in the first quarter of this year. We are pleased with CCI's average U.S. renewal rate increase in the first quarter of 8%, continuing the rate momentum that we have been discussing on our recent earnings calls. This 8% compares with the 6% we obtained in the fourth quarter last year and 0 in the first quarter of 2011. ","As with the case in the fourth quarter of last year, CCI secured U.S. renewal rate increases in each line of business in the first quarter of 2012. Monoline property rates increased the most, climbing by double digits, followed by workers' compensation, general liability, package, excess umbrella, automobile, boiler and Marine. Further evidence of continued positive rate momentum can be found in the growing proportion of our accounts that are renewing with rate increases. In the first quarter, about 80% of our U.S. accounts that renewed received a rate increase, compared to 70% in the fourth quarter of last year. ","Turning now to markets outside of the United States, we are especially encouraged that CCI's renewal rates were up in the low single digits in Europe. Although modest, these were the best rate increases we've had in Europe since 2004. In addition, CCI continued to obtain rate increases in Canada and Australia, along with some of our smaller markets in Asia. With respect to CCI's exposure change metrics during the first quarter, we experienced healthy midterm endorsement activity, as well as strong workers' compensation premium audits. In fact, audit and endorsement premium accounted for more than 1\/4 of our workers' compensation lines, robust growth in the quarter. The remainder was attributable to strong renewal rate and exposure increases, with only a minor decline in retention. New business volume for workers' comp also exceeded lost business but was slightly lower compared to new business in the year-ago first quarter. ","Renewal premium retention in the first quarter was 83% in the U.S., down 2 points from the fourth quarter. We attribute the decline in retention to 2 factors: Our push for rate increases and our having to win some package and Monoline property business in cat-prone areas. These tradeoffs make a good business sense and are consistent with Chubb's historical preference for bottom-line underwriting profit over topline premium growth. ","With respect to new business, we continue to be vigilant in our assessment, which resulted in our writing less new business. CCI's new to lost business ratio in the U.S. was 0.9:1 in the first quarter, down from 1.1:1 in the fourth quarter of last year. ","Turning now to Chubb Specialty Insurance. Premiums declined 6% in the first quarter to $602 million and the combined ratio was 93.6. From the professional liability portion of CSI, net written premiums were down 2% to $538 million and the combined ratio was 98.5 compared to 86.8 in the first quarter of 2011. The increase in the combined ratio was attributable to less favorable prior-year development, along with the current accident year being booked at a higher combined ratio, given the prolonged soft market environment and continued weak macroeconomic conditions. These factors are the reason for our aggressive drive for rate increases and other underwriting actions. ","We are very pleased that average renewal rates for professional liability in the U.S. increased 4% in the first quarter. That compares to 1% in the fourth quarter of last year and negative 3% in the first quarter of 2011. The 7-point swing from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of this year reflects our push for rate in the professional liability marketplace. The renewal rate increases were led by private company D&O, followed by not for profit D&O, EPL, prime, D&O, fiduciary and public company D&O. In markets outside the U.S., the renewal rate environment for professional liability improved slightly but lagged the improvement in the U.S. ","In the first quarter of this year, rates in our major markets outside of the U.S. were approximately flat compared to down a few points in fourth quarter of 2011. Renewal premium retention for professional liability in the first quarter was 85% in the U.S., identical to the fourth quarter. Professional liabilities new to lost business ratio in the U.S. was 0.8:1 compared to 0.7:1 in the fourth quarter of last year. ","Regarding the surety portion of our CSI book, net written premiums in the first quarter were down 27% to $64 million and the combined ratio was 56.3. While our surety operation was off to a slow start due to our existing clients winning fewer large bondable projects, we did not lose any major clients in the quarter and our overall customer count grew. Likewise, our average bond rates on new projects were up modestly in the first quarter versus a year ago. As always, our focus in this lumpy business is bottom-line profitability. ","And with that, I will turn it over to Dino, who will review Personal Lines and Corporate Claims.","Dino E. Robusto","Thanks, Paul. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 5% in the first quarter to $940 million. CPI produced a combined ratio of 85.5 compared to 93.8 in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes on CPI's first quarter was only 1.2 points in 2012 where as last year, severe winter weather in the U.S., combined with flooding in Australia produced the first quarter catastrophe total of 7.8 points. ","On an x cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 84.3 in the first quarter, compared to 86 in the first quarter of 2011. A relatively benign winter in the U.S. resulted in fewer non-cat weather-related losses than we had in the first quarter a year ago. Homeowners premiums grew 4% for the quarter, and the combined ratio was 80.1 compared to 94.8 in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 1.9 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the first quarter of 2012, compared to 12.3 points in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding cats, the 2012 first quarter homeowners combined ratio improved to 78.2 from 82.5 in the same period a year ago. ","Personal auto premiums increased 1% and the combined ratio was 91.3 compared to 92.8 in the first quarter of 2011. The modest growth of personal auto for the quarter reflects the couple of points of negative impact from currency translation. In other personal, which includes our accident, yacht and personal excess liability line, premiums were up 11% and the combined ratio was 97.3 compared to 92.2 in the first quarter a year ago. About half the increase in the combined ratio was attributable to the accident business and the balance was due to a couple of large losses in personal excess liability. ","In the U.S., the first quarter of 2012 was the sixth consecutive quarter of growth in both premiums and in force count, for homeowners and personal auto. New business was up 3% overall in Personal Lines. Policy retention was 91.2 for homeowners and 88.8 for auto. These retention rates were consistent with the fourth quarter of 2011 and were each up almost 1 point from the first quarter last year. ","In the first quarter of this year, we achieved homeowners rate and exposure premium increases totaling 4%. In addition, we have filed for rate increases, which should result in renewal premium's increasing by about 6% on policies expiring at the end of 2012. In short, we are very pleased with the performance and prospects of Personal Line. ","Turning now to claims corporate-wide, the relatively mild winter in the U.S. made for a much quieter quarter than the same period last year. In the first quarter of 2012, the cat impact on the combined ratio was only 0.8 points, reflecting roughly $45 million of losses from 6 cat events in the U.S. and 2 events outside the U.S., partially offset by about $20 million in downward revisions to our estimated losses from catastrophes, which occurred in 2011. In particular, Hurricane Irene continued to develop favorably. ","Now, I'll turn it over to Ricky who will review our financial results in more detail.","Richard G. Spiro","Thanks, Dino. As usual, I will discuss our financial results for the quarter and I will also provide an update on the April 1 renewal of our major property reinsurance program. Looking first at our operating results, we had solid underwriting income of $303 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down slightly to $308 million due primarily to lower reinvestment rates. Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $56 million or $0.13 per share after tax. For comparison, in the first quarter of 2011, we have net realized investment gains before tax of $160 million or $0.35 per share after tax driven largely by gains from our alternative investments. Unrealized appreciation before tax at March 31, 2012 was $2.8 billion compared to $2.7 billion at year-end 2011.  ","The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was 42% as of March 31, 2012, and the composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.6 years and the average credit rating is Aa2. We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company, at March 31, 2012, our holding company portfolio at $2.1 billion of investments, including approximately $800 million of short-term investments. ","Book value per share under GAAP at March 31, 2012 was $57.37 compared to $56.15 at year-end 2011. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate was available for sale fixed maturities at amortized cost, was $51.58 compared to $50.37 at 2011 year end. ","As we have previously disclosed, during the first quarter of 2012, we adopted new guidance related to the accounting for cost associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts. We elected retrospective application of the guidance, which reduced our deferred policy acquisition costs as of December 31, 2011 by $420 million or 26% and reduced shareholders equity by $273 million or approximately $1 per share. These adjustments are reflected in the book value per share amounts that I just shared with you. The adoption to this guidance did not have a material effect on earnings in either the first quarter of 2012 or 2011. ","As for reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the first quarter of 2012 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows: In CPI, we had about $30 million, CCI had about $20 million, CSI had about $40 million and reinsurance assumed had about $10 million, bringing our total favorable development to about $100 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the first quarter combined ratio of about 3.5 points overall, including almost 3\/4 of a point of favorable development from prior-year catastrophes. For comparison, in the first quarter of 2011, we had about $220 million of favorable development for the company overall, including $40 million in CPI, $100 million in CCI, $75 million in CSI and $5 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2011 was about 7.5 points. ","During the first quarter of 2012, our loss reserves increased by $46 million, including an increase of $75 million for the Insurance business and a decrease of $29 million for the reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The overall increase in reserves reflects a decrease of $114 million related to catastrophes. And the impact of currency translation and loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $10 million. ","Turning to capital management. We repurchased 4.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $301 million during the quarter. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $68.44 per share. At the end of the first quarter, we had $963 million available for share repurchases under our current authorization. And as we said on our last earnings call, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2013. In February, our Board raised the quarterly common stock dividend by 5% to $0.41 per share or $1.64 on an annual basis. This was our 30th consecutive annual dividend increase, a continued indication of our consistent performance and financial strength in a cyclical industry. ","Before turning it back to John, I would like to say a few words about our reinsurance program. On April 1, we renewed our major property treaties, including our North American cat treaty, our non-U.S. cat treaty, and our commercial property per risk treaty. All of these programs provide coverage similar to 2011 with the same starting retentions, although we did made changes in some of the other layers to help us better manage our exposures and costs. For example, we increased our participation in the first layer of our North American cat treaty while also purchasing additional coverage in 3 of the higher layers. We took a similar approach in other 2 treaties, and all of these changes will be outlined in our first quarter Form 10-Q. ","The reinsurance market was orderly and there was capacity to meet our needs in each treaty. As you know, reinsurance pricing is on the rise for the industry and our program was no exception. We paid a mid-single-digit increase for expiring limits, although after taking exposure into account, the overall price increase was in the low single digits. However, based on the structural changes we made, we managed to reduce our overall cost for the 3 treaties as compared to last year. In addition, we successfully completed our fifth catastrophe bond, East Lane V in March, to replace our maturing cat bond. The transaction was very well received by the market, and this enabled us to replace the existing limit and expand the geographic area and perils covered relative to the expiring arrangement at attractive pricing. Under this new arrangement, we purchased $150 million of fully collateralized multi-year coverage to supplement our reinsurance program for the perils of hurricane and severe thunderstorm in the Southern part of the U.S., running from Texas to North Carolina. ","Similar to our previous cat bonds, we have an indemnity-based trigger, which means that our right to collect is based on our actual incurred losses as opposed to industry or index-based losses. In light [ph]  to diversification that these cat bond arrangements bring to our overall reinsurance program, importantly, they provide us with a cost-effective fully collateralized alternative to traditional reinsurance with pricing locked in for 3 or 4 years. ","And now, I'll turn it back to John.","John D. Finnegan","Thanks, Ricky. Chubb performed extremely well in the first quarter. From a financial perspective, we operate income per share of $1.70 with an annualized operating ROE of 13.8%. Book value per share increased to $57.37 per share, up 2% from year-end 2011 and 10% from a year ago. We're especially pleased that our x cat accident year combined ratio improved to 92.1 from 95.8 in the fourth quarter of 2011, largely reflecting more benign loss activity this past quarter. ","With respect to rates, we saw improvements on all fronts. In the U.S., average renewal rate increases in standard commercial reached 8% in the first quarter of 2012. As a rate improvement, which began in the second quarter of 2011, continued to accelerate. ","In professional liability, rates have been lagging but average renewal rate increases rose sharply to 4% in the first quarter, up from 1% in the fourth quarter last year. ","In summary, we had a very good first quarter from a profitability perspective and continue to be encouraged by rate developments in the marketplace. ","And with that, I'll open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That was a broad question on, I believe $100 million of total reserve redundancy is the lowest we've seen in many years. Could you elaborate on changes you're seeing in regards to reserve trends?","John D. Finnegan","I don't know that we have any trends. Let me say that we've been posting a remarkable amount of favorable development for the past number of years. And I think I have in many occasions, as we looked at the upcoming years, profitability outlook suggested that these are unsustainably high levels. Now, that tended to be premature and we still ran some pretty good levels. We had a quarter a few years back where we felt almost these kind of levels, but then it reverted back up again. So really not too much for the client till this past quarter. ","Looking forward, I think this  reinforces the view  that 7 points is a favorable development. It's not sustainable indefinitely. But at the same time, I don't believe that you should simply extrapolate our first quarter development level to the rest of the year in looking at  development for the balance of 2012. Obviously, we'll assess our position as a result of the loss of experience we see over the remainder of the year, and there's no way to project that at this time.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The last quarter in specialty commercial, you had talked about some issues in professional liability in a couple lines there. Are any of those issues persisting in terms of higher loss cost trends?","John D. Finnegan","I think loss cost trends for professional liability are higher than they would've been a couple of years ago and the first half of last year. I think first quarter, the loss trends we saw were maybe some of the lines like crime and fidelity probably a little bit better than the fourth quarter of last year.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Then lastly, so last quarter you had combined ratio guidance in 93 to 95 for the year, would any of the results over the last quarter change that guidance?","John D. Finnegan","We don't have guidance till the end of the second quarter. We think the first quarter was a pretty good quarter overall, but we'll take a look at it at the end of the second quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next to Keith Walsh with Citi.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question, just looking at your retention seems to be holding in very well considering the rate you're getting. Can you just talk about the trend you saw in the quarter by month of how rate came into the book. And I've got a follow up.","John D. Finnegan","I think that the rate by 6 standard commercial incrementally improved over the quarter. But I mean -- but I don't know if you could read a lot of the improvement from 6 to 7 to 8. I mean, that they're rounding there in some cases. But the end of March, and March was a better month than January. And I think, in professional liability, certainly that was true too.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, Ricky, just thinking about the written surplus, you're writing well below 1:1. What's the optimal level that you think about with your franchise and you're assuming your current business mix?","Richard G. Spiro","We don't really have a target, Keith, that we're shooting for. We're comfortable where we are now. We think we have a very strong capital base. We think we have strong excess capital position. So we think we're ready to -- we can take advantage of a growing market. We have capital to return to shareholders, through our capital management program. But we don't really think about it as a targeted premium surplus ratio.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, maybe asking in a different way, how could you -- how high could you go with that ratio? Would you feel comfortable with the current mix of business?","Richard G. Spiro","Same way we don't -- I'm not going to tell you we have a target. I'm not going to give you a number how comfortable we can go.","Operator","And we'll go next to Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Just going back, I guess, to the broader discussion on the margin expansion. We had touched upon that last quarter, and at that time you had suggested that net net, when you look at 2012 accident year, the margin improvement would be neutral based on the rate being offset by loss cost. I'm wondering just based on the momentum you have gotten this quarter, has your thought process on margins changed?","John D. Finnegan","Well, I wouldn't say materially changed. Let's clarify a few things. In CCI, we're writing -- our renewal rate increases are 8%. Let me make it clear that we think that is significantly in excess of our loss cost trends. So we're definitely right here on a pro forma margin expansion basis. What you're referring to and properly so is that, I've pointed out that earned premium comes in at a lagged basis. So, for example, in the first quarter, CCI had great renewal rate increases of 8%. They had earned premium increases of 4% to give you an example. Now, if we had rate increases of 8% for the rest of the year, for example, you tend to get to the effect that you'd almost be at 8% in earned premium in the U.S., but in a worldwide, you'd probably be closer to 5% or 6%. But 8% by the fourth quarter, 6% for the year. ","So now you're starting to  earn some premium. I would think that, that would be after margin expansion plus central [ph] in it. That, of course, though, is a function of loss trends. Now we use -- for this, we use longer-term historical loss trends that might be around 4%. For 5 years, up through the middle of 2011, we experienced much lower loss trends. In the second half of 2011, we have higher loss trends. In the first quarter, we reverted back to more benign loss trends. So in any given quarter, any given couple of quarters, take the side to the theoretical margin expansion, the accident year, moving accident year combined ratio does not only a function of longer-term trends but actual loss experience. ","So let me give you example on the good side in the first quarter. CPI, the CPI's extremely good results were not the result of longer-term trend lines. They were helped greatly by -- although it was awful good -- they were helped greatly by the fact that we had benign losses largely related to non-cat weather-related losses being significantly down. ","Certainly in commercial class is you're going to see similar things, where property losses are up or down in a given quarter, above or below the regression line. So a long-winded way of saying at CCI, what we're writing now is definitely that at these rates is margin expansion in the future, assuming historical loss trends, but probably until the third or fourth quarter you're not going to see the earned rate yet over those long-term loss trends. ","And in CPI, I think you got a similar consideration. Although again by 2013 in both of these businesses, we should, we should have margin expansion. Professional liability, a bit more complicated and more a function of -- systemic losses presence perhaps [indiscernible] in any given year.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Net net modest margin improvement versus prior thought process of neutral?","John D. Finnegan","I would say that I think marginally, maybe -- marginally better maybe in CCI. But again, I think that's subsumed by what happens in any individual quarter based on what losses are in any given quarter, which aren't necessary related to the loss trend.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Got it. It's very helpful. And one quick follow up on the prior question on the CCI reserve release of $20 million. Maybe I missed this, there weren't any negative offsets, right, in terms of the reserve development, i.e., there wasn't any modest adverse development in any line offsetting the positive releases. Did I get that clear or--","John D. Finnegan","Which class of business are we talking about?","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","CCI, the CCI, the $20 million reserve releases you had. That's a clean reserve release number. There's no offset. There are no pluses or minuses in that number.","Richard G. Spiro","Well, actually, there are some pluses and there are some minuses. So maybe I can walk you through and tell you some of the components. And I'd also like to point out that when you think about CCI, they experienced an unusually high amount of favorable development in the first quarter of last year, almost 8 points, really throughout 2011. But with that background, first, the short-term property classes, which are for us are property Marine classes and our CMP property combined, based long for making a slightly favorable prior period development contribution in the first quarter of 2011 to making an adverse contribution in 2012. And this was driven mainly by first quarter case reserve activity on the small number of large complex claims that occurred last year but were still being evaluated at year end. CCI also saw a reduced amount of favorable development in the long tail classes particularly in the casualty line, which continued to develop favorably this quarter but not to the same degree as in the first quarter of 2011. And here, too, we experienced more large case reserve activity in the first quarter of 2012, driven by the primary general liability portion of the book. I hope that gives you at least some color on what happened in the quarter.","Operator","Then we'll go next to Greg Locraft with MSSB.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just again, I guess, most companies would kill for 90 combined in the 13 ROE. So the bottom-line results are great. The pricing is great. But the reserve release, as others have mentioned, is the lowest we've seen in a while. And that mixed with the action, your PIK being higher in the professional liability. What I'm trying to tie it to is I can't figure out what loss trend changed given you're also positioned in that line of business? Is if frequency, is it severity, which years have changed, what types of cases have changed? Just any help you can give on what in that line is causing the conservatism to come out last quarter and this quarter for professional liability would be helpful?","John D. Finnegan","Greg, you can't compare it like -- it's the last year. I mean over the course of the year, last year we saw professional liability deteriorate in their results. But listen, in terms of, we could talk about accident year, I mean 25 years. Ricky, then you could talk about lines of business, I think. I mean professional liability have favorable developments this year as it's had in the past from accident year 2008 and prior. But of course, the amount of available favorable development from those years is getting less and less as the years goes on. Accident years 2009 and '11 were close to flat. Accident year 2010 was modestly adverse, and this is driven by the crime fidelity classes and employment practice liability losses that we talked about in our year-end conference call. Although these 2 lines also have some favorable development in all the years. And then Ricky wants to talk about business.","Richard G. Spiro","In terms of -- as I did with CCI in terms of what may have moved in the quarter, the reduction in CSI's favorable reserve development compared to last year's first quarter was in professional liability and was mainly in the D&O and EPL lines. Our D&O reserves results favorably again this quarter but to a lesser degree than a year-ago first quarter. And EPL actually experienced a swing from favorable development in the first quarter of 2011, to slightly adverse development in the first quarter of this year. However, despite these shifts, we still experienced almost 6 points of favorable development in professional liability in the quarter.","John D. Finnegan","On the initial accident year, this initial accident year is about 72 on a loss ratio, which is up a few points from the first quarter of 2011, but similar to the initial professional liability loss ratio for the full accident year 2011. So at fourth quarter 2011, we had a loss ratio of 79 so versus a much better one. We raised our 2011 expectations in the fourth quarter in a few areas. We've talked about them:  Crime and fidelity, employment practices liability, as well as public D&O and part related to merger objection suits. Our overall initial expected loss ratio for 2012 was higher than in the first quarter of last year, but leveled out the fourth quarter of last year, the same as we booked for the full accident year 2011 at year end. We also see the professional liability expense ratio tends to be higher in the first quarter of the year for seasonality, mostly related to level of premiums written. So for example, last year our expense ratio was 30.4 in the first quarter and dropped to 25.8 in the fourth quarter. So we definitely expect to see a decrease in our expense ratio as we go on into the year.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Excellent. And then just jump into the pricing side of the same line. I think you said plus 4 is what you're getting. Is that enough? And you were at plus 1 fourth quarter, plus 4 now, and it seems like based on some your answer, the more recent years aren't quite where they need to be. And you're picking things higher and I understand the expense ratio that was actually very helpful. But can plus 4 become a plus 7, become a plus 10 as the year progresses?","John D. Finnegan","A plus 4 is not enough, no. I mean, that's our answer. Hopefully, that plus 4 will go higher. I mean it looks that little momentum. For a long time it's lagged. It was 0 until -- we only went positive last quarter for the first time in the fourth quarter of last year. So we like the jump in the first quarter. But no, it definitely has to be higher. Now again, so much -- in this business, so much depends on what's happening in terms of systemic events. So a couple of more recent years you were affected by the credit crisis, for example. You take out the credit crisis and all of a sudden those accident year combined ratios are looking pretty darn good. So there are big things that swing the combined ratio in this field. But in terms of loss trends, you definitely need more than 4%. And for a business that hasn't had any rate increases for a long time, we definitely need a sustained improvement in our rates.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the professional liability. If I look at the accident year combined rate or the specialty commercial -- If I look at the accident year combined ratio in the second year, in the second quarter of 2011 is riding kind of 91.5 and now we're up to 100. So I'm just trying to get a better sense of what's to prevent that from keeping to rising into unprofitable accident year territory?","John D. Finnegan","There are no guarantees where it goes in the future. What I will say is if you look at the accident year numbers, you're talking about 69 in the second quarter of last year versus 72 in this year's first quarter, so you're looking at about 3 points of loss ratio. An accident loss ratio, obviously, the rest of the shift was less favorable development. Now we still ran almost 6 points of favorable development in professional liability for the quarter.","Paul J. Krump","And also, Jay, just to point out one thing. I think the numbers you quoted were for CSI in total. So bear in mind that, that would also include our Surety business in addition to professional liability.","John D. Finnegan","The professional liability is close to 99 last year, for example.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, yes. I mean it's a blended number. All right. And then in terms of the...","John D. Finnegan","And Surety this year, the blend is affected this year because Surety is combined is up because of the lower premiums and its impact on the expense ratio. So it has a little bit of disproportionate impact this quarter.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's a couple of point. All right, fair enough. And then on the excess capital position, I mean, I know it's -- to sort of follow on to a prior question, I know it's very simplistic to look at premium to surplus. But this on Chubb's business mix, it's kind of hard to see why the company couldn't be run at a one-to-one premium to statutory [ph]  surplus, which would imply $2 billion to $3 billion of excess capital. And so where are we wrong on that? Why does Chubb seem to be constrained in terms of share buybacks relative to the current year's operating earnings?","John D. Finnegan","Well I think last year we actually did buybacks in excess of our current year's operating earnings, we did. And it's a question of balance. You might see that premium surplus change. If the market improves, you might see that premium to surplus just go up of its own weight without any capital management. So I mean I don't know, it's the balancing. I do think that sometimes in analyst write-ups, I see that excess capital is equated with capital that's totally available for capital management. The truth is once you fall below the excess capital level, you got to raise capital. So no one runs. Even if you $2 billion of excess capital, no one goes out and uses the $2 billion of excess capital. You have to have a cushion. Last year in the fourth quarter, I think our capital position shifted $500 million to $700 million, just looking at our book position due to pensions and due to currency, and it could shift the other way, but it shifted negatively at the end of last year. You saw it in our book value. You could have huge swings. You can have them from catastrophes, but you can also have them from currency. You can have them from investment income, and the impact on pensions. So I just say that excess capital should really not be equated to that's the amount of capital, you should go out and expend. You obviously have to have a cushion, whether it needs to be $1 billion, $2 billion, $3 billion, each company makes its own judgment. And then you got to also have some reserve for the growth of the business. So it's a delicate balancing act.","Operator","And we'll go next with Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a question on what your targeted levels of ROEs are. And you've done well to get an 8% rate increase in the standard commercial this year, and yet you're seeing a little bit of lower retention. So the question is, are you satisfied right now with that 8% rate increase? Or are you seeking for the rate increases on double to 8% for next year?","John D. Finnegan","We'd like to see further rate increases for sure. I mean I think in this business -- and I understand your question, but in this business, I think you recognize that as it relates to profitability, 1 point of rate has a lot more importance on profitability than 1 lost point in retention. So our retention is industry highs. If you look at our movement from the first quarter of last year, when sort of the period in which the industry started its push on rates, I think our decline in retention is about in line with our major competitors and probably the industry as a whole. I think relative industry retention is down in a period of rate increases. I think that when you look at your rate retention trade-off, you have to look at what the economics of the business you're currently writing. Obviously if you have businesses that have 5% ROEs, you can't make the trade off in favor of retention, you got to make it in favor of rates. If you have 18% ROEs, you can do something different. And now, of course, with interest rates continuing to be down, to get the kind of returns you see in last year's business, we're not going to be available on new business writings unless we get a lower combined ratio, which is achieved by some higher rate in the market.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. My second question is on the competitive behavior for lines other than workers compensation and property. I mean are you seeing more competitors also drive for rate increases in those lines?","Paul J. Krump","This is Paul, Vinay. I would say that in the current market, almost all carriers are seeking needed rate increases. And what that means is that more deals are being taken by agents to the market, to see what other quotes are available and to test the market. I think that going back to John's point, that inevitably results in more lost business for incumbent carriers than was the case when the market was soft and carriers were just reducing rates. The net result is that the overall industry retention is down from the levels experienced in 2011. It really -- as it relates to us, we're aggressively pushing renewal increases. That will have some impact on our retention. However, again, I think that CCI's retention coming in at 83%, it's only down 2 points from the fourth quarter and well within the historical range that they have run since 2005. Our professional liability retention was 85%, the same as in the fourth quarter. In both cases we continue to see some of highest retentions in those business segments in the industry.","John D. Finnegan","If you go back to the early 2000s, you'll see that our retentions were at about this level. Our retentions picked up in the later part of the decade. Perhaps that was a mistake because our rates went down. I don't know if we could have influenced the market much, one way or the other. But the fact is we went to historically high retention levels in commercial and specialty. In specialty, we work at any rate, we got 88%, 89% retention level. That wasn't the way we used to normally run. We normally run closer to 83%, 84%.","Operator","And we'll go next to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. One is the -- so the other Personal lines subsegment there, so you're running kind of in that 97 range. I think, Paul maybe might have mentioned up front. The A&H business there, kind of seeing a list of the quantities [ph] . So I guess first question is kind of what happened in the A&H business that caused the declined ratio to rise? And how do you think about where the profitability of this business is and where you think it should be?  And kind of what are you doing to get there? And just one follow-up.","Richard G. Spiro","I'll start with the personal other. Let's start with the personal other line. As I mentioned, it was up for the quarter. If you look at the combined ratio for the full year, it was 95.7. So the 92.2 that I compared it to for the first quarter last year was clearly a particularly strong result. Nonetheless, about half of the increase as I indicated was due to the Accident business. If you look at the Accident business component, part of that was due to the higher losses but also it was the anticipated increase in the expense ratio. As we mentioned before, we're continuing to make investments to grow the Accident business. And given also that the Accident business is growing faster than the other lines within personal other like the yacht and personal excess, we're going to expect that to -- that expensing back to continue. But as we've indicated before, we view that expense dynamic as acceptable because the Accident business is more predictable than the traditional P&C lines and also -- and it requires less capital.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But I guess the question is, isn't that 97 regardless of the delta from last year, is that an acceptable level? Like is that kind of where you want to be for that line? And is it because it's growing, and you like the leverage you can employ, that you're okay with that? Is that how to think about that?","Paul J. Krump","This is Paul. I think what you have to think about, within personal other, there are 3 distinct businesses. So what we look to run the yacht businesses is radically different than what we'd look to run the personal excess business. As respect to A&H, what I'd like to emphasize here is that we see this as a new opportunity for profitable growth. Over the last couple of years, we built a new A&H team. We tapped into some real experts from outside of Chubb's. And Dino talked about we're making infrastructure investments, and that is pushing up the expenses a little bit right now as we build out. Interestingly, the majority of our A&H business is situated internationally with Asia and Latin America being the principal drivers of that growth. We're seeing increased consumer demand for the products as well as here in the United States via direct marketing distribution, such as, like credit card issuers. But we think that the A&H business is going to become more profitable in the coming years, and we see it as a good diversification play for us and one that we're very excited about.","John D. Finnegan","I would say that if you're asking, do we plan to run other personal at 97? The answer is no. And then for reasons, in accident health, while it does have less capital requirements and less cyclicality, that shouldn't be a 97 or 100 business either. That should be low 90s business. So that's where we're planning to get. But it has a lot of startup expenses at this point in time.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just on -- back to professional line for a second, I mean I guess bigger picture. So fourth quarter you printed a 96 combined, you're getting 1% rate. New to lost was 0.7% and retention was 85%. This quarter, you're at 98.5. Retention is still at 85% and new-to-lost business, higher. Just trying to understand, why shouldn't retention or should retention fall if -- more if you're raising rates? Or if the development is for that segment is on professional liability, you kind of running at over 100 here now for some time. How should we think about what you're doing there in profitability on an accident year basis?","Paul J. Krump","Yes, this is Paul here. First of all, at any given quarter, I just want to point out that a retention figure can be a little bit lumpy just depending on do we retain a deal or not retain a deal that we write something new, et cetera. But clearly, as you point out, when we see the retention not move and rates go up by 3, 4 points, that gives us a lot of confidence to move forward, and we're seeing some of those indications in early April. So we're making some progress.","John D. Finnegan","Wouldn't you take it to be that if rates move up, our retention isn't affected too much is that the market must be moving with you. Because if the market is also getting 5 points rate, I mean there should be no reason that retention is declining significantly.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But you're still writing over 100, I guess, is my point. I mean you're writing over 100, why not let that new-to-lost slip or retention fall?","Paul J. Krump","Again, I think that we have to think about professional liability and its multiple segments that we have. So it's not just public D&O where we have some rate need. There's a lot of fiduciary. There's not-for-profit in there. There's errors and omissions. There's employment practices liability. Each one of those has different targets and different levels of profitability right now. And we're pushing those differently obviously.","John D. Finnegan","It's a little long tail line of business with a lot of uncertainty. You could have argued for 7 years, I don't think we ever ran a place at less than 98 in an accident when we went in. And it ends up that those accident years have turned out to be 80s, 70s, 85s and 90s. So I don't know if that orders for the future. But the very opposite of the question was asked before, how come professional liability development is down so much suggests that it was very considerable in prior years, which means that those initial accident years as booked, ended up to be much higher combined ratios than it turned out for those years. So you only really know over the longer term. We did see some increase in losses last year and the impact of that and not getting rate, that obviously put pressure on our profitability. The expense ratio in the first quarter also puts a little bit of pressure on. Hopefully, as we get rate during the year, we improve the profitability in this business. But you can't -- I think you understand, this is a relationship business. You can't -- today you got over 98 to 101, you can't jettison 50%of your customers, and hope to fight another day, right?","Operator","And we'll go next to Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","The homeowners market, a number of carriers are getting more aggressive, trying to raise profitability, is that presenting growth opportunities for you?","Richard G. Spiro","Our target market, obviously, is a very niche-focused in the high net worth. As you can see, our growth was still good at 4%. Our retention is at all time highs. We're pushing for rate increases. But as I've mentioned before, what you see is there's wide-spread rate taking in the business because many personal lines carriers and homeowner carriers start at an inferior profitability position. So that clearly bodes well for us as we go after our business.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then when we look at the combined ratios in auto and home, obviously, there were less cats this quarter. Were they -- was the combined ratio also helped by just less weather in general?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes. Non-cat weather was down considerably in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011, almost a 7-point spread.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, that same question on some of the commercial property lines, CMT,  Property Marine. Were those helped a bit by non-cat weather also?","Richard G. Spiro","Probably. We don't know the exact type of analysis. And property can be so lumpy in losses. Unlike Homeowners, you don't quite get as lumpy in nonweather-related losses. Property is driven by fires and things like that. But I guess, one would think if the weather was more benign, so it's probably down.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One question I have, and this is just kind of a big picture question is not surprisingly, your retention is down. Large competitor of yours has reported a decline in retention year-on-year. But what I'm trying to figure out is where do you think the business you're letting go is actually ending up. Is it a case that it's ending up with other standard commercial carriers right now? Is it a case that we're actually now seeing kind of the natural flow from mid-markets into excess and surplus lines market? I just -- or maybe it's some combination of the both? Just curious of your thoughts there.","John D. Finnegan","Well I think to start off, and I'm sure you know that. But to repeat what might be obvious, a decline is overall -- industry retention it's really from an individual carrier is more of a relative thing. What you're seeing is more people ask for rate increases. You're probably seeing more churning, more quotes going out of the market. But retention is not a zero-sum game. That doesn't mean that someone else is getting higher retention. I mean retention over all is lower from last year. Now that gives you -- on the other side of  the -- it gives you new more business prospects. We see more submissions on new business. But frankly, we, and that other competitor you mentioned, seem to be have not really taken advantage over that for the last quarter or 2 because we are very focused on the underwriting discipline in new business. And new business tends to be less profitable than renewal business. But I don't think there's any odd markets that are picking up the new business. I would suspect that it's your regular commercial carriers that in many cases have to work harder for business than we do, don't have the renewal base we do. And are willing to cut rate to get new business, because it's still very, very competitive.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. Are there any exceptions to that general rule because I think your point is well taken in the sense that the retentions moving as a surprise, it's more an issue of the new-to-lost isn't going up because of the new isn't picking up yet to offset. But are there any exceptions? And I guess I was kind of wondering around some of the Monoline property comments you made, note of -- or that Paul noted in his prepared comments.","Dino E. Robusto","I don't know by the way that new-to-lost is all going down. You've only had a report from 2 carriers probably today, if you have that. So we [indiscernible] when it comes out. But I mean [indiscernible] the rest of them.","John D. Finnegan","I assume that unlike retention new-to-lost does tend up to be a zero-sum game. So someone is picking it up somewhere I mean in terms of the...","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Point taken. I was speaking -- I was just -- to your point that it's not leaving the excess and surplus line markets. It's going somewhere else, it's -- we very well might not cover those companies or they may not be public.","John D. Finnegan","I don't think we've seen any pickup. Maybe a little bit, maybe, but not a terrible degree.","Paul J. Krump","We don't see any one market at your question.","John D. Finnegan","Property looks [indiscernible]","Paul J. Krump","Yes, we're not seeing a single market be some aggressive player out there just scarfing up anything that we're losing, if that's what your question is. But we wouldn't  name anybody on the call anyway.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's right. I just wanted to make -- I was more kind of is it staying in the standard market? Or is it going to E&S market? And if there was any -- so that's fine, I don't want to belabor it. But just following up on the Property Marine and the package business on property, are we -- is that a phenomenon? And is that kind of a one-year underwriting process we should think of where we're going to go through the book over the next 12 years and it just -- and unless more stuff starts hitting, the rest of market starts behaving a little better and more stuff hits your pricing threshold but that growth might be muted there for a period of time?","Paul J. Krump","Let me see if I'm following your question here. I mean clearly the idea of -- we have kind of a two-prong attack on everything that we do in this organization when it comes to underwriting discipline. First thing is as we look at the macro, we look at how we're doing in a product then we look at how we're doing within an industry segment, within that product. Is there a geographical differences that need to be considered, are there size of accounts that need to be taken into consideration. And then we superimpose that, Matthew, with an account tiering process, where we look down and say, \"Okay, now that we've thought about in the macro sense, what is happening with that individual customer? How is their loss experience? What are their net rates that we're charging versus the rest of the book? Who is the agent? How long have we underwritten them? Are they complying with loss control recommendations, et cetera.\" So it really comes down to individual case-by-case underwriting. And maybe just to pick up on some of the themes that I heard a little bit before, that stringent underwriting is also making an improvement, in hopefully in the combined ratio. It's not just taking rate. So that process never stops. But yes, as rates move up, we are very hopeful that there will be more new business in the marketplace that will be at attractive rates for us to write it.","John D. Finnegan","Are you referring to the declines, to new business? [indiscernible] as well?","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All of that makes -- I was actually asking a more specific question, everything you said makes sense. And I'm not disagreeing with that. I was actually just trying to follow up specific to your comments on, you mentioned Monoline property was a notable decliner in the Property Marine section. To some extent, package impacting the CMP line and I was just curious if that -- those specific areas is something what we're likely to see weigh on the -- mute the growth for a period of time.","Paul J. Krump","Okay. I see what you're saying. I hope not. I said that we were getting double-digit rate increases on Monoline property. Quite frankly, that book, and the industry needs it. Catastrophes are alive and well, and people are hurting in that. I think that when the markets soften, the first thing to go was cat pricing. And when we look at some of the major property writers out there, we're running much better numbers, so I'm hopeful that the market continues to move.","Operator","And we'll go next to Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two brief questions. One, in your terminology when there are reductions to prior year's catastrophe losses, is that included in the catastrophe numbers that you're disclosing?","Richard G. Spiro","Yes.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that's net of that?","Richard G. Spiro","It's net of that.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you quantify how much you still got as liabilities for last year's catastrophes?","John D. Finnegan","I don't think we have that answer, off hand. No. We can raise it again on our future call -- well, we don't have that.","Richard G. Spiro","No we're going to.","Operator","And we'll go next to Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two brief questions. One, talking about the professional liability line. I'm wondering just because we've talked a lot about it, but I couldn't, to be honest, totally follow the math. I wanted to know if you guys can give us just what the current accident year combined PIK [ph] was for the first quarter, for that line. And then presumably your actuaries are calculating at rate indication, like a rate need measure. And I sort of asked the question because yields are low, and obviously we're starting to look at things above 100. And this is -- you're one of the largest writers, and I think this is an interesting. It's just an interesting topic for us all to get our arms around. And so how much rates should we be sort of expecting against the acceleration were starting to see here in sort of D&O and then professional liability?","John D. Finnegan","Are you talking about the accident year, loss ratio -- actually a combined ratio for the first quarter?","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes. And if you don't mind, what your rate indications are for it when you actually calculate what the rate need is?","John D. Finnegan","Well, I mean you're talking about the loss ratio at 72. The expense it at 31. And so it's at 103, 104, is the accident year ratio. Again the expense ratio is a little bit, it's seasonally high. I mean compared to -- it's probably 2 or 3 points higher than the average for the year would run. Yes, we wouldn't go and rate it by line. They differ by line. But it's an odd business because it doesn't lend itself to trend analysis as much as some of the other business, let's say, homeowners. So it kind of depends whether the next 3 or 4 years, if you think we have another credit crisis or something like it or not. But having said that, there's a good rate need in this business.  I mean we definitely have a good rate need in the business.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And do you guys think you're ahead of the market on this one? I mean it felt like there was some more commentary on your call than others who are also in this business. I'd be interested in getting a sense of sort of, if that's the case, what sort of things you're doing and where you think others should start to be more aggressive?","John D. Finnegan","I don't think we can say. There haven't been any really -- there's only been one other call, and that call wasn't from a person who's a carrier that's a big player in the market we're in. I don't know that we're ahead of the markets. Back to a question that was asked before, our retention hasn't dropped considerably. That we got -- we've only had one quarterly of really good rate increases. Retention hasn't dropped. So I suspect that the market is coming along. But then it's got to be proved out over the next couple of quarters.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right, okay. And just a final question, with all the changes in your cat reinsurance strategy, did you guys decide to buy more total aggregate limit?","Richard G. Spiro","I don't know if it adds up to total, more -- as I mentioned, we increased, for example, in the North American cat trade [ph] , we increased our retention in the first layer after our starting retention. But then we increased the coverage we got in the other 3. And I don't know the net of that. That will all be in our 10-Q.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I want to shift away from underwriting and talk about investment income. Especially in your numbers,  it looks like your yield was fairly flat, actually up a tiny bit first quarter this year versus first quarter last year. And presumably, the new money yields are below maturing bonds. I'm assuming there's been some sort of shift in your bond portfolio to maintain those yields year-over-year. Is that a fair assessment?","Richard G. Spiro","The first part of your statement is a fair assessment. The reinvestment rates are lower, but there has not been a shift in our bond portfolio to maintain those yields. A couple of things that are going on there, Jay. If you look at and you break down all the pieces, our fixed income, investment income, did decline slightly. But that was offset by a couple of other positives. One being, we got more dividends on our nonfixed income securities. And we also had a couple of small but I'm still -- they are nonrecurring items that came out of some --  are outside the U.S. operation. So net-net, that led to just a small decline in the investment income in the P&C operation. Don't forget, that's only part of the portfolio. The holding company portfolio, the investment income piece, would be in the corporate and other line. And that also was down in the quarter by a couple of million dollars. So given where reinvestment rates are, we continue to believe that we expect investment income to be lower in the coming quarters as we talked about in our guidance. We just had a couple of odd things happening in the quarter.","John D. Finnegan","Plus I think, Jay, you got to -- there's a compounding effect here. The immediate effect isn't as great as you might think. We've talked about $15 billion or so asset maturing over 3 years -- I'll call it $1 billion a year. If you assume that $1 billion of that happened in the first quarter,  you invested for 100 to 150 basis points less. It's over a quarter on average. It ends up to be in $5 million, it doesn't end up to be in $50 million. But that amount is in compound as you get into the second quarter, third quarter and the fourth quarter, as you go to the future years. But the immediate impact is not that huge.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","I'll just be quick. First, do you have the -- you said there were 45 mean [ph] of gross cats. Do you have the breakdown of that, the CPI versus CCI?","Richard G. Spiro","I'll get it to you in a moment.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Okay, so should I ask the next one while you look it up?","John D. Finnegan","Yes, go ahead. Sure.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Okay. And then just to follow up on the professional lines. When you gave the list of where pricing was up most to least, and I think it was up most in private and nonprofit and at the least in public. And I guess that surprised me a bit,  I would have thought the need would be most in public. And I know that private business has been a little bit under pressure. But I always thought of that being your best business. Is the reason the rate increase have worked that way is because that's where your need is? Or is it just at public D&O, you can't get the rate that you need and that's a disappointment?","Paul J. Krump","It's a great question, and the reason is it goes back to that tiering that we go at. We have been pushing for rate in public D&O and a number of those accounts have been walking. So when we think about rate versus retention trade-offs, we think about that by individual product, and then we think about it by what we call our tiering system. So you could think of it as stars. So if it's a 1-star account, it's in our view, not very good, and we look for a very low retention rate there. We think that has as much of an impact if not more than just getting a large rate increase on a piece of less desirable business.","John D. Finnegan","But of course, Ian, you're directionally correct in a sense that you could have rate needs by line of business, it doesn't mean you achieve rates in line with those needs by line of business. I mean it's like saying small cars are underpriced; and big trucks are overpriced. Not much you can do about it maybe, I mean. So we work at it, but it relates to the level of competition in the business, what our competitors do. We certainly need more rate, and we're getting a public D&O, though.","Paul J. Krump","Absolutely.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Is that the -- so it sounds like that's the line maybe you're having the least success so far, is that a fair comment, relative to need?","Paul J. Krump","Again, I gave them in the order that we're seeing it. And again, we're shifting around the portfolio as well. So from primary to excess and [indiscernible] of different accounts. So we think our underwriting actions, quite frankly, when we will work with our pricing actuary, they gave us as much, if not more credit for underwriting actions on the improving combined ratio than just pure rate increase. [indiscernible] I'm saying, there's just a lot of competition out there. So we can't sit back passively, we got to aggressively attack that.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","Understood. And then, Ricky, I don't know, you've given a lot of extra details to some of other lines of business. Is there any extra detail you can give us on combined ratios even just roughly for different parts of professional liability? Is public D&O a lot worse than private? Or EPLI seems a lot worse than maybe some other lines? Is there a way to sort of give us a rank order of which ones has the better or worse combines right now?","Paul J. Krump","We're not going to break that down.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","I thought I'd try.","Paul J. Krump","The other thing I just want to point out here is that public D&O, we've mentioned this many times before, it's a small portion of our portfolio. So again that's why the re-profiling of the book is as important as just taking rate there.","Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital Management, L.P.","And do you have those numbers on the cats, Dino?","Dino E. Robusto","Yes, back to the account of $45 million, it's about 60% commercial and 40% personal.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just -- last quarter, in your budgeting you sort of predicted that you might have some deterioration for 2012 of around 400 basis points between prior development and core margin. I'm just wondering as you got more information, are the results for this quarter in line with your budgeting? Or what came as a surprise over the last 3 months?","John D. Finnegan","I don't know that we have enough information to change anything we assumed. I think that if you just mathematically prorated the income, made cat adjusted it to a 3.5 point rate, you'd say that the first quarter was favorable to the average earnings. You'd have to -- have on a quarter to run 5.50 a share, or something like that. So if you just do farmer's math, that's generally positive. And I think we were happy with the way that CPI performed in the first quarter and the benefits from non-cat-related weather. But at this point, we really not -- we need another quarter to assess where we are versus guidance.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Or I'm asking -- I'm more asking qualitative than quantitative. Is it the quarter serves as -- feel like what your expectations were? Are you surprised by the quarter's outcome or is this kind of in your budget?","John D. Finnegan","I thought it was a pretty good quarter. Yes, I think it was a pretty good quarter.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Finnegan for any additional or closing remarks.","John D. Finnegan","Thank you all for joining us tonight.

Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Karen Beyer","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Chubb's March 31, 2019 first quarter earnings conference call.","Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance and growth opportunities, pricing and business mix, and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially.","See our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce our speakers this morning. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll then take your questions. Also with us today to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Evan.","Evan Greenberg","Good morning. We had a very good first quarter, highlighted by good underwriting results, strong premium revenue growth globally, and the best pricing environment in U.S. and London wholesale market in maybe 5 years.","Core operating income of $2.54 per share was up 8.5% from prior year. Book and tangible book value per share were up 4.3% and about 7% respectively in the quarter. We reported a P&C combined ratio of 89.2%, which included 3.8 points of CAT losses, and favorable prior period reserve development of 3.1 points, to $104 million pre-tax.","On a current accident year basis, excluding CAT, the P&C combined ratio was 88.5%, simply world class. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, CAT, prior period reserve development.","P&C premium revenue growth in the quarter, in constant dollars was quite strong, and frankly, better than we anticipated in our plans for the quarter. Net premiums grew just over 5%. Our foreign exchange given the strength of the dollar then had a negative impact of 2.2 percentage points.","During the quarter and through April, the pricing environment continued to improve with overall price change in North America on a written basis equaled the loss cost trend. In addition to property, pricing improved throughout the quarter in many casualty related areas including general casualty, both primary and excess, and D&O and professional lines.","Renewal price change, which includes both rate and exposure, was up over 5%. Retention of our customers remained strong across all of our North America Commercial and Personal P&C businesses, with renewal retention as measured by premium of over 94%. In major accounts in specialty commercial, excluding agriculture, premiums were up 4%. Renewal price change for major accounts was 4.8%, with risk management pricing up 5%, excess casualty up 7% and property up nearly 9%.","Public D&O rates increased 5.5%. In our Westchester E&S business, renewal pricing was up 8%.","Turning to our middle market and small commercial business in North America, premiums overall were up about 6.5%, our strongest quarter in terms of growth since the merger. New business was up 13% and renewal retention in our middle market business was over 91%. Middle market pricing was up 3%. And excluding workers' comp, it was up 4.2%, again, that's the best we've seen in a number of years.","The middle market pricing for primary casualty, pricing was up about 7%. Excess umbrella was up 4.3%, and D&O was up 9%. In our U.S. small commercial business, premium revenue continued its positive growth momentum, with net premiums up over 40%.","In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written in the quarter were up 1%, adjusted for the expanded quota share session we discussed last quarter, net premiums were up about 2.5%. Retention remained quite strong at over 96%, with homeowners pricing was up over 8% in the quarter.","Turning to Overseas General Insurance operations, we had reasonable growth, which we expect to accelerate as the year moves along, particularly in Asia. Net premiums written for our international retail division were up 5.7% in constant dollar. And FX then had a negative impact of 5.8 percentage points. Growth was led by Latin America, premiums up almost 13%, while premiums in Europe were up 4.2%, and Asia was up 4% or 8% adjusting for a onetime positive item last year.","International growth in the quarter was driven by both commercial and consumer lines. Consumer lines were up 6%, personal lines were up 5% and driven by Latin America growth of 17.5% and A&H was up 5%, driven by double-digit growth in both Latin America and Japan.","Net premiums for our London market wholesale business were up nearly 15% in the quarter in constant dollar. As I noted last quarter, this business is growing again on the back of improved pricing after several years of shrinking. Pricing conditions in our international retail and London wholesale businesses vary by line and by country.","Overall rates in our retail were up 2%, while rates in London wholesale open market business were up over 8%. Property up over 8%, financial lines up 13% and marine up about 6.5%, and finally aviation up 18%. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. Since the beginning of the year, we've completed a couple of important transactions that represent important opportunities, which will feed growth in the future.","In January, we entered into a 15-year exclusive distribution agreement with Banco de Chile. The largest bank based in that country. We will distribute life and general insurance products to their customers throughout their branches, telemarketing and digital channels. Banco de Chile has a long track record, it successfully marketing insurance to its more than 2 million banking customers.","In March, we received approval to increase our ownership in Huatai Insurance Group, a holding company of P&C, life and asset management subsidiaries. Huatai Group's insurance operations have more than 600 branches and 11 million customers. With our increased stake, Huatai Group became the first domestic Chinese financial services holding company to convert to a foreign invested joint venture. Our increased ownership is an important milestone towards our future goal of majority ownership.","In closing, we're off to a good start to the year. We're achieving increased growth in many of our businesses globally and momentum continues to build, a benefit of our broadly diversified presence and capabilities. We are experiencing continued and even accelerated pricing increases.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil numbering back and take your questions.","Philip Bancroft","Thank you, Evan. We are starting out the year in an exceptionally strong financial position. We have a very strong balance sheet to support our business activities with total capital exceeding $65 billion. We also have a $105 billion portfolio of cash and investments, it's highly rated in liquid and we generated operating cash flow of $1.3 billion in the quarter.","Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we've returned $702 million to shareholders, including $335 million in dividends and $367 million in share repurchases. Though yesterday, we repurchased shares for over $435 million and an average price of $134.17 per share.","Since the Chubb acquisition, we have reduced our dilution on tangible book value per share from 29% to about 2.5%. Our annualized core operating ROE was 9.2% and our annualized core operating return on tangible equity was 15.1%.","Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $1.6 billion after-tax. There was a gain of $1.4 billion in the investment portfolio due to decline in interest rates and $50 million gain from our variable annuity portfolio, primarily from the improvement in the equity markets. We also had a gain of $150 million from FX.","The current quarter investment income of $882 million was within our previously communicated range. We continue to expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income run rate to be in the range of $880 million to $890 million.","As a remainder, as we discussed previously, we reduced the utilization of our cash liquidity program. On a basis of utilization comparable to last year's first quarter, our investment income would have been $902 million, $20 million higher than reported this quarter. And our interest expense would have been $165 million, also $20 million higher than reported in the quarter.","Pre-tax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $250 million, 90% from weather-related events in the U.S. and the balance from international events, primarily in Australia. The catastrophe losses were about 20% higher than we expected, which was worth about $0.06 on our EPS.","We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $240 million - $204 million pre-tax or $161 million after-tax, which included $61 million pre-tax related to the 2018 crop year loss estimates. The remaining favorable development is split approximately 60% from short-tail lines and 40% long-tail, primarily from accident years 2014 and prior.","Net loss reserves increased $39 million or decrease $63 million on a constant dollar basis, reflecting the impact of prior period development and catastrophe and crop insurance payments in the quarter.","Underlying reserves increased about $560 million. On a reported basis, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 98% for the quarter. After adjusting for the items noted previously, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 86%.","Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.7%, which is in line with our expected range of 14% to 16%.","I'll turn the call back over to Karen.","Karen Beyer","Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good - thank you. Good morning. My first question just, Evan, going back to some of your pricing and loss cost commentary from your prepared remarks, in North America specifically you said that written rate is now equal to loss trend. In your annual letter that recently came out, you did say that pricing in the U.S. and some other market is not keeping pace with loss trend. So is that something that we saw change towards the end of the quarter and into April? If you could just expand on that and then give us your view for the rate versus trend that you see over the balance of this year.","Evan Greenberg","Yeah. First of all, I'll answer your last part. I hardly - if I had that insight, I wouldn't be doing this job if I could read the future that way, Elyse, I would probably be in Vegas. But when I wrote my shareholder letter, it was about 2018 year, and it wasn't about the first quarter of 2019.","And in 2019, in fact, in the first quarter, in total, all lines aggregated, rate on a written basis equaled loss cost trend and that is a change. The rate of increase is accelerating in short-tail and long-tail lines in the United States and in London wholesale in particular.","Elyse Greenspan","Does this feel like a market, where when you think, obviously, you don't want to project going forward? But does this feel like we're starting to get into a market where we can think about seeing some underlying margin improvement given that you made a point of saying that things really improved as we got into April?","Evan Greenberg","Well, I didn't say they really improved. I said, they continue to improve. And I don't want to prognosticate the future. Frankly, Chubb runs a world-class combined ratio. And if we can continue to achieve rate that equals loss cost trend in areas that are adequately priced, that's brilliant. If we can achieve rate in excess of loss cost trend in those areas that need rate, because margin is not adequate, that too is the objective, and we'll how it plays out and whether it continues to accelerate.","I like the tone of the market. I like what I see and what I feel. It's rational and I see what appears to be continued forward momentum.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thanks, and then a couple of just quick numbers questions.","Evan Greenberg","And that's particularly in large account and in E&S business. Middle market, I would make the same comment, but it is not at the same rate of change that I observe in large account and E&S and that is wholesome as I think I can be with you.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. And then a couple of quick numbers questions for Phil. Can we get the FX impact on EPS in the quarter?","Philip Bancroft","Well, it was $23 million.","Evan Greenberg","We gave it on the first page of the press release.","Philip Bancroft","Yeah.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great.","Philip Bancroft","$23 million was the - that's on core operating income and it was about $18 million on underwriting.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great.","Evan Greenberg","And the percentage points are right on the first page of the press release.","Elyse Greenspan","And then, my last question, Phil, you said that net investment income and interest expense kind of had offsetting impacts of the $20 million. Is the Q1 interest expense the right way to think about using that number as a run rate?","Philip Bancroft","Yes, I would say that, I would use the netted number, right. So the - I would take $20 million out of the number that I gave for both investment income and for interest expense.","Evan Greenberg","You would add it to investment income. You'd take it away from interest expense.","Philip Bancroft","Interest income will down to the range of [80 to 890] [ph].","Evan Greenberg","Yes.","Philip Bancroft","And I take it out of interest expense.","Evan Greenberg","Correct.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb","Thanks. Thank you and good morning. For the Chubb team, there's been a number of fairly significant aircrafts, terrorism and likely ongoing cyber claims in the industry. Can you talk about how you manage those exposures and maybe your typical net risk after reinsurance protection on those types of risks?","Evan Greenberg","Well, you're talking about a variety of classes and we don't talk about - I'm not sure we're going to answer much of your question. We don't talk about individual losses. And the net limits we retain per risk really vary by risk and by class of business. And that's not something we really disclose and talk much about. But it's all - it is all rolled up. All the experience related to loss events are all rolled up in that combined ratio you're looking at.","Jay Gelb","It would be fair to say though, Evan, right, that it's - reinsurance is probably a significant risk mitigation factor in those type of exposures?","Evan Greenberg","Not necessarily. You don't know what risks we're on. And so, you're referring right now Boeing and then certain cyber events. And those are just individual insureds. And we're not - and some of them we're on and some of them we have modest exposures, some we have more exposure. It varies a whole lot.","Jay Gelb","Okay. Fair enough.","Evan Greenberg","But I have to say this. There is nothing we see in losses occurring in the industry that gives us any pause about Chubb's underwriting of any of those risks.","Jay Gelb","Understood, okay. And then\u2026","Evan Greenberg","We do - we're underwriters, so we do post-claim underwriting reviews, when we see losses come in and we're in the business of losses. And what we really look for is are we proud of the underwriting, do we think the judgments and the appetite were correct, and the pricing was and the terms and conditions, and there's nothing in what we've seen that gives us pause.","Jay Gelb","I see. Okay. The broader question I had was, clearly, there is some favorable momentum in primarily commercial lines. If 2019 is not a major CAT year like we saw in the past two years, which I believe was the largest ever two-year period for the industry in terms of catastrophe experience. Do you believe that this positive price momentum can persist, if it is not a big CAT year, this year?","Evan Greenberg","I do. Because - look, time will tell. But I frankly do, because this is becoming casualty driven. And remember casualty entails insurance companies, not short-tail property. And casualty, you just all casualty related, so I'm using the term in a broad way with the exception of one or two classes, rate and loss cost trends have been going in the opposite direction. And loss cost trend depending on the class and the jurisdiction have worsened in some cases, because there is more pressure, because of the things that we know.","And the industry has experienced in that. And I think many are just waking up to the results that are emerging for behaviors that have occurred over a number of years. So I think this is a rational reaction and I imagine it to continue.","Jay Gelb","Thank you, Evan. Does that mean that for maybe some of your weaker position competitors that they haven't trued up with their underwriting reserve position might be, if it's going to be the casualty-driven term?","Evan Greenberg","Well, you have to ask them. I'm not - I really can't speculate on that, because I don't know what they know and don't know.","Jay Gelb","Thank you.","Evan Greenberg","If they all want to share their books with me, I'll tell you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","Yeah. Thank you. Thanks. A couple of questions here for you. First one, I just notice North America, a big increase in the amount of ceded reinsurance. Did you change reinsurance buying habits this year?","Evan Greenberg","No. We didn't change. So that would just be idiosyncratic to the business in the quarter.","Brian Meredith","Okay. Just allocation and stuff like that\u2026","Evan Greenberg","No. Risk management or crop insurance adjustments or any of that.","Brian Meredith","Okay. Okay. Excellent. And then, Evan, my second question\u2026","Evan Greenberg","And then you do know though on personal lines we increased the quota share.","Brian Meredith","Right. Right. I was looking more\u2026","Evan Greenberg","We [expanding] [ph] the quota share, as we told you last quarter that has an impact on that line of business. It's not that material to the overall North America.","Brian Meredith","Got you. Got you. I was looking more into your North America commercial operations. It was like 18.5% increase in ceded premium?","Evan Greenberg","Yeah. Not just - that's just the timing quarter-to-quarter.","Brian Meredith","Great. Great. And then I'm just curious, you're making a lot of contingent investments in emerging growth areas, China, et cetera. What are the margins on that business like versus your - kind of overall business? Is it better or worse? How should we think about that potentially over the long-term impacting your business?","Evan Greenberg","Yeah. I think, when you look at the - it varies. When you look at something like Banco de Chile or Banamex or some of the major bank related distribution agreements we have made. Those are at the kind of business that produces is at the lower end of our combined ratio of range. By the nature of the business, its consumer business and small commercial and accident and health, et cetera.","China - and we're not consolidating China now, I hope that will occur in the medium-term, when we cross the majority ownership market. We're in the midst of our activity in front of us is to acquire more ownership. We're engaged in that activity though I can't give a precise timing. The life business is a fast growing business, and it is generating. It is now turning the corner and beginning to generate positive GAAP earnings, and I believe the biggest opportunity in China is Life Insurance.","Brian Meredith","Okay.","Evan Greenberg","Just given them to macro. And we've got licenses, Huatai Life has licenses in all - in fundamentally, all the provinces. And the majority of those offices of 600 or life-related got 43,000 agents. Though, for China, that's small. I can imagine a company with 250,000. It would be years from now.","The P&C business will run a combined ratio that will produce an underwriting profit. And it will - it won't be Chubb's average combined - the average of Chubb's combined ratio. It will be at the higher-end spectrum likely for a while. But that has - that too has very good potential. And I think, when I think of it in the early days right now. As we - when I say early days, the next few years. I imagine that when we consolidate, it will be at least neutral to our ROE.","Brian Meredith","Okay. And does that also go for the PICC relationship we have.","Evan Greenberg","Well, the PICC relationship is different. That's a venture to where we're like really the international arm of the PICC. Our Chinese business, it's overseas. And we do with the underwriting and the servicing and they do the marketing and relationship and sales side of it, and we share the business together.","Brian Meredith","Okay. Got you. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Philips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Michael Phillips","Thank you. Good morning. I kind of want to touch this. A lot of comments on the rates and how they changed now or at the point where as you say were equal to loss cost trend. And it kind of a follow-up, I guess, to Jay Gelb's question a second ago. Maybe you could spend a little more time talking - help us understand the other side of equation, the loss cost trends. You said it worsened this year. It's casualty driven. And the rates and loss cost are moving in the opposite direction, and now it's not the case.","But can you talk a little bit more about what you see in the loss cost? Where are they worsened, and maybe just more to the extent that they are worse this year versus last year?","Evan Greenberg","I did not say they're worse this year than last year. So please listen to what\u2026","Michael Phillips","No. Right. Loss cost trends, it worsened, I heard you said them. Okay.","Evan Greenberg","No. No. I did not say they worsened. So again, please, you'll read the transcript and the question, I didn't say that. I said the overall - overall loss cost is behaving. We haven't seen a deterioration in overall loss cost trend. I was speaking about there are specific classes and that it's a mixed bag of some behaving, some not. And when you rapid altogether, I don't see a deterioration in the overall.","But I did say these rates have not kept pace with loss cost in a number of years. And that naturally from the math is pretty simple as to what that equals. It equals margin pressure. And if you don't have margin pressure then I guarantee you've got reserve pressure.","And that the industry is response to that, right now, I think, is rational. And I see it having legs based on all I know right now.","Michael Phillips","Okay. Thank you for that clarification. I appreciate it. I guess, just a quick numbers question on the reserve side. Do you have any exposure to what - I guess, what [Travers had mentioned for that] [ph] Child Victims Act in New York, and so were there any reserves because of that?","Evan Greenberg","No. Mike, you want to\u2026","Michael Smith","Sure. Evan, you'll recall, we recorded additional IBNR in the fourth quarter response to the difficult environment around molestation and abuse. That was not specifically related to the Child Victims Act, but it was in part a response to the trend in certain states to introduce revival legislation. By the way, I should also remind you a large number of states don't constitutionally allow for such legislation.","At the New York, specifically, it's a fluid situation, it's too early predict the outcomes of any claims since the statue doesn't even take effect until August. So therefore, it's really premature to talk about in the potential impact.","Michael Phillips","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jay Cohen","Thank you. Yeah, just a quick one on the Overseas General business, the - there was the - the development was very minimal in the quarter. I just didn't know if you had any exposure to spillover from events that occurred in 2018?","Evan Greenberg","No. We did not, Jay. We don't actually review much in the way of reserves in Overseas General in the first quarter. It's a couple of regions, there are short-tail business that we review in the quarter. And so you see that sometime just bounce around a bit. But nothing - there was no development in the quarter and we had no [jebby] [ph] development. By the way, which is what everyone's trying to talk about.","Jay Cohen","Exactly. Thanks, Evan.","Evan Greenberg","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning, everybody. First question is around the normalized CAT load. So I think you said that CATs were about $20 million in excess of your expectations. I think that gets about 3.5% CAT load\u2026","Evan Greenberg","It was 20% more than our expectation.","Yaron Kinar","Oh, 20%.","Evan Greenberg","Right.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. I missed that. Okay. That's helpful. And is there a reason that you stopped offering the normalized CAT load in the supplement?","Evan Greenberg","The normalized - oh, the ROE normalized CAT load? John?","John Keogh","We decided to put it into the commentary. There was no conscious\u2026","Evan Greenberg","Yeah, there was nothing - yeah, there was no signal there that we - yeah.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Okay.","Evan Greenberg","There was nothing like we were - we had some change of philosophy or this or that. It wasn't - it was an item that we put in, particularly when we saw - when there was elevated CATs of significance, where it was a real CAT event quarter. And we just didn't see it this quarter is that. That's all.","Yaron Kinar","Fair. And given this quarter was ratably benign quarter from an industry perspective from a CAT load perspective. I guess, I was just a little bit surprised to see the CAT load being kind of close to 4% for the quarter. Are you still comfortable with your longer-term guidance or targets of under 4% for the year?","Evan Greenberg","Yeah. I - we are - we really are and when you think about how we do, which we've been quite transparent and we think that The Street's estimate are a pretty good proxy for what is our own work on expected CAT. And the way it's done. We model, obviously, the perils that have good models, hurricane and earthquake have reasonable models and we model our exposure based on that.","And then, on non-model, tornado activity and flood and the like we look at long-term averages. We trend them, we adjust for our exposure. We adjust for reinsurance. And when you bake all that in, The Street's summary is pretty good. When I look at the number over our quote on quote expected. And expected is a quarter.","In a quarter, you're just going to have volatility around that. And by the way on any annual basis, of course, you're going to have volatility. You're never - it's so hard that you're going to hit the actual expected. You're either going to be under it a little bit, you're going to be over it a little bit. I mean, that's just real world. And in any quarter, you're going to have a little volatility.","Some of that was international related, because we had Australia. And I don't think - I'm not sure how you guys think about all that. And then, the balance was just in the homeowners' line and the winter storms that occurred and that's about it.","So it didn't fuss us at all as we looked at it. And it didn't have us re-imagine CAT losses on an expected basis.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. That's helpful. And then when I look at the expense ratio and overseas general and global reinsurance, it seems to go up a little bit. Is that just business mix shift? Is there an FX impact there? Could you maybe walk us through what drove the increase?","Evan Greenberg","Yeah, in overseas general, very simple, last year we had onetime items that benefited, and they were all around pension and compensation. And they were one time. And that we had over-accrual and that came down. And you normalize for that and the expense ratio is flat.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, and in global reinsurance?","Evan Greenberg","Global reinsurance is a mix of business question.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Thank you very much.","Evan Greenberg","You're welcome.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields","Thank you. Good morning. When we're in an environment where rate increases are matching loss trends, is there an internal expectation that various underwriting efforts should translate into margin expansion, because the external catalysts are neutral?","Evan Greenberg","Very line specific, where lines of business are more stressed or don't meet our combined ratio standards, then there we drive for more rate. We drive for change in terms and we reshape portfolio. And that is actively going on, Meyer.","Meyer Shields","Okay, perfect. That's all I had. Thank you.","Evan Greenberg","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just following up on the question Meyer had, I mean, there is clearly some lines, we're seeing a lot of rate - excess casualty. And you said, plus 7, the middle market was just plus 3. I mean, I don't know, I guess, I'm curious, is there [8] [ph] in the pricing even a good indicator of - on a line-by-line basis of what's happening with margins? Like for instance, are the lines that are getting plus 7 likely to see more margin improvement than the lines that are only getting plus 3 or is that really just based on relative need?","Evan Greenberg","It's all based on relative need. You can't translate it. We can, but we don't - we're not disclosing that and we don't go there.","Ryan Tunis","So what are some areas, where you think that loss trend is - I'm sorry, the rate is below loss trend, what are some lines that jump out to you?","Evan Greenberg","Where rate remains below loss trend? A lot of E&S casualty, it varies by line of business. But rate continues and not below loss trend, it's actually above loss trend. I shouldn't say that, let me take that back. But it needs more rate, because you look at the - you look at the combined ratio starting point in those lines.","I see this - I see stressed lines right now. And the better way of saying it, because I'm not going to give it to you by line, in real specific detail, but I see stressed lines getting above loss cost trend. And it need to, which helps to begin to improve the margin in that area. Now, in many of those areas we shrank and shrank substantially, because that you could see it in our numbers. We talked about it. Go back in how we talked about shrinking our Westchester business, our London E&S business, our reinsurance business, as examples, because of the competitive environment.","And in those areas, some of them have classes where we see growth opportunity right now, because rate is exceeding loss cost trend and it presents opportunity. Some rate is exceeding loss cost trend. We right a modest portfolio, and we're - but it's still not adequate enough where we want to grow that business.","Ryan Tunis","That's helpful. And then, Evan, I know you don't want to prognosticate\u2026","Evan Greenberg","I believe there are some lines - there are some lines where rate frankly is still not adequate relative to loss cost trend. And they're coming up, but they're still not there yet.","Ryan Tunis","Got you. And again, I know you don't want to prognosticate on pricing. But I am curious, how much - how important is - what's going on with reinsurance pricing do you think in terms of - how much primary pricing can continue to improve? Is it such that - as we understand in what happens there, you can tell most of this story or is it still a situation where you have a primary company or [lease are inadequate] [ph] and you think you could continue to have [lease firming in] [ph] primary while reinsurance stays sort of not so spectacular?","Evan Greenberg","Right now, this is primary insurer driven. It's not reinsurance market driven.","Ryan Tunis","Thank you very much.","Evan Greenberg","You're welcome.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Dwelle","Yeah, good morning. Just a question related to the agriculture business with the various flooding and other events that we've seen so far. Does that likely to have any impact on either the premium or potentially how you might think about losses this year?","Evan Greenberg","Frankly, the - let's take it in two pieces. The wet season and how people think about late plantings and all of that. The planting season right now and the pace of it is really the same as last year. And you know how last year turned out. So it's very early days and - but right now planting conditions are pretty good and improving. And then, on the loss side from flooding, most of the flood - most of that flooding occurred in flood plain areas.","And from a loss point of view, therefore it's - when we look at our portfolio, it's really about late planting question. And as I said, we see the conditions of that equal to last year.","Mark Dwelle","That's helpful. Thanks very much. That's my only question.","Operator","And I'd like to now turn the call back over to Ms. Karen Beyer for any additional or closing remarks.","Karen Beyer","Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"5102":["Chubb Ltd (NYSE:CB) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call April 26, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Helen Wilson - Investor Relations","Evan G.

Welcome to the Chubb Limited First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introductions, I'll turn the conference over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Helen Wilson","Thank you, and welcome to our March 31, 2017 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, investment income, pricing and business mix, economic and market conditions and integration of our Chubb Corporation acquisition and potential synergies and benefits. All of these are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent SEC filings and earnings press release and financial supplements, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.","We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in our earnings release and financial supplement, which are available at investors.chubb.com. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer, then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.","Evan G. Greenberg","Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, Chubb had a very good start to the year with strong results. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.2 billion or $2.48 per share compared to $2.26 per share the prior year, up nearly 10%. As a reminder, we closed the acquisition on January 14 last year, so our 2016 first quarter results excluded two weeks of Chubb earnings. For comparison purposes, adding those 14 days back into the last year's first quarter, operating income per share this quarter was up 8%.","When discussing our underwriting results and premium growth, I will occasionally use the term \"as if\" to compare our results to last year's first quarter as if we were one company for the entire quarter and excluding merger-related accounting and underwriting actions. I expect, as the year progresses, we will reduce the need to reference \"as if\" for quarterly year-on-year results comparisons.","Our combined ratio for the quarter was simply excellent at 87.5%. That compares to 90% last year or 88.9% as if we were one company for the full quarter. Total P&C underwriting income of $783 million was up 28% or about 9% as if. The underlying current accident year combined ratio, excluding cat losses was simply outstanding at 88% and better than last year, driven by a strong performance in our core global P&C business in particular. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $836 million, in line with the guidance we gave you last quarter and up 9% over prior year or 3% if we include the investment income for the 14 day stub period.","Chubb's strong earnings produced a good operating ROE of circa [ph] 10% for the quarter, while book and tangible book value per share were up 1.7% and 3.1%, respectively. From post-merger closing to this March 31, book value per share has increased over 9.5% and tangible book has increased about 16%. Bill will have more to say about investment income, tangible book value, and cats, and prior period reserve development.","For the quarter premium revenue growth was about in line with our expectations and what we described last quarter. The same themes prevailed; strong retentions of business, growth in new business over last year's first quarter, but constrained nonetheless due to market conditions, a contribution of new business from cross-selling and the strength of the organization, and a reduction in revenue due to merger-related underwriting actions, including the purchase of additional reinsurance.","As a reminder, the impact from these last items, which this quarter amount to about 3% of P&C net premium, should ameliorate as we move through the year. For the quarter, P&C net premiums were up about 13.5% in constant dollars. Foreign exchange had a 0.5 point impact. On an as-if basis, P&C net premiums were up over 2%. The commercial P&C insurance market is soft globally. And conditions vary depending on the territory, line of business and size of risk. Rates are flat or declining, depending on class of business, size of customer and territory. The rate of decline is slowing, because pricing in many classes has reached or is reaching unprofitable levels. ","On the other hand, there are a few stress classes where we're able to achieve or hold rate. Market terms and conditions continued to soften in a number of classes. At the same time we are discussing rate and term movement, keep in mind, that for the industry, claim inflation is hardly nonexistent and pricing hasn't kept pace, contributing further to industry combined ratios under pressure. And as you have noticed, in fact, loss cost inflation has increased in certain classes while overall reserve adequacy is starting to come under pressure.","As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more competitive than mid-sized. But middle market is incrementally more competitive, particularly in the U.S. and Europe as companies stress about growth and reach more aggressively. Wholesale again is certainly more competitive than retail. Again, like last quarter, certain markets are noticeably more competitive than others. London, Bermuda, and Brazil by example are particularly competitive. While in the U.S. and Continental Europe, competition is a little less ferocious and a bit more orderly but soft or softening nonetheless.","Globally, new business remains harder to come by in what simply can be characterized as a hungry market. Competitive new business conditions are ameliorated for us to some degree where the power of the organization is brought to bear for a client or producer. Also, our total capabilities in terms of product, ability to serve many different types of insurance customers, our deep distribution strength, and extensive geographic reach means our optionality or ability to capitalize on opportunity is exceptional and, by the way, will only improve with time.","Rate movement for the business we wrote in the quarter varied by territory and market segment. Renewal pricing was down about a 0.5% in our U.S. middle market business, with exposure change a positive 0.5%. In our U.S. major accounts business, renewal pricing was down about 1.5%, with exposure change a positive 1.2%. In our international retail Commercial P&C business, pricing was down 2%. By major class of business, beginning with North America retail, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down about 1%. Financial lines pricing was down about a 0.5% and property-related pricing was down about 3.5%. Internationally, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 1%, financial lines pricing was down 1%, and property-related pricing was down 2%.","Now with that as context, let me give you some more detail on our revenue results for the quarter. In our North America Commercial P&C business, net premiums were up over 19%. Normalizing for the 14 days in January and the impact of merger-related underwriting actions, net premiums were flat. The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was 88.5%, with middle market and small commercial at about 87% and major accounts at nearly 94%.","It is worth mentioning that while the overall market is competitive, there are a few classes, such as property and casualty coverage for real estate-related risks, where one or two companies simply for volume, defy any logic and are writing at terms that will produce very large underwriting losses in the future. In these instances, we just walk away. On the other hand, where there is a flight to quality advantage and the strength of our firm stands out, such as in our risk management business, renewal retention can be as high as 100%.","Overall, new business writings for North America commercial lines were up 16% over first quarter 2016. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were up 13%. On an as-if basis, and excluding the 5 point impact of additional reinsurance, growth was about 6.5%. Rates were up over 2% and exposure change added 3%. Retention remained quite strong at over 95%.","Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, net premiums written for international retail P&C business were up 10.5% in the quarter in constant dollars or nearly 6% as if. Growth for our global A&H business was up more than 5% in constant dollars or 1.5% as if, made up of 4.5% in North America, which includes combined insurance and our group A&H business, and about 1.5% in international. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends.","I want to say a few words about integration. Operationally and financially, all areas of integration are on track or ahead of schedule. Integration-related savings are directly contributing to our margins in the face of declining rates and continuing loss cost trends while giving us room to invest in our competitive profile, including our technology, talent, product expansion, and future operating efficiency. Total integration-related savings impacted our combined ratio by about two points.","In closing, there is a combination of strength and stability in our company that is highly attractive to our distribution partners and customers. Our people are intently focused on execution of strategies. We have a lot of energy in the organization right now and a great deal of optimism and passion. Personally, I am confident in our people and capabilities and in our prospects near and long term.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back and take your questions.","Philip Bancroft","Thank you, Evan. Chubb's overall financial position grew stronger in the quarter as we continued to generate substantial capital and positive cash flow. Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $460 million to shareholders, including $320 million in dividends and $140 million of shares repurchased. Year-to-date through yesterday, we have repurchased $200 million.","We also paid off $500 million of debt that matured in the quarter. Our $1 billion of 2007 hybrid notes converted to a floating rate earlier this month, which at current rates will reduce our 2017 interest expense by over $30 million. Investment income was $836 million and was within our expectations. While there are always a number of factors that impact the variability of investment income, we expect our quarterly run rate to remain in a range of $830 million to $840 million.","Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $360 million, primarily from our investment portfolio and principally due to decreases in interest rates. Foreign exchange had a positive impact on book value of $118 million and a small unfavorable impact on operating income of $3 million. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1 billion.","Net loss reserves decreased $191 million for the quarter on a constant dollar basis. This primarily reflects a seasonal decrease in our crop reserves, favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter, and the amortization of the fair value liability adjustment established in purchase accounting. After adjusting for these items, net loss reserves increased by $319 million. The paid to incurred ratio in the quarter was 91% after adjusting for the items noted above. We had positive prior period development of $231 million pretax or $155 million after tax. This included $41 million pretax of adverse development related to the change in the Ogden discount rate in the UK, which impacted our casualty related exposures. ","We also had favorable development of $79 million related to the 2016 crop year loss estimates. The remaining favorable development was split evenly between short-tail and long-tail lines with the long-tail coming from accident years 2013 and prior. Our catastrophe losses in the quarter were $206 million or $164 million after tax compared to $258 million or $204 million after tax in the prior year. Catastrophe losses this quarter were primarily from North America weather events and Cyclone Debbie in Australia.","During the quarter, P&C premium growth was negatively impacted by incremental merger-related underwriting actions and additional reinsurance of $187 million, impacting growth by 3%. In addition, the alignment of accounting policies related to the timing of recognizing premiums in 2016 for certain of Chubb Corp's foreign subsidiaries adversely impacted the quarter by an additional $73 million or 1.1%. When considering these items, P&C premium growth was 2.2%.","As Evan mentioned, our integration efforts are either on track or ahead of schedule. Total incremental integration-related savings realized in the quarter were $124 million, leading to total cumulative realized savings of $449 million. On an annualized run rate basis, savings through March are $710 million. The operating income tax rate for the quarter is 14%, which is below our expected range of 16% to 18%, primarily due to a tax benefit related to our employee benefit programs, including the required adoption of new accounting guidance on stock compensation.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Helen.","Helen Wilson","Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll have our first question from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.","Kai Pan","Good morning and thank you. First question on the cost savings side, does it contribute two points to your P&C combined ratio, I just wondered, do you see potential upside to the $800 million target and how much of that will flow through bottom line versus reinvestment?","Evan G. Greenberg","Upside to the $800 million. We are right now ahead of schedule in our realization of the $800 million on both an annualized and realized basis. We're thoughtfully reviewing where we are. And we will update our views about expense savings we will realize, both annualized and realized, at the end of the second quarter when we do the second quarter call. At that time, I expect we will upsize the $800 million. But beyond that, I'm not going to give you any guidance.","Kai Pan","And how much would that flow through to the bottom line?","Evan G. Greenberg","We're not, you know what, Kai, we're not going there. A substantial portion will flow through the bottom line. It's offset by natural rises in our operating expenses. We're a very efficient company. As you've noticed over the years, we control expenses well, but you still have natural inflation and expense. Then we have investments we're making in the company, technology in particular, though I note that it seems that there is a misunderstanding about how that works. Those are capitalized expenses. You have a timing question. And we hardly -- like anybody, we hardly lay out a model of here's how our -- here's the detail of how our expenses look. So you'll figure that for yourself.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. My follow-up question is, if we step back, look at your earning growth potential, we see your combined ratio is very good and already very good and premium gross profit is limited given the pricing environment and buyback could help EPS a little bit, probably a couple of points. What do you see could drive the EPS higher from here? And what do you see as a sort of earnings power for this franchise?","Evan G. Greenberg","Well, I'm quite bullish about the earning power for the franchise. Margins, as you saw this quarter, are -- the loss ratios naturally rise as you're in a pricing environment that is soft and you have loss cost inflation. And that's ameliorated for us by both portfolio management, choices we can make in terms of where we grow our business, because we have far greater optionality in that regard, which helps to mix loss ratio. And then as you know, we have substantial expense improvements that help margins. ","Secondly, the organization did grow. The underlying -- when you account for the underwriting noise due to the merger and the accounting, underneath it all, we did grow. And that growth was pretty broad-based. And in spite of the world we see, I see momentum. And our -- what we can do internally, the part we control, I see that part only improving and momentum building as time goes on, particularly in that middle market and small commercial business and pockets around the world. Our A&H business and our large account business, which had frankly quite good growth. If you look at our risk management business this quarter, it stood out because of flight to quality and capability and stability that Chubb presents that frankly is a standout. And so -- and then you look at our Personal Lines business that actually showed underlying growth in the quarter. I am quite bullish overtime about our capability to produce wealth creation.","Kai Pan","Great, well thank you so much for all the answers.","Evan G. Greenberg","You are welcome. ","Operator","Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. I first had a question, the cat losses screened pretty low this quarter just given the size of the industry losses that we saw in the U.S. So I was wondering if you can comment just on your exposure and did the rate of reinsurance that you guys purchased last year, did that help to alleviate some of the cat losses in the quarter? And so when we think about Chubb, is your kind of quarterly cat loss load lower now than it would have been for each of the legacy companies?","Evan G. Greenberg","No, the additional reinsurance that we have purchased really didn't have an impact on ameliorating cat loss in the quarter. We set our appetite on cat losses as a percentage of capital in particular. And frankly, the cat losses in the quarter, it's geographic, it's where they hit. And they happened to hit where we had less concentration.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thanks. And then can you provide, I mean your opening commentary, you spoke about higher inflation for the industry. Can you give a little bit more color by line, where you're seeing greater inflation? And what prior periods would you potentially compare the inflationary levels we're seeing today within the property and casualty industry?","Evan G. Greenberg","Yes, I'm not going to go on that part. But look, you can see it pretty simply, you see it. Anything with wheels on it has inflation. That doesn't take a genius. And on Professional Lines, I would call out in particular, where D&O is experiencing more inflation and you're seeing it in security class action, in particular merger-related objection, in particular employment practices liability, in particular there is inflation. And you don't just see it in the United States. You see it on other geographies around the world, such as Australia, such as security class action beginning in Europe and the UK. You're seeing more of that. So those are two examples for you.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then just, Phil, on the Ogden charge in the quarter, did that hit both overseas gen and reinsurance?","Philip Bancroft","There was about $8 million in reinsurance and the remainder was in COG.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then do you have a share repurchase update as of quarter-to-date?","Philip Bancroft","Year-to-date, as of yesterday, was $200 million.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much. ","Philip Bancroft","You are welcome. ","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Gelb, Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Thanks very much. Evan, I had a couple follow-ups with regard to your annual letter. In 2017...","Evan G. Greenberg","You read it, did you?","Jay Gelb","With great interest. In 2017, I think I believe you said we should expect growth from Chubb in constant dollars, even while taking into account the soft market conditions. I know you touched on in your prepared remarks, but if there's any other insight you could add on that, that would be helpful? Thank you. ","Evan G. Greenberg","Yes. I said to you that in the last earnings call, I believe that, look, first quarter would look to a degree like fourth quarter, you'd begin to see the amelioration of some of the underwriting actions we took, etcetera. And that minus 1.9% or 2% was less than you saw in prior quarters. Secondly, the normalized for all that, and I hate as if and I hate noise, you want it just as published. And we're getting there. But the underlying of 2% growth is an improvement. And it's pretty broad-based to me. When I look at it by region, I look at the P&C business broken down between its various segments, between its various lines of business. And I see a building momentum in that regard, but offset by what you have to do in underwriting to maintain margins. ","I'm not looking for this company to be publishing mid-90s combined ratios. And that means on various portfolios, as pricing or terms reach a point, you have to be disciplined and trade growth for underwriting discipline. I think that we're showing great restraint and great discipline in that regard of underwriting and at the same time, getting more and more after the growth opportunities that you put them all together and that you can produce combined ratios like that and grow on the underlying at 2% or greater. That's a pretty good trick to me. And I expect, as I say, in certain areas where we really see opportunity for that to continue to build momentum.","Jay Gelb","That's helpful. The other area of the letter that really caught people's attention was the unfavorable comment on the insurance brokers, can you give us some insight there in terms of what issues you see as most problematic?","Evan G. Greenberg","Yes, you made me win -- I won the bet because of your question. I knew, I believed this question was going to come up. Look, I want to put a little context around this, and then I want to just expand on my comments. And this is hardly some cause celeb for me. It was one comment out of a letter that commented on many things in the industry and beyond the industry. ","Chubb is an agency and a brokerage company. We are not a direct writer. This is our chosen form of distribution. Now one of the reasons, one of the main reasons I am a firm believer that brokers and agents, intermediaries, provide a necessary role in the selection and market-making function in our business. And if they didn't, then frankly there wouldn't be a -- there wouldn't, long term be a place for them. In a market-based economy, if you don't really have a role that's necessary, you soon disappear. I believe it is a vital role in our business. And agents and brokers are our partners. ","In brokerage, it's more ambivalent. It's by the nature of brokerage. They represent a client. In agency, they truly are an extension of us, they represent us, and they are our partners. My comments came about because I've been in this industry for over 40 years. I care about this industry and I care about its long-term health. I was referring in particular to the facilitization of business that I see, predominantly that we see, predominantly but not exclusively in the wholesale markets. And I think some of that behavior has gone beyond what is reasonable. ","How does it look? The broker, particularly in the wholesale area, will box up, will collect the class of business for efficiency's sake into one portfolio. Business that was placed at one -- as one-off risks, particularly smaller and midsized risks, but not exclusively. It could be just simply a class of business. But they bring it all into one place and so there's a lot of volume. And so in the first instance, it's spoken of as efficiency. But that volume is used to attract underwriters, who no one comes with clean hands, who for the sake of volume will do things to pricing and terms and conditions that aren't that prudent, that aren't sustainable, and that they otherwise wouldn't do when its one-off risk placed. ","And then for the sake of efficiency, it is more efficient for the broker to place it this way, more efficient for the underwriter, in some cases, to receive it this way, but not in all cases. Compensation goes up. Price goes down, compensation goes up, what's the logic of that? And frankly, in this world today, a digital world where there is greater efficiency and greater transparency, what industry or business do we know about where prices are going down but intermediary percentage of the dollar of what's being placed goes up. And that's what's occurring in the facilitization of the business. I don't think it's advisable. I don't think it's in the long-term interest or even the medium-term interest of our business, of our industry. I don't think it's sustainable. And I say it because I care about the industry. And I think like every other industry, those who are knowledgeable of markets, who are knowledgeable of how to use technology in markets, they will notice this, and change will come, without a doubt in my mind.","Jay Gelb","Thank you for that and if I could just focus on one separate issue, given your position in the industry, given the media speculation on the CEO transition that looks like it's forthcoming at AIG, any perspective you'd like to provide on that?","Evan G. Greenberg","No. I wish them well. I'd like to see a healthy AIG. And I can guarantee you Chubb's ability to thrive and to execute our strategy is hardly based around a competitor stumbling or not thriving. And I'd like to see a healthy company. So I wish them well in their selection.","Operator","We'll go next to Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Cohen","Yes, a couple of numbers questions. So I believe you said there was an accounting adjustment on the premiums of $73 million, I guess it was a negative, does that continue going forward or was that a one quarter issue?","Philip Bancroft","It looks like it will also recur in the fourth quarter in the neighborhood of $50 million. But then second and third quarters are immaterial impacts.","Jay Cohen","Okay. And then beyond this year, there's no impact?","Philip Bancroft","No, that's correct. It'll all be over this year.","Jay Cohen","That's helpful. And then secondly, on the administrative expenses in both U.S. personal and U.S. commercial, that number dropped quite a bit from where it had been running for the past couple of quarters. And obviously, you're recognizing some synergies, but it was a pretty notable drop off. I understand that there was a pension benefit essentially versus a year ago and I'm wondering if you could break that out, I want to see how much the number came down beyond just the pension change?","Philip Bancroft","The expense savings, the incremental expense savings over the first quarter of last year was $124 million. The pension change was not included in that number. That's an additional $28 million that's been allocated to the units.","Jay Cohen","And that's mostly in the U.S.?","Philip Bancroft","It is mostly in the U.S. but it's spread amongst the units. Actually no, the pension change was all in the U.S., sorry.","Jay Cohen","All U.S. okay, that is helpful. Thanks a lot. ","Operator","And next, Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","Hi, good morning, thanks for the call. We're past the -- you are past the deal with between ACE and Chubb and we have an ongoing soft market. What does that mean from a capital management perspective, would we see continued higher dividends and perhaps more stock repurchases as the benefits of the deal come through?","Philip Bancroft","We've said we have an authorization of $1 billion for this year, and we have no plans beyond that.","Evan G. Greenberg","No change to our playbook. ","Paul Newsome","Steady as she goes, okay.","Evan G. Greenberg","That is right, there is -- Paul maybe to go a step further. There was no surprise to us in the landscape you just painted. There has hasn't been a change to us. It's a year since the merger, going well. The market is soft, the market was soft, the market is soft. That's exactly within our expectation. And so actually, there is no change in what we see internally and expected of ourselves. And there is no change from what we expected to the external environment.","Paul Newsome","That's great. And what about the M&A outlook at this point? Again, through a good chunk of the merger integration, do you think -- should we expect to see you more active in the market?","Evan G. Greenberg","No, I'm not comment -- I'm not going there. I'm not commenting on -- we have plenty to do in not only completing integration, but in unlocking the power and potential we see of this organization. And if we never do another deal, the value creation potential we have in our hands is enormous, simply enormous. And from both the product, geographic, customer perspective, God, don't lose sight. This is P&C industry is, what, about $2.5 trillion a year of business. We write about 1.5% of it, almost a rounding of it. And we have, what, something like 10 countries that we do over $400 million a year in, a hardly excessive market penetration. And the opportunities, when you put together the capabilities and knowledge of both organizations is simply stunning. And the only thing that stands in the way is you got to maintain or you got to balance it with underwriting discipline when people are doing dumb stuff. So over any period of time I look at this organization, we're going to win and we're going to outperform. And there are going to be moments in every micro market and in every product area where there's, because the world doesn't move in lockstep, where we're going to be able to just zip ahead. So in that regard, forget about M&A, stay tuned.","Paul Newsome","Fantastic, I will stay tuned. ","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Meredith, UBS.","Brian Meredith","Yeah, a couple of quick questions for you. First one, I'm just curious on the homeowner's business, how much of the growth that you're seeing right now is rate versus unit volume growth? Because I know you've been taking potential price increases on the Fireman's Fund business.","Evan G. Greenberg","So we told you -- in my commentary, I told you 6.5% growth normalized and that there was three points and two points between rate and trend. So rate and trend was about 5% together, and overall, we're up 6.5%.","Brian Meredith","Okay. Just unit growth, great.","Evan G. Greenberg","Hold on, Paul Krump is going to expand on that.","Paul J. Krump","Yes, hi Brian, it's Paul. Just a couple of thoughts there. Just wanted to note that the first quarter growth was a little bit higher than the previous run rates because there were some timing issues related to the integration and some of the impacts from ending the Fireman's Fund conversion. So, I think that the run rate is really long term I think, right now, we're seeing around 3%, 4%.","Brian Meredith","Got you, great. And then, Phil, just quickly back on the administrative expenses, just to follow-up on Jay's question. So the pension's all going through the admin line right now, but still a pretty substantial decline on the year-over-year basis. Was there any shifts with respect to kind of reallocation of kind of expenses this year versus last year versus loss in administrative expenses?","Philip Bancroft","It was. There was. There's about $24 million that moved from administrative expenses to ULE of our loss costs. That was just an attempt to make the policies consistent between Chubb Corp. and Legacy ACE.","Brian Meredith","Makes sense. Thank you. ","Operator","Ian Gutterman, Balyasny.","Ian Gutterman","I guess I was hoping you guys could expand a little bit on the comments on incipient loss cost inflation and just what drivers you're seeing in the environment. And I guess if I throw out a few, maybe to prompt a response, is this the delayed impact of more liberal judges appointed, is it the populism we've seen across the country showing up in the jury box, or is it something more close to home and to the industry meaning to say, terms and conditions have deteriorated and things that wouldn't have prompted a lawsuit, now that plans bar sees a hole they can drive through and takes you to court?","Evan G. Greenberg","Yes, I'll come to that. Let me go a step further beyond Professional Lines and commercial auto. We regularly look at portfolios and it happened just last week, a group of us spent many hours doing the deep dive with our casualty folks from around the world, going through all casualty portfolios and giving updates on what we see in pricing and trend. And our updated look at trend right now, it's a -- the casualty-related trend primarily is running around 4%. And so you'll say, well, that's not 5%. And we see the same thing in comp, by the way. And so that's not 0%. And that's my point. While it's still a little tamer than what we had seen historically in the past, you take 4% that goes year-over-year-over-year-over-year and you got prices that are flat or down, well, do the math of what happens to loss ratio and what you do with risk selection, et cetera, and portfolio management or terms to alleviate, that plus expense are your anecdotes. But other than that, it does grind.","When it comes to Professional Lines in your question, it is about the external environment and I'll ask maybe John Keogh and John Lupica, who both grew up in the business, to speak, maybe give you a few comments. But I would tell you this. It's not that we're seeing populism. Remember this doesn't happen on a dime or appointments of judges recently. Appointment of judges, that has occurred for the last 8 years. You've stacked a more liberal court, on one hand. But what we're also seeing is a change in the plaintiff bar environment. There are more plaintiff bar law firms, more boutique law firms who are like ambulance chasers and out to make a buck. And it's attacks on society, by the way, it's attacks on corporations and it's a problem where anything that represents any kind of bad news, that is natural exposure to any kind of business, and by the way, this is not restricted to one industry like health care or I read some of that and that's just not right. It's very broad-based. And there's not a merger that goes down where there isn't a lawsuit filed on both sides. You paid too much, you paid too little. And do these get settled? They get settled to reduce its money, but it's still money and it increases the frequency. And then security class actions around absolutely everything. And then employment practices liability, as an example, has found its way into higher-paying jobs, when it seems as part of layoffs today that, okay, another retirement benefit you get or another benefit you get is a payment from an EPS. That's the kind -- that's just what's going on. Now I'll ask my colleagues if they want to answer that.","John Keogh","As you see, this is John Keogh. As usual, Evan, I mean, you've kind of covered all. I would, just for color, make the point that when I was deep into the D&O business 15 years ago, there were a handful...","Evan G. Greenberg","Did you say 50 years ago?","John Keogh","15, not that bad. Feels like 50 though. 15 years ago, there were a handful of plaintiff firms that drove all the litigation, at least here in North America. Today, when you look at the list of plaintiff firms, and most of them are led by people who worked at those handful of firms who've gone out on their own, there are dozens firms today, all of whom are going to work every day with the ambition to make money and find ways to create new theories of litigation, new theories of liability against corporate America. And I think that is a fundamental change in the business that they we're witnessing in terms of the frequency of claims in the D&O business that is not, in my mind, a temporary change. It's a secular change. This is going to be with us and probably there's a dozen more firms in the next 5 years, that wouldn't surprise me, that are making a living doing this. And then outside the U.S., in Australia and UK, they see what goes on here, the lawyers. They see an opportunity. And the thing I would add that Evan did not mention is litigation funding, right? Whether it's here in the U.S. or in UK or in the Australia. Right, there are funds, right, that are attracting some serious money to fund the litigation in the D&O world, which obviously creates more both frequency and severity in this business than we've seen before.","Ian Gutterman","Got it. And if I could sort of tie that in...","Evan G. Greenberg","John Lupica says we've wrung it dry.","John Lupica","I think you guys got it.","Ian Gutterman","Just to tie that in, Evan, with your comments in the press release about the softening market. And when I think about a sort of true soft market bottom, I guess, I think more than just price, I think about terms getting worse and winning business through that. I mean, we've seen, obviously, maybe one example is a program business where a lot of people are starting to get burned and I kind of wonder if that's terms and selection. And the other is reserves, right? And just when I look at reserves, you see across most liability classes and Professional Lines a lot less IBNR than you would have seen three years ago, five years ago. Do you look at those type of signs and say, boy, it's really -- maybe it's not 1999, but it's the seventh inning or the eighth inning and all the same things are repeating and it's more than just price or is it really just we're still in that pricing stage and the rest of it doesn't worry you as much yet?","Evan G. Greenberg","Ian, I have been saying for five or six quarters or more now that I've mentioned terms and conditions softening. And I have mentioned the insidious nature of that, because there's a lag before you feel the claim effect from that, that impacts both frequency and severity. We see it beginning to show up in claims around the industry. We see claims that wouldn't have been covered by wordings in the past that all of the sudden become claims now because the wordings have been broadened and we can see that in both short tail physical lines and we see it in various casualty-related classes. I think the impact of that is more in front of us, but the notion, when I say soft market, I am not simply at price, I am right on term and condition. Remember, what we do for our living is manage exposure and that's how we think about it. So wording and coverage, that's part of what drives your view of exposure. Then you're putting pricing against that.","Ian Gutterman","Very helpful, thank you, I appreciate it.","Operator","We'll go next to Larry Greenberg, Janney.","Larry Greenberg","Not much left to cover but I'm curious, Evan, with regard to corporate tax reform. If you could talk just specifically, what impact do you think that might have on the industry and, more specifically, whether or not that could really impact insurance demand?","Evan G. Greenberg","Larry, first of all, tell me what tax reform I'm commenting on, because I don't know. So I just say that so that we just keep this in perspective. I cannot...","Larry Greenberg","Yes, I would just say lower tax rates.","Evan G. Greenberg","I understand the general question. I can't respond with specificity, but I'd say this. We are -- we have needed tax reform for so many years, and American business requires tax reform. And if we do major tax reform, i.e. if we move to a territorial system and we lower the rates, even if we lower the rates to 25%, 20%, it's going to have a major stimulus -- and it's done the right way, it can have a major stimulative impact on our economy, not simply the cash that comes home, but the eagerness to invest. And growth, we insure growth and exposure. The faster the economy grows, the better it is for the insurance business, because exposure grows.","Larry Greenberg","Okay, good enough, thank you. ","Operator","Meyer Shields, KBW.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. 0Evan, I want to jump off that recent comment. Are you seeing signs yet of more new business in the U.S. from economic growth?","Evan G. Greenberg","No, not really. I don't -- I think there was a -- animal spirits were obviously awakened by the policy direction of the new administration. Policy direction that I personally endorse when it comes to deregulation of business, less regulation. God, get government out of our way. When it comes to tax reform, when it comes to infrastructure, it will simply have a multiplier impact on our ability to grow efficiently the productivity in the economy. Those are great things. I think that the reality that is setting in is that stating policy and implementing policy are two different things. And it will take time to implement policy. And at the same time, I personally, and I know many were cautious about the stance we're going to take regarding trade because that can have, depending on the stance we take and the approach we take as a country, that can have a negative impact on economic growth. And I think, right now it is always natural. The moment of euphoria is passing. And I think we're at a moment where there is a sense of realism. So therefore, I am not really seeing a pickup in economic activity that -- a trend change that is impacting our business.","Meyer Shields","Okay, thanks. And Phil, quick question, the $73 million accounting adjustment to premiums, did that have any impact on net or operating income in the quarter?","Philip Bancroft","Very little.","Meyer Shields","Thank you very much.","Operator","Ryan Tunis, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ryan Tunis","Hey thanks. So, I just had a follow-up, I guess, just thinking about expenses. And I guess, thematically, and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, Evan, but is it right to think about the integration process' job is. Year one was about making the cost base more efficient and then years two and three perhaps is investing to position the enterprise for future growth? And then I think...","Evan G. Greenberg","No.","Ryan Tunis","That's not the right assessment? Okay. So I'd be interested...","Evan G. Greenberg","No, absolutely not. The expense efficiencies that we're gaining from integration, synergies and all of that, that -- we told you how that plays out between -- we gave you a schedule and showed you how that plays out between 2016, 2017 and 2018. And that is on track or ahead of schedule. What I said to you was, on this call is, that may get -- that we're looking at that right now. We could very well upsize that and we'll talk to you about it in the second quarter. ","So no, it's not like you put it in these neat packets. The investments we're making, we began making them -- ACE was making investments all along and Chubb, in some ways, was starved for investments. And we're making in -- we began and I was very clear about it. And I was clear about it to you on calls, and I was clear about it in the shareholder letter. And that is that we have been making investments and continue to make investments in expanding product, in digitizing the company and in putting in place foundational technologies that will give us greater flexibility to move in many directions, including lower cost. So no, it all goes on at once. That's more how a corporation works.","Ryan Tunis","Okay, understood. So in the letter, the comments about the investments and digitalization was not really referencing an acceleration of investment, just an ongoing part of an investment cycle.","Evan G. Greenberg","Yes, except that, God, a much bigger company now with more opportunities to invest in and, as I said, some who were starved for investment. So we are upsizing investment, but at the same time, given all the efficiencies we gain, we have tremendous flexibility to ameliorate margin pressure, and at the same time, invest for our competitive profile and grow this company in a competitive, sustainable way for the future, which that is our job for shareholders.","Ryan Tunis","Okay, understood. And then just a quick follow-up for Phil. Could you give us an update on the revenue synergies produced as of the end of the quarter? Thanks.","Evan G. Greenberg","The revenue synergies, Phil. Is that 111 million?","Philip Bancroft","Globally.","Evan G. Greenberg","111 million globally in the quarter.","Ryan Tunis","Thank you.","Helen Wilson","Thank you. We have time for one more person to ask question. That comes from Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan.","Sarah DeWitt","Great, thank you. Most of my questions have been answered, but just one follow-up on your comments on Professional Lines inflation. To what extent are you concerned about the potential for inflation with no pricing power? Or do you think the industry could get pricing power if higher inflation emerged?","Evan G. Greenberg","I don't really understand that question, with all due respect. The industry, it's -- we have free will. Lincoln freed us all. And so we have free will and we can react to exposure changes as we see it.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay. So you don't see excess capacity and competitive pressures as preventing pricing power to offset that inflation?","Evan G. Greenberg","Well, those are all factors that -- it's a marketplace. Each will determine for themselves. Ultimately, we all exist in the same world. We're all going to ultimately have the same experience. And some will play it in an intelligent way like a marketplace and some will be a little less intelligent. And I will say, what I am confident about is we have the capacity, we got the paper, we have the balance sheet, we have the data, we have the knowledge, we have the global reach, we have the claims capability and the insight in this business that is unrivaled. And so our ability to manage this business and to be attractive to customers that want Chubb. Well, that's an asset and we'll taken advantage and protect our asset.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Helen Wilson","Thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
