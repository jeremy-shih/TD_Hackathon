Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded.","And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jane Penner, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jane Penner","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.","Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So, please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.","Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google\u2019s future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.","We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.","With that, I will turn the call to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Hello, everybody. We\u2019re going to invite Larry to give us the first round of commentary and then I\u2019ll go through our financials and then Nikesh will have some comment before we turn to Q&A. So here you go, Larry.","Lawrence Page","Thank you, Patrick. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. It\u2019s great to be on the call today and to share our progress since we last spoke six months ago. As you can hear my voice is still hoarse, so I will keep my remarks reasonably short. I am sorry for the scramble earlier today. As our printers have said, they hit send on the release just a bit early.","We had a strong quarter, I am really happy with our business. Revenue was up 45% year-on-year, and at just 14 years old, we cleared our first $14 billion revenue quarter. Not bad for a teenager. Today, we live in a world of abundance; abundant information and abundant computing. Most of us carry at least one device, all the time, every day. In fact many of us would feel naked without our smartphone. It\u2019s hardly surprising mobile search queries and mobile commerce are growing dramatically across the world.","And we use these devices interchangeably, depending on our situation. I switch between my Nexus phone, my Nexus 7 tablet and my new Chromebook that we just announced today many times a day. While this abundance causes disruption, it also creates amazing opportunity. And Google is super well-placed to take advantage of these disruptive opportunities.","Why? Because our search query volumes have grown this quarter as measured year-over-year. And we are seeing tremendous innovation in advertising, which I believe, will help us monetize mobile queries more effectively than desktop today. Indeed, our mobile monetization per query is already a significant fraction compared to desktop. In short, as we transition from one screen to multiscreens, Google has enormous opportunities to innovate and drive ever higher monetization, just like Search in 2000.","Now we took a big bet on Android back in 2005. We believed that aligning standards around an open source operating system would drive innovation across the industry. Most people thought we were nuts. Today, there are over half a billion Android devices, half a billion, with 1.3 million more being activated every day. You should all run out and buy the Nexus 7 tablet for $199. It\u2019s had rave reviews and recently won Gadget of the Year from T3, the gadget experts. You\u2019ll love the integration with Google Play. It is an amazing device.","This time last year, I announced that our run-rate for mobile advertising hit $2.5 billion. That seemed like a pretty big number even for Google. But now we have built up additional mobile revenue from users paying for content and apps in Google Play. Including these new sources grossed up, I can announce our new run-rate for mobile is now over $8 billion. That\u2019s quite a business.","We have so many opportunities today, that unless we prioritize we spread ourselves too thin. Last month, we sunset another 19 products. We\u2019ve now closed or have combined 60 products and features in the last year. And we\u2019ve put a ton of energy into ensuring that our remaining products work really well together. Because as screens multiply, it\u2019s more important than ever that we converge our services.","Users want one consistent, beautiful and simple Google experience. Technology should do all the hard work, liberating users to get on with the important things that matter in their lives and this screen independence is at the core of our strategy.","Take Chrome on Android, for example. We only launched in February, but the experience is already amazing. When you are using Chrome, switching devices is truly painless. All your tabs are there, ready to go. Search on your desktop and the result is right there on your smartphone. You can even click the back button, and it just works. And as more users upgrade to Google+, it\u2019s now over 400 million, users are enjoying amazing experiences across devices like instant photo upload.","In the same way, we want to make advertising super simple for customers. Online advertising has developed in very device specific ways, with separate campaigns for desktop and mobile. This makes arduous work for advertisers and agencies, and means mobile opportunities often get missed.","So we\u2019re working to significantly simplify the campaign experience, working very hard on that. Advertisers should be free to think about their audience, while we do the hard work of dynamically adapting their campaigns across devices. I\u2019m very excited about this.","I talked at the start about the abundance of information. In the early days of Google, you would type in a query, we\u2019d return ten blue links, and you move on fairly happily. Today, you expect more. You expect Google to understand deeply and you expect us to turn your intentions into actions in the blink of an eye.","If you search for Tom Hanks movies, chances are you want movies with Tom Hanks and thanks to our Knowledge Graph that\u2019s what we show now, right from the results page: clean, fast, and organized. And if you\u2019re shopping, say for Ugg boots, we now give you pictures, details about the different boots, prices and information about the local inventory, again right from the results page, clean, fast, and organized. There\u2019s much more we can do to get you the right information at just the right time.","You might have a really important event in the city perhaps a first date, and the traffic is bad. You need to leave early to avoid being late. Or maybe you\u2019ve just landed in a new country and you\u2019re at the airport ATM trying to figure out how much cash to withdraw? Google Now, which we launched on Android in June, gives you all that information and more automatically, with zero effort required on your part.","It\u2019s still early days, but these kinds of tips and recommendations are super powerful. They really save users time and hassle. This is why I\u2019m incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead, given our expertise in Search and Mobile, and our track record monetizing high usage products.","Everyday, I wake up and I\u2019m delighted that our opportunities keep growing. And that we\u2019re birthing to our users great products that are defining the future. It\u2019s a truly exciting time to be at Google.","And now, you will hear from Patrick some details about our quarter.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we are very pleased with the growth trajectory of our business this quarter and this in fact despite significant currency fluctuations in many of our international markets.","So for example, if currencies had remained constant year-over-year, our consolidated revenue growth would actually have been 6% higher. On a positive note, our U.S. growth continues to be strong. And as Larry noted, we\u2019ve got a great quarter on the product front gaining traction in a number of critical areas.","So before I dive into the financials, I just want to give you a bit more detail on the new $8 billion annual mobile run rate that Larry mentioned. The new run rate is different from the one we gave you a year ago. And more specifically, last year, it included only our gross revenue from mobile ads, but this year, in this number we also added the gross revenue from the mobile sales of Google Play content. And finally, it also includes the consumer spending on the Play apps.","So with that and now why don\u2019t I just jump into our financial performance. Our total gross consolidated revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $14.1 billion and that\u2019s also 15% quarter-over-quarter. Google\u2019s Standalone revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $11.5 billion, 5% quarter-over-quarter. In that, our Google Website revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $7.7 billion, 2% quarter-over-quarter, with strengths across most major geographies and verticals.","Our Google Network grew 21% year-over-year to $3.1 billion and 5% quarter-over-quarter. And our other revenue grew 73% year-over-year to $666 million, 52% quarter-over-quarter and this driven by the Nexus 7 sales.","If it were not for these currency fluctuations, Google Standalone revenue would actually have grown 24% year-over-year. As Larry mentioned, Google Standalone business continues to perform very well. A dramatic growth in our new devices is driving mobiles queries and clicks. And although it\u2019s early days, some of our existing ads have better monetization in desktop already today and we\u2019re confident that this transition opens a whole new space for innovation and new format and future monetization.","Turning to MMI, Motorola gross revenue was $2.6 billion. The mobile device division revenue for that period was $1.8 billion and the home division revenue was $797 million, but we\u2019re really pleased with Motorola\u2019s progress in its 150 days.","As indicated in our public filings, our team has made a lot of operational changes, we harmonized and narrowed the product portfolio, there\u2019s been streamlining of software operations and we scale back the markets in which we operate. But that said, we are just at the beginning of the Motorola Google story. And we should expect, as I mentioned before, results from this segment to be quite variable for quite a while yet. Remember that we inherited an entire product pipeline where hardware business cycles are typically in a 12 months to 18 months.","At Google, our aggregate paid click growth was very strong again this quarter up 33% year-over-year, 6% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate CPC or cost-per-click was down 15% and down 3% quarter-over-quarter. But once again please remember that currency headwinds also had a significant negative impact on our CPCs in Q3. In fixed FX terms, aggregate CPC would have been down only 8% almost half of the 15% and down only 1% quarter-over-quarter.","Turning to geographic performance of Google Standalone business, we continue to see robust performance in the U.S., the UK and Japan. On the other hand, we felt the continued impact of the economic situation in continental Europe, but we\u2019ve seen pressure in sectors like travel and retail.","In our earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor Relations website, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve broken down our revenue by U.S., UK and rest of world, to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.","Revenue from the U.S. was up 23% year-over-year to $5.4 billion. The UK was up 16% to $1.2 billion, which includes $6 million of benefit from our hedging program and in FX term; in fact the UK grew 20%. The non-U.S. revenue excluding the UK accounted for 42% of our total revenue or $4.9 billion, up 15% year-over-year, but in fixed terms, in fact was 26%. And all this includes a $56 million benefit from our hedging program.","So let\u2019s come back now to an aggregate level for total consolidated business. Our other cost of revenue was $3.6 billion in Q3 excluding our stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $2.9 billion, which again excludes SBC and the restructuring and related charges recorded in our Motorola business. And our non-GAAP operating profit was therefore $3.8 billion in Q3, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 27%.","For Google Standalone, our traffic acquisition costs were $2.8 billion or 25.5% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.6 billion and that excludes $103 million of stock-based compensation. The increase year-over-year in this other cost of revenue was driven by data center costs, equipment costs and including costs associated with the sales of the Nexus 7, and finally, content acquisition costs.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.2 billion, excluding again SBC of $585 million. And finally, our non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q3 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 34% for Google Standalone. Lastly many of you\u2019ve asked for the depreciation and amortization expense on PPE for standalone Google, which was $465 million for this quarter.","If we flip to Motorola, our total non-GAAP operating expenses including cost of revenue totaled $2.7 billion for the quarter. And keep in mind, that intangible amortization expenses attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola are included in these non-GAAP measures. And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss of Motorola was $151 million for Q3, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 6% for that segment.","Let\u2019s switch over to headcount. For the consolidated business, it decreased by roughly 1,000 in Q3. Standalone Google added about 1,800 people. And remember that historically, we often see some seasonal effects on the hiring in Q3 as folks that we hired in the spring and early summer actually start working in September. In total, the consolidated company ended up the quarter around 53,500 full-time employees.","Our effective tax rate for this quarter was 22% in Q3, the changes from last quarter reflects the mix shift in earnings between the domestic and international subsidiaries and our hedges, but finally, fewer capital gains offsets versus last quarter.","If you allow me to turn to cash management, OI&E or other income and expenses was $62 million, which reflect the continued impact of our FAS 133 expenses of our hedging program, but also fewer capital gains versus last quarter. For more detail on OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.","Operating cash flow was very strong, $4 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $872 million versus last quarter\u2019s $774 million. The majority of our CapEx spent is in \u2013 continues to be related to production equipment and facilities related purchases. All this actually delivers us a free cash flow, which was $3.1 billion with which we\u2019re quite pleased.","The success of our product really gives us the confidence to continue to fund the strategic growth areas, areas that Larry talked about such as Search, YouTube, Android, Chrome, and as always we continue to show our discipline in making the touch calls on products that just don\u2019t live up to our expectations. In Q3, we\u2019ve seen a number of these decisions including the sunset of our Google TV Ad as an example.","So with that, I will hand it off to Nikesh, who will cover more detail on our business performance in the quarter. And after his remarks, we\u2019ll open up the phones for Q&A. Nikesh, here\u2019s to you.","Nikesh Arora","Thank you, Patrick. I\u2019d like to reiterate what Patrick said. Our business had a strong quarter with $11.5 billion in Google Standalone gross revenue. I want to talk to you about our focus and progress on four major trends that are actually helping to drive our business growth.","First, a trend Larry already talked about, the rise of the multiscreen consumer. This is creating huge opportunities for us especially in our advertising business and focus on video and mobile. At the moment, everybody thinks about the online world is divided into desktops and mobile. Larry shared the amazing $8 billion run rate. And I believe in the medium-term, these screens will continue to diverge, but advertising opportunities will converge to allow our marketers to run common campaigns across all these screens.","Our teams have been putting the same focus on mobile and video the last few quarters that we brought to display a few years ago. And it\u2019s rewarding to see it bear fruit. We\u2019ve intensified trading for our sales team across the globe, integrated sales tools, so we can really bring our customers\u2019 mobile video, Search, Display as a cohesive solution. We're also educating our advertisers through initiatives like Go Mobile to ensure they have the right creators and landing pages to make mobile truly work for them.","However, we feel the progress we\u2019ve made is just the very first step in the journey of monetizing many screens Larry talked about. As we develop advertising that can take advantage of the context in which consumers use this many screens, we expect to continue to see better monetization. As we help marketers reach consumers closer to the point of purchase, the opportunities will only get bigger.","We\u2019re already seeing glimpses of this. Take T-Mobile, who use location based mobile ads to drive people nearby into their stores, and in their words, win the last 10 feet. They achieved a click-through rate of about 13%, in what is a very successful strategy. These rates are 3 to 4 times of what you would see without using some of these context. And our Click-to-Call ads work because consumers can respond by contacting an advertiser immediately from the ad, generating approximately 20 million phone calls per month for our clients through our various call products of advertising.","The second trend, which I\u2019m excited about is, it\u2019s not just the context that matters, but also our ability to deliver more precise answers to consumers, something also that Larry talked about. We are working very hard in this. Larry talked Google Now and Knowledge Graph; it\u2019s exciting to see how that even makes opportunities for us happen, as Search become smarter in a commercial environment. We can do a better job of connecting marketers with consumers in the moments that matter, irrespective of what device they are using.","For example, we\u2019re pleased that as of yesterday, Google Shopping completed its transition to a fully paid model based on product listing ads. Now we\u2019re providing product information, pictures, pricing, local inventory information, over billion products from tens of thousands of merchants and over 100,000 sellers. So the new Google Shopping experience, Adorama, one of the US\u2019s largest photo retailers and mail order suppliers saw their click-through rate jump by 176%. Their conversion rate went up by 100% in June as compared to near earlier.","Using the same technology that powers our Knowledge Graph, we\u2019re providing better answers with Google Shopping in other areas where users want to make a purchase. We\u2019re going to reduce the number of steps from search to transaction, making the online experience even more valuable to consumers and marketers.","The third trend, which I\u2019m excited about is that we\u2019re actually making real headway amplifying offline brand campaigns with online media. We have a unique approach that helps advertisers succeed across media. We allow them to use and leverage the attributes of each media and adapt their campaigns for online success. YouTube energized by new professional content and Display are the core of this business helping clients increase awareness, increase capability, and also drive engagement.","In addition, we also continue to make progress in our end-to-end technology platform to help advertisers of all sizes succeed with display advertising. Today, our top partners in the agency world and very large advertisers and publishers, are using a consistent technology stack. The number of impressions that we\u2019ve been able to pass through AdX and Invite platforms have doubled over the last year.","We are also working on creating more video premium inventory without channel strategy in YouTube as more and more viewers move to online video, we expect more and more brands will do the same.","Our brand business is actually creating quite a buzz in the industry because we have great media and our solutions really work. For example, on YouTube, we looked at about 92 different ad campaigns with sales impact, we found that an average spending on YouTube was approximately 2.4 times more efficient than the equivalent television spent.","We have 200 times more video advertisers than the average U.S. television network. In our TrueView format, in which advertisers only pay for ads that users watch has really taken off. We have twice as many advertisers using TrueView since last year. That\u2019s a very important statistic, but like any good brand marketer, the best way for me to show you \u2013 tell you a story is to actually show it. So let\u2019s see what two of our leading brands have done this quarter.","We launched the YouTube Gillette Football Club with Procter & Gamble in Europe, we\u2019ve created global brand platform for Gillette that will reinvent the way people watch football online. The campaigns have generated about $30 million video views. We are working with Coca-Cola on their Vitaminwater branding effort. We\u2019ve partnered to build a strategic music program leveraging YouTube as a platform to anchor, distribute and syndicate the video content. It\u2019s particularly exciting to see that over 100 brands now have over 1 million followers in Google+ including ESPN, PlayStation, Ferrari, H&M, Burberry and Toyota.","Last trend I want to talk about is the trend of cloud computing in the enterprise. Our enterprise business continues to thrive. We saw especially great traction in retail and education sectors this quarter with Dillard's, Kohl's, and Office Depot, all using Google Enterprise products.","In education, there are over 20 million students, faculty and staff, non-Google apps, Princeton, Virginia Tech, and even the Philippines Department of Education which has over 600,000 users.","With the recent launch of Google+ for enterprise customers, organizations of all size \u2013 sizes including capital and Banshee Wines are starting to use our Hangouts and other tools to work together and get things done from anywhere.","In addition to all these trends, our marketing team continues to do an excellent job. We launched a global cross-product initiative to bring the 2012 Olympics to our users worldwide. YouTube streamed the games like to 64 countries. Also YouTube was the efficient live streaming provider with over 1 million hours of live content for the democratic and republic of national conventions. And we passed yet another milestone just this week and YouTube broke it\u2019s own record to reach more than 8 million concurrent live streams of Felix Baumgartner\u2019s recording breaking leap from space with the Red Bull Stratos mission.","So with that as an update, I'm going to hang your back to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Nikesh. So Jennifer, if you would like to tell us the rules we will just get on for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.","Ross A. Sandler \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks guys. Nikesh, one quick question on revenue and Patrick one on expenses. The international and rest of world organic growth was 26% pretty strong, but down from 29% last quarter. So is there any incremental weakness that you saw or was this just mostly from a tougher comp? And then Patrick, your sales and marketing expense was up 18% from last quarter that's a bit higher than the typical increase in 3Q, can you talk about what\u2019s driving up those investments? Thanks guys.","Patrick Pichette","Okay, I\u2019ll start, Nikesh and I are pointing at each other. Yeah, on the marketing expense listen, I think what you see is the impact of the support for the Nexus 7 that we launched in Q3. Otherwise everything was pretty much in line with what we would expect. We just got such a great review of the Nexus 7, we won the support of the market and that's the biggest delta you will see in that number.","In terms of the market, I\u2019ll hand it over to Nikesh for his commentary.","Nikesh Arora","I think it's fair to say that, our revenue growth internationally has been pretty strong. You are seeing some pockets of difference in performance partly because of seasonal reasons and partly because of the continuing economic effects you\u2019re seeing in Europe. So our business is doing better than the economy in most markets in Europe, but it does get impacted a little bit with some of the fluctuations you see there. So from our perspective there is no any cause for concern.","Ross A. Sandler \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Ross. Jennifer, let\u2019s go to the next caller please.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.","Scott W. Devitt \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. Just wondering if you could talk a little more about the strategy behind the decision to monetize product listing ads and then more broadly about the retail strategy for the company? And then secondly, Google website revenue net of distribution tax lowered to 13% from 20% last quarter, I was wondering if possible you could Patrick normalize that for currency to get a better understanding of FX neutral for website growth? Thank you.","Lawrence Page","Hello Scott, this is Larry. On this question about the strategy and product listings, I think we\u2019re just really excited about providing a better experience for our customers. When they search for something I mention boots on the call, now you search for that, I think you'll see a well organized set of product information, ways to buy it and really have a great experience there. And we see, our ability to do that on the ads or monetized product listing side, it\u2019s really helping us provide a better user experience and provide a better advertiser experience. So I\u2019m very excited about that. I think we are still in the early stages of that. We just launched, I think yesterday really and we still got ways to go. So I'll let Nikesh or Patrick take the next question.","Patrick Pichette","On your question relative to our Google site and tech, I\u2019m not \u2013 could you just repeat your question, I not sure, I understood what you meant?","Scott W. Devitt \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I\u2019m just trying to understand better the \u2013 you suggested the 600 basis point effect from currency and I was just wondering if there is a better way to understand the way that currency effected Google site revenue, if I should think of that any differently than the overall currency?","Patrick Pichette","I see, so no, it's even the, I mean we have \u2013 our network is slightly skewed to the US versus our Google site, so you\u2019ll have some mixed effect there because our network is slightly skewed to the US, but overall I think that it still gives you a good sense of proportion as to what's going on in the market. So that\u2019s the way I would kind of think about it from a model point of view.","Lawrence Page","Let me just add \u2013 now it\u2019s on the first part of the question, I think we are really trying to provide answers to people and so, and the strategy for the company really looking at very detailed information and giving you the exact right answer, what we\u2019re doing with knowledge [tides] [ph]. And in search, I wanted to do the same thing as with our advertising to make sure that we get you, as a user in the right answer. And I think that's a very exciting sort of a new strategy for us.","Scott W. Devitt \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks Scott. Jennifer, let's go to the next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Citi.","Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thanks. Two questions please mobile searches are really strong, what\u2019s happening with desktop searches. At some point it's probably reasonable to assume that they\u2019re flat lined, we already reach that. And on the expense side if we just looked at the core Google it looks like the margins are coming down, but if you did roughly $200 million may be in Nexus revenue and if you really sold those devices at cost then margins are actually better than they have been in two year, which is the more accurate interpretation? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Actually, let me start with the margins and then I will answer your first question. On the margins you actually have a couple of effects this quarter, one of them, is clearly as you said the cost of the Nexus that will flow into our other cost of revenue, but also it's the first time that you have the full quarter effect of the amortization of intangibles from the Motorola transaction.","So that is also another big kind levered that actually kicked in. and it should noted just for the financial community that the amortization of intangibles for Motorola flows to both the Google segment and the Motorola segment in different proportion. So again, it\u2019s pretty tough, as I promised you that we\u2019d have a lot of kind of noise in the data, I think that\u2019s a good set of indication. And for the first one, why don\u2019t I let Larry give a few comments on the issue of mobile.","Lawrence Page","So I guess, I feel like you are asking the wrong question a little bit. I think we are really starting to live in the new reality, one where the kind of ubiquity of the screens helps users really move from intent to action much faster and more seamlessly. So I think this will create a huge new universe of opportunities for advertisers where they can focus on platform. Focusing on platform specific queries won\u2019t make us much sense because advertisers will be dynamically adopting across a whole bunch of different devices to reach the right audiences at the right time.","And that\u2019s kind of how we are thinking about it and I alluded to changes that we'll make \u2013 to our ads system to improve the advertiser experience and the user experience around that. And I also think that, we are just seeing tremendous growth in the Android, which really obviously we have tremendous ability to influence and to improve the user experience, to add location, to notify your things as I mentioned around different kinds of non-commercial experiences. We can notify you of commercial experiences as well.","So I think that\u2019s a really big and great opportunity for us. And as I\u2019ve said, that monetization on mobile queries right now is a significant fraction of desktop. So we're kind of living the best of both worlds, we\u2019re able to move our existing ads, our existing monetization over to mobile. And lastly in order to really innovate using Android and our strength of having ads on other mobile platforms and really move advertisers and consumers who into a new world. So  I think we are uniquely positioned to get through the transition and it\u2019s really profit from it. So I am just incredibly excited about that.","Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks for the correction Larry.","Lawrence Page","Thanks. Jennifer let\u2019s got to our next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, two questions, if you run a website with proprietary high quality content today and have to choose a protocol to add, meta data about this content, why would the clear choice would be the Open Graph protocol instead of RDF or one of it\u2019s variables and if that happens and the semantic web arises on the back of open graph doesn\u2019t it place Google at a fundamental disadvantage to achieve the vision that Larry laid out in the beginning of the call. The second question is what do think is the future of vertical search and why is that there are sites that specialize in certain vertical such as travel and local, that seem to do a better job than Google today and if this is going to change over time and what happens with vertical search? Thank you.","Lawrence Page","Yeah, Carlos, I\u2019ll take those questions. I think if you  - I'm not an expert on the protocols you\u2019re talking about, I think in general we made a huge investment in knowledge graph and really understanding in detail about everything. And that\u2019s a major effort for us, and we\u2019d obviously love to have other people help us with that. I think it\u2019s been a little bit of a challenge in the past to get all the labeling aligned and all those things. I think we have a big part to play in that. We\u2019re absolutely very excited about that and I think we\u2019re going to do a lot work in that area. And I think we\u2019re doing well in that space.","Vertical searches, as you asked about, I think our goal has always been to get you to the right place, but we also \u2013 to do that we need to really understand in detail, your context, what you need, what\u2019s really going on with that information, if it\u2019s airline tickets, what are the flights between, what do they cost, products, some one selling we need to know how much they cost to get to know what the shipping is and so on. So I think any place we can get that information accurately, we can present it to our users. However we are very happy to do so.","In general, we found that we knew it\u2019s really, build more of that experience in order to provide a really high quality experience to our users. But again, we\u2019re always open alsoto working with partners.","Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Carlos, for your question. Jennifer, let\u2019s go to our next question.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Ben Schachter \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","One question for Larry and then a couple of housekeeping points on the Apple relationship for Patrick. Larry, there is a lot of this talk about internet use on mobile devices, but switching gears a little, I just wonder if you could talk about the potential for internet access on television screens and how Google might benefit from that? And then Patrick, just two quick housekeeping questions on Apple. One, is 100% of the TAC that you pay, Apple recognized in the Google.com TAC line, and then on iOS 6 there is a seemingly small change in the default search bar right now, says the word search where they used to say Google. How does if at all that change the economic relationship between Apple and Google? Thanks.","Lawrence Page","Okay, so Ben thanks for the question. I mean, obviously we were exited about television, television screens, displays and we have been for a while. We\u2019ve had Google TV, it was a product for quite sometime, I\u2019d just say, I love it and I think it\u2019s a great time to have a real browser, mail on your television, easily access You Tube and all those kind of things.","YouTube is integrated on many, many devices from DVD players and so on to game consoles and things like that. So we obviously are working hard to get distribution for YouTube, for Chrome and for the internet as a whole on television screens, as well as our own products, and we\u2019re very excited about that. I think we are obviously still in the early stages of that, something we really has a great user experience, and we work hard to make that happen.","Patrick Pichette","On the \u2013 sorry, just want to talk about the TAC line and just to say that, yes, I mean obviously all the TAC that we paid to Apple, it is just another partner for distribution, so it all is tied to our \u2013 the TAC line that we have for Google.com. On your question of the default, I mean although there is \u2013 nothing is changed, right, I mean, when you use Google, we are a great partner with Apple, we\u2019re a great partner with many of them, and in doing so, when you do search, I mean we have a great, we have the \u2013 the fact that they\u2019ve changed from Google to search is still kind of run by our engines. So I hope that clarifies the point Ben.","Ben Schachter \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Okay, thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Ben. Jennifer let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","Next question come from Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.","Anthony Diclemente \u2013 Barclays","Hi, thanks. I started to harp on the CPC question, but you mentioned them being down 8% XFS. Can you just Patrick, talk a little bit about the other drivers, I think everybody assumes that the bulk of the down 8% is mobile, but I know there are other factors driving that down 8%, so if you could just kind of give us order of magnitude in emerging markets and so forth if possible?","And then secondly, on allocation of your sizable free cash flow and on your cash balance Patrick in the past you\u2019ve talked about reviewing and considering capital returns at the Board level. And at the same time you\u2019ve talked about your cash balance being a strategic asset for Google, just wondering if you could give us an update on yours, on Larry\u2019s, Board\u2019s thinking on allocation of capital and use of your cash balance? Thanks for the question.","Patrick Pichette","Yeah, listen, on the CPC trends nothing has changed from last two quarters. And in fact, I think people have a tendency just to harp and assuming that it\u2019s automatically mobile\u2026","Anthony Diclemente \u2013 Barclays","Right.","Patrick Pichette","And if you look through our results, I just kind of point to a few areas, if you look at our mix between our Google properties and our network, right, our network grew quite a bit again this quarter and that would drive a lot of pack as well. So I and again that\u2019s the reason why I kind of want to educate and tell and remind everybody that just all of these mix effects whether it would be mobile versus laptop versus desktop, but also emerging market versus developed markets and also our Google.com versus network.","And then we haven\u2019t even talked about the changes in our ads quality, which actually can change quite a bit as well. So I think that matters a lot, and I think that it\u2019s really important now we understand that all these mix effects are actually playing or play there in the CPC. So and that\u2019s what we don\u2019t give, if we start giving down all the breakdown right, it\u2019s just endless.","So for us, the real issue for us is, but what really matters is, they are going down, but on the flip side of that, right, given all these mix issues, what we really see is our pay clicks going up at a pretty healthy rate at 33% again this quarter, which actually gives you a sense of people who are engaged, people are using our products, it\u2019s really about this transformation of multi-devices and in fact that there is a little bit less CPC is not a concern compared to all the offside that we see on the other side.","On the issue of our cash and capital balance, I think, you get the same answer and maybe Larry wants to kind of chime in if he wishes to, but we just review this on a constant basis. We ask ourselves the question, is there real options for us actually to use the cash from a strategic perspective and we\u2019ve come to the conclusion that it is a real strategic asset for us right now with the ability to balance. And so we think it\u2019s prudent to actually manage our capital structure to where it is as we speak.","Lawrence Page","We have nothing to announce at this time.","Anthony Diclemente \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Thank you very much.","Lawrence Page","Thank you. Thanks, Anthony.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Anthony.","Lawrence Page","Can we have the next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you for the question. I have two for Patrick and then one for Larry. Patrick, I\u2019ll start out with yours first. Can you give us an idea of the run rate that you are talking about, the $8 billion for mobile, can you give us an idea of what that is on a kind of same-store sales basis, you gave us the $2.5 billion run rate last year, what is the mobile advertising piece, I think that\u2019s something people are really interested in, so extra stuff from Google Play? The follow-up question I had for you was, what\u2019s the margin profile on the Google Play content revenue that you\u2019re recognizing? And then the question for Larry is, I guess just in listening to Mark Mahaney\u2019s question, I was wondering in this new reality you mentioned in response to his question, how does Google Fiber play into this vision to have your content and search capabilities go across multiple screens? Thank you.","Lawrence Page","Okay, I\u2019ll let Patrick, take the first part.","Patrick Pichette","Okay. So on the $8 billion, so let me give you just a bit more information on it, but clearly we don\u2019t breakdown each of the categories, we just wanted to kind of give you a sense of proportion. A point that\u2019s important is, of the three categories I gave you, ads continues to be the bulk of it, the vast majority of it. And then on the case of the Google Play, it\u2019s important to note from a modeling perspective that everything\u2019s that\u2019s content, that is whether a book, a movie content is actually booked on our books on a gross basis.","Everything that is tied to apps is booked on a net basis, but it\u2019s still a huge kind of number in all cases. So without giving you, I just want to give you that, so that you don\u2019t start thinking that there is actually 8 billion that is book to revenue in our result that you see, but in fact, two of the three are there, the third one is done on a net basis, just because of our accounting rules. So and the vast majority is still ads.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And can you just give us a sense of the margin profile on the not ad piece?","Patrick Pichette","We don\u2019t provide that. We don\u2019t give any of the details of that. But clearly, it\u2019s a different profile, because it\u2019s content, so we have partnerships that we deal with.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great.","Patrick Pichette","On the case of, why don\u2019t I turn it over to Larry to talk about Google Fiber and Google TV.","Lawrence Page","Hi, Heather, it\u2019s a great question. I think, Google Fiber I think we are in the early stages, right, it\u2019s just rolling in out in one city or two cities that are one city. And we\u2019re really excited about it and I\u2019m excited about the user experience there. In fact, I think I\u2019m about to go, went soon from my asked trials. But you control it with a Nexus 7 tablet actually, that\u2019s the remote for it. I think it will be an amazing experience from a user standpoint, one that can really drive that industry forward. So are quite excited about that like said we are in the early stages, obviously rolling that up.","Patrick Pichette","It\u2019s worth just to close on that. It\u2019s worth kind of noting also that we are pushing for the next chapter of the internet in the U.S. with Google Fiber. People, there is such a demand for higher speed access at reasonable prices, I think that we got a great mouth trap with Google Fiber and we hope it excites everybody and promote the environment that will actually give us that kind of connectivity in the U.S. and elsewhere as well.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks. Jennifer, let\u2019s go to a next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan","Douglas T. Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Just want to ask two questions. First is just following up on Scott\u2019s earlier question, we saw a deceleration in Google Properties and then an acceleration on network side. But hoping that you could talk about a little bit beyond the U.S. and the international mix, is there anything else that you would attribute those dynamics to. And then secondly, you talked a lot about multiple screens and ambiguity of devices, how concerned are you that in a mobile world, behavior is different and we\u2019re living in more of an apps-based environment and Google might not be that starting point for people on mobile devices. Thanks.","Lawrence Page","Yeah, thanks. That was a great question, Doug, I\u2019ll take the second one first. I think a lots been made on that note, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really true, kind of apps versus search. We obviously have a great position in apps, we have the Android Play Star, which has a huge number of apps. And I think that those experiences are good experiences and there are some things that are better than them, but to us some things that are better than the web of the apps. I think over time, we do our jobs right, you have the same capabilities in both places, and we have such ability in apps, you built some more usually good apps, the same way you go to webpage and so on. So I think anyway I think those differences will emerge or where it is tenures over time. I think we obliviously have a strong position in both.","So I\u2019m not so worried about that. I think that there is obviously innovation that goes out of mobile and we talked a little bit about all the different context and location you could have on mobile, the fact they\u2019re always carrying a device with you and those things are very powerful. So you want all that when you are on desktop seller on the web, you want that same information. And so we wanted a seamless experience that goes across both mobile and desktop and TV or whatever screens you have, and that\u2019s what we are building. I think that we are going to see tremendous in these things.","The other point I make is that, there is a small, relatively small number of people right now that have Chrome on their mobile devices. And I find Chrome on my mobile device like the same is having a desktop computer a year ago or something. And it\u2019s an amazing experience. You can buy things. It remembers your credit card numbers and that means it\u2019s a very, very easy great experience. That\u2019s been, that\u2019s rolled up to a relatively small number of people, but it will be increasing quickly.","So I guess just seeing all those trends, I think it\u2019s tremendous opportunity for us. And I don\u2019t think people are really thinking about it correctly now. So Patrick, do you want the cover the detailed question?","Patrick Pichette","Yeah, with pleasure. Look just to reiterate that our Google website\u2019s revenue was up and with strength across most geographies and most verticals. I mean obviously you\u2019ve heard Nikesh talk about, Douglas, we can\u2019t control the economy in the short term, so if there is a country that is slowing down a little bit then we clearly kind of see it in the result as well because Google is actually a pretty good protector of the present as far the economists are varying kind of reminds us. But then on the Google Network, I think we\u2019re just really pleased with, it\u2019s skewed slightly more to the U.S. but really pleased with the performance overall with all of our networks, that\u2019s been performing well. So nothing additional to kind of highlight apart from just a good general trends.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Jennifer, our next question please?","Operator","Next question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete.","Richard Kramer \u2013 Arete Research Services LLP","Hi, thanks very much. I\u2019ve got some, one question for each of you, if I may, for Larry if you could just expand a little bit more on YouTube and maybe provide not only some metrics, but really your may be three to five year vision of its rolling video distribution between Google TV and the fiber project and some of the other options. For Nikesh, could you talk a little bit about emerging markets and where Android really is the dominant not only in scale, mobile computing platforms, and what may drive that to show faster international growth, if its having sales force or purchasing power or something else and maybe Patrick, could you help us understand a little bit the FX headwind on the top line how it might have been expressed moving down the P&L especially in sort of net profit terms. Thanks very much.","Lawrence Page","Richard, that\u2019s a great question on YouTube. I haven\u2019t had, Nikesh mentioned Google TV for a while, I think recently kind of YouTube transition from maybe a year ago, to be really something that keeps me entertained for hours on the TV. It can play back, lots of really high quality, highly exciting things, they are now kind of tailored for me, my channels and so on and I think we have tremendously increasing YouTube usage, continues to grow like crazy. And we\u2019ve head increasing monetization as well which causes people to put more content on it, and to monetize it worldwide, kind of in a blink of an eye you can put things up.","So I was just, the recent video of horse dancing, came in style. I have been watching, its 400 million views now \u2013 500 million. And that kind of thing to really just put the switch, turn it on, get a worldwide distribution and sort of \u2013 almost without doing any work, if you are a provider of this content is an amazing thing. And I think that\u2019s how we see the future, we\u2019re just kind of continue to grow that. It is going to be available everywhere on your mobile, on your TV, on your desktop wherever you want. It\u2019s going to keep track of the kinds of things you\u2019re interested in and really provides you an amazing experience, and provide a great experience for the advertisers, true view is exploding, which gives us high quality ads from an end user standpoint, because they can skip some if they want. So it encourages paths that are actually entertaining, not annoying, and that\u2019s been working or making money over that and it\u2019s coming like crazy as well. So I couldn\u2019t be more excited about all that.","Nikesh Arora","Thanks Richard. As far as the emerging markets in Android, I mean I think we\u2019re very excited about the fact that Android is becoming very successful platform in many markets, outside the U.S. not just the U.S. I think in terms of what drive, I am not sure if your question is about faster growth of Android or faster growth of monetization on Android platforms. I think on both of them, we\u2019re seeing the adoption in various markets, there OEMS are producing Android devices on the bleeding edge and doing a phenomenal job of working with operators in those market and distributing them, so we think that will continue because and Android is providing to be a great platform for innovation for all the OEM.","In addition to that as more and more people use mobile device, I think we\u2019ve talked a lot in this call about have those mobile devices are being used, we are seeing an increasing in query growth and we are seeing our various new ad formats and ads where we bring context into account is actually helping us monetize. So I think both those trends are going in the right direction. Hopefully that provides more opportunity for us.","Patrick Pichette","Let me close on FX, so Richard, just two points, one is, it\u2019s been interesting in Q3, the U.S. dollar has really weakened versus a whole host of currencies, so typically you have one currency that goes down another one is more stable, we\u2019ve really seen it across-the-board, it just happens with the macro economic trend, again, it\u2019s something you can\u2019t predict. So it\u2019s been across-the-board and without giving you the details of how it flows to margins, it is fair to say and we\u2019ve already talked in the past that our operating expenses are skewed to the U.S. I mean Mountain View is the headquarter and so from that perspective it has some effect as well. So I think you can navigate through this. So it was definitely a significant impact for this quarter.","Anthony Diclemente \u2013 Barclays","Okay. Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Richard. Jennifer, let\u2019s go to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Patrick Pichette","Justin, are you with us?","Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Can you hear me now?","Patrick Pichette","We can.","Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","On a high level, I just want to know, if searches on mobile the same quality in your estimate as PC I mean are you still getting good high CPC travel and e-commerce searches on mobile? Second, maybe you could talk a little bit about the rollout of Google product search seeing those ads definitely in core search results and could that have an impact in Q4?","And then maybe some detail on the hedging program, this is one of your worst year-over-year hedging, I\u2019m sorry, one of your worst year-over-year FX impacts down $500 million and now you get a $62 million benefit and I think you disclosed the cost was 124. I guess there is there something you can do to kind of improve that the ratio is there and not spend so much and a get a better benefit win FX is negative thanks.","Lawrence Page","Yes, Justin thanks for the question. I don\u2019t know the details of the particular queries on the Google Desktop, but I can tell you I think like for example in Travel we bought IT software for a sizable amount, we thought it was important to provide a better experience there, when you type cities and you want an airline ticket, you actually need that detailed information, and I think I\u2019m not worried about any of that to the extend we provide great an amazing user experience for people. However they are looking for all types of different kinds of information as long as we\u2019re providing again that very detailed, very organized customer results of people, I think that translates across all of your screen is just fine. Nikesh or Patrick, do you want to?","Patrick Pichette","Again jumping on to the FX issue if you don\u2019t mind, look I think that it\u2019s interesting your question Justin, but let\u2019s remind ourselves of a couple of points, because I think our FX program has actually delivered amazing value to shareholders. One is, we don\u2019t hedge revenue, we hedge profits. And we hedge a number of kind of major currencies like the Euro, the Pound, the Canadian Dollar, few others which is the core of our program, and not only but actually our hedge program is certainly designed for long-term kind of 18 months as a risk reduction strategy and doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate in a way we should perform for three months kind of timeframe in our financial results. And it\u2019s really also build to make sure, I guess you had a cost benefit ratio, thereof making sure that it\u2019s set for bit dislocations.","So if it\u2019s just a smaller variance in the short-term, you are not going to get us much benefit as it is a big dislocation. So for all these reasons and then what I mentioned a bit earlier, which is we\u2019ve seen actually FX across a whole slue of currencies this quarter, which these smaller currencies just added up and we don\u2019t hedge for them today. That\u2019s what kind of ended up in the puzzle. So we are constantly looking at our forecast and if it makes sense we will actually throw in new currencies going forward. So that\u2019s been the story on FX, but I wouldn\u2019t read in anyway (inaudible) performed that it hasn\u2019t performed well, it\u2019s performed very low. So why don\u2019t I turn it back over to Nikesh for the last question.","Nikesh Arora","Yeah, in terms of the product listing ad as we talked about, we\u2019re really excited that we actually went on a full rollout for product listing ads and as we\u2019ve said we have 1 billion products that are in there. So as we\u2019ve also, as Larry talked about getting more precise information. We believe that users when they search they come exploring on the web, when they have a better idea, what they are trying to buy. They start expressing intent by being more precise of what they ask for.","And we believe being able to do product listing ads gets us closer to intent because if somebody types a Nikon D800 then we know they are looking to buy or looking to get more information about a specific product and the fact that we can show them reviews pictures and pricing information gets us closer to action. And we believe in the medium term that\u2019s going to create more monetization and a better monetization for us as opposed to having just 10 blue links of ads we\u2019d send them to other websites. So I think that\u2019s going to have a good impact in the medium term, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to comment whether that has an impact in Q4 or not.","Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Justin, for your question. We will go for one last question. Jennifer, please?","Operator","We will take our last question from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian Pitz \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Great. Thanks. Larry, bigger picture question on your mobile comments, would you give us some rough sense of how long it could take to close the bulk of the gap between desktop and mobile monetization, is this a matter of quarters or years that will see that come together. And then maybe just you made a quick comment on travel weakness last quarter, I think you said travel was strong across the board. And then you came back today and said it sounds like that was a weaker category, just anymore color on the weakness of travel? Thanks.","Lawrence Page","Thanks Brian for the question. And we have kind of policy of not talking about the future, so I think it\u2019s generally a good policy. I tend to be very impatient and I think, I kind of reiterate what I said that we are positioned well, very, very well, and uniquely well, because we have hardly very significant fraction to monetization on mobile and that\u2019s a great start. And we\u2019re working on changes, we do things we\u2019ve been investing in this space for long, long time right, our mobile monetization is not zero, it\u2019s a very significant number.","As we try to end also with $8 billion number. And I think that it\u2019s kind of good pace there and I don\u2019t think that the things we need to do are that huge, to have us in a very good spot and I think we have opportunity to be higher monetization than where we are now. Put some innovation which we\u2019re kind of doing, it looks like that I\u2019m very impatient and I think that, another point I make I guess that I\u2019ve made already, I think that, advertisers are ads still requires they spend some metric to deal with mobile in general.","I think advertisers, mobile until very recently it\u2019s been relatively small percentage of advertising spend from those advertisers. I think that\u2019s starting to be in the long as the case, right, and that\u2019s happening relatively quickly, and I think advertisers will also react to that, and you will see them invest, more efforts in targeting those users, running apps for them in phone which holds obviously benefit our monetization there. Actually we have a lot of trends working for us, so I am not worried about this in terms of our business at all. I think it\u2019s more of an opportunity for us because we\u2019re better positioned than most other companies. I guess (inaudible) estimate, short-term impact and I am quite impatient.","Patrick Pichette","If I can just close on just travel, I mean obviously there\u2019s a couple of factors in there, one of them is clearly \u2013 there is seasonality in travel, so obviously that\u2019s always an impact quarter-over-quarter, and then as we \u2013 the same news you read about Europe or other parts of the world that are in different economic situations. You will notice that if you kind of track Google Trends and you go and mine into the data, you will see that some sectors are performing better, others are not, and as I mentioned in my commentary, at the very beginning, travel and retail has been somewhat weak in Europe just given their situation, so no real surprises there Brian. Thank you for you questions.","Just before we close, I just want to take a ten seconds on behalf of Nikesh, Larry and myself thanking in the amazing work of our Googlers, all our employees, all our partners, what an amazing last 90 days it\u2019s been both at Motorola and Google.","And I\u2019ll let Larry close with the last words before we turn it over to Jennifer to close the call.","Lawrence Page","Yeah, I just want to thank all of you after spending so much time with us and following us and doing your analysis. And with that, I\u2019ll close the call.","Patrick Pichette","Jennifer, we\u2019ll let you close the call.","Operator","All right, thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s presentation, thank you for your participation."],"1489":["Alphabet, Inc.

First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen West","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's First Quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor.","Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, and they are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.","During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. ","As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz\/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today.","And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you, Ellen. We delivered ongoing strong revenue growth, up 26% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency. The sustained outstanding performance in sites revenues, in particular, reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth, with mobile search again leading the way. Robust growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. Ongoing substantial growth in other revenues, namely cloud, hardware and Play, continues to highlight the growing contribution of our non-ads opportunities. ","Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. As we highlighted in our earnings press release, our results this quarter were affected by a new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. I'll highlight the impact on particular line items as I review the quarter. I will then conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions. ","Starting with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $31.1 billion were up 26% year-over-year. We realized the positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $1.3 billion or $1.1 billion after the impact of our hedging program. ","Turning to Alphabet's revenue by geography. You can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $14.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.5 billion, up 29% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 21%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $4.8 billion, up 33% versus last year and up 30% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Australian dollar. Other America revenues were $1.7 billion, up 36% year-over-year and up 35% in constant currency. ","On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.5 billion, up 37% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.2 billion, up 39% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were, first, costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which was affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses primarily from G&A; second, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube; and finally, hardware related costs. ","Operating expenses were $10.7 billion, up 27% year-over-year, with the biggest increase in R&D expenses reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects advertising investments in cloud and hardware as well as the Assistant. ","G&A expense trends were affected this quarter by a number of factors, in particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of revenues and the benefit of the Uber litigation settlement. ","Stock-based compensation totaled $2.5 billion. The quarter-on-quarter step-up reflects the full year equity refresh grant to employees at the beginning of the quarter and the biannual grant to SVPs. ","Headcount at the end of the quarter was 85,050, up 4,940 people from last quarter, including just over 2,000 people who joined at the end of January when we closed our previously announced deal with HTC. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were the additions from HTC followed by hiring and cloud for both technical and sales roles. ","Operating income was $7 billion, up 7% versus last year, and the operating margin was 22%. Other income and expense was $3.5 billion, which includes $3 billion of primarily unrealized gains in equity security investments recognized under the new accounting standard. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. ","Our effective tax rate was 11% for the first quarter. As outlined in our earnings press release, this includes a 5 percentage point reduction from the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which offset the income tax expense on the equity security gains. ","Net income was $9.4 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $13.33. As indicated in the table in our earnings press release, these results reflect an increase in net income of $2.4 billion and $3.40 in earnings per diluted share due to the impact from the gains in equity security investments we've already discussed. ","Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $7.3 billion, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $11.6 billion with free cash flow of $4.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $103 billion. ","Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $31 billion, up 26% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year, led again by mobile search complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube. ","Network revenues were $4.6 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $4.4 billion, up 36% year-over-year fueled by cloud, hardware and Play. As a reminder, the hardware revenues in this line now include our Nest business, and prior periods were restated. ","We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. As we previously announced, we made a change this quarter to impression-based monetization metrics for our network business given the ongoing growth of programmatic. ","Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.3 billion or 24% of total advertising revenues and up 36% year-over-year. This year-on-year increase in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year, reflecting primarily an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. The underlying trend affecting the network TAC rate year-over-year continues to be the shift to programmatic, which carries higher TAC. ","Google's stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 22% year-over-year. Operating income was $8.4 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 27%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $7.7 billion, reflecting investments in facilities, production equipment and data center construction. Facilities was the largest component of CapEx of this quarter due primarily to the $2.4 billion purchase of Chelsea Market that we announced in March. ","Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $150 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. As a reminder, Nest results are now reported as part of the Google segment, with revenues reflected in the Google other revenues line. Operating loss was $571 million for the first quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $55 million. ","We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. At Waymo, we have achieved 5 million miles of driving on city streets, adding the latest million in just 3 months. We also announced a long-term partnership with Jaguar Land Rover for their fully electric I-PACE vehicles. Verily is seeing good progress with Onduo, its joint venture with Sanofi. The companies made its diabetes management platform commercially available in 3 states with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arkansas and South Carolina and Anthem's health plan in Georgia. ","Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. The opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary, and we remain focused on investment to support long-term revenue and profit growth. We have both the business confidence to invest appropriately in the next phase of innovation as well as clarity about some very compelling opportunities that, in our judgment, will enable us to create shareholder value. We're pleased with the continued momentum of our revenue growth again this quarter, reflecting strong underlying trends across our business, which are amplified by our relentless focus on innovation, not only in our newer businesses, like cloud and hardware, but in our sites business. Specifically, we're excited by the still sizable opportunity in search advertising led by mobile. At 26% year-on-year revenue growth in our sites business, we continue to benefit from our investments to enhance the user and advertiser experience. ","Second, with respect to profitability. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenues, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we continue to anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC, as a percentage of sites revenues, will slow beginning in this second quarter. ","Within OpEx, as I said last quarter, we are continuing to support our priority investment areas. Within R&D, this is reflected in increased headcount, particularly for technical roles. Sales and marketing is similarly elevated to support these areas, both in the quarter and for the full year, and we expect expenses to remain more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the holiday season. ","As you've seen in prior quarters, G&A can be a more difficult line to forecast. In particular, this quarter, we had the impact of the accrual for performance fees related to the equity gains previously discussed, partially offset by the reallocation of some expenses to other cost of revenues and the Uber legal settlement. We appreciate the importance of prioritization and are keenly focused on the steps we can take to make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns. ","For our Other Bets, we remain focused on moving toward commercial applications in a number of areas with a continued focus on calibrating investment to metrics for success. ","Third, with respect to CapEx. Our commitment to growth is evident in the trend in CapEx investment, almost equally split this quarter between compute capacity and facilities. Our facilities spent in Google dominated by the Chelsea Market acquisition reflects that we favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities. With respect to compute capacity, the largest component of CapEx is for machines that incorporate the latest technologies. We are also investing in data center growth and increased network capacity through undersea cables. These combined investments will expand our compute capacity to support our growth outlook across Google, including machine learning, the Assistant and cloud. ","In many respects, these investments underscore my opening comment about both our confidence and clarity about future opportunities with our focus on proprietary solutions that enable us to deliver the secure, reliable, high-performing compute infrastructure to support new and emerging products and services for our users, advertisers and enterprise customers. ","I will now turn the call over to Sundar.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Ruth. The end of Q1 is always an exciting time as we prepare for our annual developer conference, Google I\/O. Computing is evolving at a rapid rate, and we can't wait to share what's next and how we are tackling important issues. I want to call out an important highlight from Q1, the Google news initiative that we unveiled in March. Over the years, we have worked closely with the news industry to address key challenges through projects like Accelerated Mobile Pages. We are building on that partnership with the $300 million investment to elevate and strengthen quality journalism. As part of this effort, we announced more than a dozen new products, including Subscribe with Google developed in close collaboration with publishers, which lets you use your Google account to buy a subscription on participating news sites. We've had overwhelming interest. ","Since the launch, we have heard from more than 300 news publishers who are interested in Subscribe with Google. We also introduced new tools for journalists and improvements to our platforms to ensure that we are surfacing accurate quality content where it matters most. ","Today, I'll quickly talk about how machine learning is helping us advance that mission, then I'll highlight progress in our 3 big areas, cloud, YouTube and hardware, and share updates on our computing and advertising platforms. ","First, machine learning and making information accessible to everyone. Our own ML-powered products like Google Photos and Google Lens gets better every day. The Google Assistant is a great example of this. In the home, we have added over 200 new device partners that work with Assistant just on the last 4 months alone. We now partner with all major manufacturers of connected devices for the home in the U.S. ","All told, the Google Assistant can now help you with over 1 million actions, including new things like reminding you to buy bread when you get to the store or sending money to friends or if you want to get a ride share home. For a concept we unveiled at I\/O less than 2 years ago, this is great progress. ","AI is also unlocking new opportunities for everyone. Just in the last few months, we have seen some amazing applications from dairy farmers in Georgia using TensorFlow to improve the health their herds to our own Google researchers who figured out how to use ML techniques to assess a person's risk of a heart attack. The possibilities of AI in health care are truly exciting. ","At our recent TensorFlow summit, we introduced TensorFlow hub, making it easier for developers to share and reuse models so that we can work together to tackle even more problems and get to better ideas faster. Our investments in this area are helped because of our specialized Tensor Processing Units, which are specifically designed to be highly efficient for machine learning applications. ","Of course, we continue to advance Google's core mission in other ways, too. We recently launched our Google Go app in 26 African countries. This app reduces the amount of data needed to display search results by 40%, and we continue to invest in ways to give people granular and easy controls over their information across all our products. Every single day, nearly 20 million people visit My Account, which gives them options to review their Google security, privacy and ad settings. Additionally, tools like security checkup and privacy checkup prompt people to keep their account secure and control their data settings. ","Now turning to our three big areas, cloud, YouTube and hardware. Last quarter, we shared some exciting metrics about the progress of Google Cloud, including that we passed $1 billion per quarter in 2017. In Q1, we saw increasing momentum. We are growing across the board and are also signing significantly larger, more strategic deals for cloud. Our security capabilities, the easy-to-use advanced data analytics and machine learning solutions and the secure and industry-leading collaboration platform, G Suite, are winning customers over. Google Cloud is growing well. Some examples of new technologies announced in the quarter include Cloud AutoML, which makes it easier for companies without machine learning expertise to build complex neural nets and more than 20 new security products. ","Our global infrastructure continues to expand to support demand. We commissioned 3 new subsea cables and announced new regions in Canada, Japan, Netherlands and Saudi Arabia, bringing our total of recently launched and upcoming regions to 20. ","G Suite has reached a point where it can serve all the needs of a large enterprise, and as a result, grow at a certain inflection point. The Suite is growing from strength to strength. We believe our secure environment is an important factor in driving enterprise customer wins. G Suite customers like Colgate-Palmolive Company tell us that no one offers a better combination of hardware, network and data security. In Q1, we also signed agreements with customers like Airbus and Thailand's Krung Thai Bank. As a result, G Suite revenue growth accelerated in Q1. ","Next, YouTube. The platform continues to grow as millions of creators build communities and find opportunity on YouTube. Over the last year, channels earnings 6 figures annually grew more than 40%. This quarter, Dua Lipa's video for New Rules became the 100th video on YouTube to reach 1 billion views. We are also investing in new experiences like life content, where we see tremendous momentum. One recent example was our exclusive Coachella live stream, which had more than 41 million live views from all over the world. ","Coachella was YouTube's most viewed live music festival ever. And no surprise, Beyonc\u00e9 was the most viewed Coachella performance ever on YouTube. Even as we invest in new experiences, we stay very focused on making sure that YouTube remains a safe platform with great content. We are aggressively combating content that violates our strict policies through a combination of user and machine flags. Over 6 million videos removed in Q4 were first flagged by our machine systems, and over 75% of those videos were removed before receiving a single view. We also changed our monetization requirements to better identify creators who contribute positively to the community and drive more ad revenue to them. ","Moving to hardware. This quarter, we welcome Nest of the Google hardware team to supercharge our efforts. Nest is building industry-leading products for the home, including new additions like the Nest Hello doorbell and Nest temperature sensor. In 2017, they sold more devices than the previous 2 years combined. They are an incredibly talented team with fantastic momentum. ","Google Home continues to be super popular, and we are making it available in many more countries. Just recently, we launched Google Home in many -- in India and Singapore, and the response has been terrific. ","Our early 2018 Net Promoter Scores rank among the highest in the industry across all product categories. This shows how much love people have for Made by Google consumer hardware devices and makes us even more excited for what's ahead. ","There's great momentum across our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome. At Mobile World Congress, a new generation of Android partner devices was introduced, including Android One phones like the Nokia 7 plus. Android One pairs high-quality hardware with a secured and streamlined software and experience from Google. This quarter, we launched the Acer Chromebook Tab 10, the first Chrome OS tablet designed specifically for education. It is a secure and easily shareable tablet equipped with all the Chromebook features that educators and students love. ","And finally, our advertising platforms. We continue to make Google Search and Shopping the best places for people to find and buy products from a range of merchants. We recently announced shopping actions, allowing customers to easily buy from their choice of participating retailers on the Google Assistant and Search with the universal card across mobile, desktop and even Google Home. The results are really helping retailers. Early testing showed that participating retailers see an average increase in basket size of about 30%. ","YouTube is delivering great results for our advertisers. To help brands reach broad audiences on YouTube with even more flexibility, we introduced TrueView for Reach, which optimizes in stream ads to reach a wide audience. In beta testing, 9 out of 10 campaigns drove a significant lift in ad recall, with an average lift of nearly 20%. ","We are also helping small businesses take advantage of video with the expansion of YouTube Director onsite to over 170 U.S. cities. This gives SMBs access to a professional filmmaker to create and edit their video ads. ","Finally, we remain focused on investing in our publisher partners. Last year, we paid $12.6 billion to publishing partners in our ad network. We recently announced AdSense Auto ads. This uses machine learning to analyze ad placements on a publisher's page and show ads when they are likely to perform well while providing a good user experience. ","Google's success depends not just on the success of our partners but also on the community's very work. We recently announced the Rolling Study Halls program for rural areas across 12 states. It equips school buses with Wi-Fi devices and onboard educators so that students with long commutes can get their homework done during the trip. ","We are also making long-term investments in our offices and data centers around the country. Last month, we announced the purchase of Manhattan's Chelsea Market building. And in Tennessee and Alabama, we broke ground on 2 new data centers, which will have a big economic impact on the local economies. These investments are made hand-in-hand with our commitment to sustainability. ","In 2017, we officially met our goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all electricity consumed by our operations around the world. ","I want to close by saying thank you to our employees. It's been a particularly tough few weeks for the Google family, especially at YouTube. I'm so proud of the resilience that our employees have shown, and I'm so grateful for the support we have gotten across the industry and from the community. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth","Ruth, just first on the accounting change, I was just hoping you could clarify. If we're trying to normalize that, is it right that we would be adding back about $632 million to operating income and then reducing EPS by $3.40, and then just on the EPS side, perhaps adjusting for the tax rate? And then just in terms of the business, I just wanted to ask about Waymo. If you could talk a little bit about just the latest timing for the commercial launch in Phoenix and how quickly you'd look to expand to other markets, and then just how you're thinking about the technology and whether you'll license it to others going forward or keep it more proprietary for Waymo services?","Ruth Porat","Sure. So on the accounting standard, we try to lay out all the component parts clearly on the cover of the earnings release so that you would have it all in one place. I think you summarized it right, but I'll just direct everybody to the earnings release. The net of which was the gain from the equity investments was $2.4 billion to net income. That is net of performance fees as well as the release of a deferred tax asset that we have, so it does reflect $3 billion in gains. And I think you know this, but this quarter, the accounting standard requires marks for everything where there is an observable raise.","So these are unrealized -- the majority of them are unrealized, not actually monetized by Alphabet, and then the performance fees are calculated based on investment returns. They're accrued but not paid until an exit event occurs, and they do appear in OpEx. And as you noted, there is also, therefore, the benefit that flows through on the tax line, and that is 5 percentage points of benefit offset to the effective tax rate for the quarter. As it relates to your Waymo question, there was a lot in there. We do remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts. It is still very early. In terms of our progress, this year is about offering a service that is safe, that works, that delight users in the Phoenix area. The rider program in Phoenix is open to members of the public, and riders will use a Waymo app to hail one of our fully self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel, and will pay for the service. We've also had progress on the vehicle partnerships, as I mentioned in my opening comments. Last month, Waymo announced it signed a long-term strategic partnership with Jaguar beginning with a collaboration to design and manufacture self-driving I-PACE vehicles for Waymo's transportation service. These are all electric cars.","This new partnership in the vehicles adds to our strong position with FCA, and the production of the cars begins in 2020. And then we are expanding our testing to more states. We're also working on additional areas like applying the technology to logistics and deliveries and working with cities to help strengthen public transportation and for personal use vehicles. And as we've talked about on a bunch of calls, the opportunity is here for us because we started with safety, and we remain a leader in safety, and we do believe that's the foundation for success, and it builds on the -- all the testing miles that we've done. So we keep coming back to when you create vehicles that drive themselves faithfully, we think there's a lot of potential uses and business opportunities, and that's what we're focused on.","Operator","And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","I wanted to ask two quick questions. One, just one on GDPR then one on cloud. On GDPR, just wondering if you could share with us kind of any impact you're thinking about as the implementation occurs later in May, and so any thoughts you could share there would be great. And then on cloud, Sundar, you had mentioned you're seeing a lot of momentum. You said G Suite, I believe, accelerated in Q1. I was wondering if there was any color on the GCP side that you could share from a growth perspective if that business accelerated or not and kind of how were the deal sites trending for that business in particular.","Sundar Pichai","Great. Maybe I'll do the GDPR first. GDPR, I realize, is a fairly new public OPEC. But for us, it's not new. We started working on GDPR compliance over 18 months ago and have been very, very engaged on it. It's really important, and we care about getting it right. And overall, we have long had a very robust and strong privacy program at Google, too. So we are committed to meeting requirements on May 25 and also long term. We are working very closely with advertisers, publishers and our partners. And we will also update all the privacy policies and controls we provide to users worldwide. So it's a big effort. We are very committed to it. We are very focused on getting it right by our users and partners, and that's where our focus is now. On -- Heather, on cloud, I guess your question was about overall growth, and we are continuing -- the momentum has been very strong on cloud as well. We haven't talked about G Suite much, and so we highlighted it the moment I'm there, but cloud is continuing its great growth. We are seeing it across the board. Things worth I would call out is we are seeing larger deals as well. We are seeing good synergies between G Suite and cloud. Areas where we have done acquisitions like Apigee, they are beginning to work in terms of driving synergies to cloud. And the efforts we are beginning to put particular with our partners, that is beginning to bear fruit as well. So we have go-to-market programs now with SAP, Cisco and Salesforce. And I think we are beginning to see early results from that, and hopefully, that translates into more momentum going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe two for Sundar, if I can. One, on mobile search, continue to call that out as a point of strength in the results. What are you most excited about in terms of either the product innovation or the ability to get consumers to adopt mobile search more broadly on devices globally, which could lead to more ad budgets moving it to mobile search? And then on hardware, you've now been through 2 years of sort of Pixel devices. You've made the aqui-hire of ETC engineers. Can you give us a sense of what you've learned so far from your hardware efforts and how that might evolve product innovation or go-to-market strategies long term?","Sundar Pichai","On mobile search, for me, mobile obviously raises the bar. And if you look at the evolution of Search, we gave from -- we evolved to stay ahead of user expectations, and we evolved from just providing links to answers. I just feel at a high level the next big evolution we are doing as part of mobile search and assistant is to actually help users complete actions, to help get things done. And it's really hard to do at scale, and that's the work we are doing. And as we do that, it'll impact just -- not just the Assistant but mobile search more broadly. And obviously, that has a commercial impact as well. So we continue to be very excited about the opportunities there. On hardware, the exciting part for us is now, I think we have all the end-to-end capabilities of a world-class hardware organization, along with the quality of the software organizations we have always had. And in this area, it truly takes long-term planning. And so for example, if you think about silicon, et cetera, the longer you can do it, the more advantages you have. And so I definitely feel we are taking the steps towards being able to do this well for the long term. Part of that obviously involves scaling of our go-to-market strategies both in the U.S. and internationally so that we can drive adoption. I said earlier, our Net Promoter Scores show that we are right up there with the best-in-class devices and across all the products we have, not just our Pixel, across our Nest family and everything we do. So the opportunity is clearly there. We're going to lean into it, and it takes two to three years to really get to the scale where we want to see it and -- but we are committed to getting there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney","I want to follow up on Heather's question on GDPR, and the question I want to ask is, I understand that you're -- been working for a long time to make sure that you're compliant. But do you think that GDPR or other regulation that you see on the horizon is likely to impact materially the targeting capabilities about that advertisers have on Google? Is there something in the regulation that's going to make Google and its properties less attractive to advertisers? That's the action question I want to ask.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Mark. Above everything else, as we are working through GDPR, we are making sure we are focused on getting the user experience right for our users and our partners. But to clarify your question further, first of all, it's important to understand that most of our ad business is Search, where we rely on very limited information, essentially what is in the keywords to show a relevant ad or product. And so we've been preparing this for 18 months, and I think we are focused on getting the compliance right. It'll be a year's long effort, and we are helping not just us but our publishers and partners. But overall, we think we'll be able to do all that with the positive impact for users and publishers and the advertisers and so our business.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak","I have two. The first one on desktop search. So it's nice to hear that your oldest business is still growing. Just curious, could you give 1 or 2 tangible examples or products that are still driving the desktop search growth? And Sundar, I understand you're always focused on user experience. At a high level, what do you see is the biggest areas potential further improvement in desktop search? And let me ask you the same question about YouTube. What are sort of the biggest areas of tension that you're focused on improving from a user perspective on YouTube right now?","Sundar Pichai","So on desktop search -- sorry, is your question on the user experience on desktop search, how do we see improvements? Look, I mean, the same. First of all, users are having cross-device experiences, cross-screen experiences, right? So I think your desktop search experience, mobile search, everything goes hand-in-hand. And every -- all the work we are doing to make mobile search better translates to desktop search as well. Areas where desktop search historically has been a bit behind is in terms of things like identity and payments and having all that work well to enhance the user experience. And with Chrome now, we are investing a lot in those areas as well, and I think that will contribute overall to improvements there. On YouTube, there are many, many areas we are focused on YouTube. They're always very focused on making sure they are supporting emerging formats, be it mobile live streaming or emerging formats like VR, and so that's an area of focus for us. We are also really looking at what are all-new monetization options for creators beyond advertising. So be it subscriptions, features like super chat, which we have launched, are very popular. We have beta testing sponsorships, merchandise, merchandising and concept, ticketing and et cetera, right? So these are all areas by which we are improving. And obviously, there are additional areas like Music and YouTube TV, which are seeing great momentum as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays.","Ross Sandler","Just two questions, please. Americas revenue accelerated nicely on a currency neutral basis. It's a geography that rarely comes up on your calls. So any color about what's driving that acceleration and the sustainability of what's going on in the Americas region? And then, Ruth, a question on sites TAC. So I know you said the pace of deleverage is going to start to improve next quarter. Is this something that we should expect to happen for a year and then kind of normalize back to pretty steady pace of deleverage? Or is this -- are we over some critical threshold, and we should see this trend of moderating deleverage continue for several years into the future?","Ruth Porat","So on your first question, other Americas. I would say, like the other regions, really pleased with the strength we have. Across the regions, it is obviously one of the smaller ones, so growing at a slightly faster clip and really pleased with the broad strength there. It starts with the sites revenue strength. But on top of that, they benefited from hardware devices launching in some additional markets over the past year. And then in terms of TAC, I would say there's not much to add to what we've already said after some -- a kind of sustained period of stronger increases. We were pleased last quarter to be able to signal that this quarter that pace of change is slowing, and just leave it at that for now.","Operator","And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore.","Anthony DiClemente","I have two, one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, on CapEx, even if we exclude the Chelsea Market one-timer, the gross in CapEx, is it really substantial even on a kind of recurring basis. Should we expect that sort of dramatic growth or step-up in the growth of rate in ongoing CapEx to continue throughout the year? Or other than the Chelsea Market one-timer, were there any -- do we have any reason to think that it was timing in terms of the timing, front-end weighted, it's the first quarter for CapEx? And then secondly on -- Sundar, just a question on YouTube and your media strategy at a higher level. In view of the success of other competitive subscription TV products out there, Internet video products, can you just talk about YouTube Red and any thoughts on ways you can accelerate growth for your YouTube subscription video products, whether that may be organic investment and content original production or even via acquisition?","Ruth Porat","So in terms of CapEx, it's about equally split between facilities and our technical infrastructure. And as you know that we have the $2.4 billion purchase in New York as well as discontinued ground-up development projects. Facilities does tend to be lumpier over time. We are continuing with the ground-up development projects. And as a reminder, we do favor owning rather than leasing real estate when we see good opportunities, and that has served us well over the years. But I think more to your question with respect to technical infrastructure, that reflects investments in compute power to support growth that we see across Google, and the largest component is on machines. It's also on data centers and undersea cables. And on machines, the biggest contributor is the demand that we're seeing. So in particular, it's the expanding application of the machine learning efforts across Alphabet, plus the requirements for cloud and Search and YouTube, and then secondarily, the increased cost of newer technologies, CPUs, memory, network. So I think, really, to answer your question most directly, it reflects the demand that we're seeing, so I wouldn't want to suggest a one-off in terms of the investments we're making in technical infrastructure. And then in terms of the data centers, we are investing globally. We currently have over 20 sites on 4 continents, and that's under different stages of construction, as Sundar noted. And it's across the U.S. Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina, Iowa. So we're really building out to support the growth that we're seeing.","Sundar Pichai","Sorry, on the second question on YouTube, for sure, the adoption and feedback across both YouTube Red and YouTube Music has been great to see. We are doing a lot more work there. You will see us continue to invest further and develop those offerings better, and as part of that, further drive adoption. So for example, YouTube Originals end up playing a big part in YouTube Red subscriptions. And so far, we have launched in a handful of markets, and we'll continue to roll it out to more markets there. And on YouTube Music, we are working on enhancing the product, and I think this definitely create opportunities there as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets.","Daniel Salmon","Sundar, I had two for you. First, during the quarter, where there were some reports of changes in leadership that your Search and AI divisions functionally sounds like separating leadership over those 2 very large, important businesses for the company. Could you talk a little bit more about that and how that may impact broader strategy for the company? And then second, a little bit more technical one on your advertising business you launched, shopping actions during the quarter with a pay-per-sale model, pricing model. And I was just curious to hear what type of feedback you were getting from advertisers that led to a product with that pricing model in particular, any other features of shopping actions that you think are important to highlight.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Dan. Search has been leading the company in terms of how they have been adopting machine learning and AI, and it's really working well through Search and Assistant. We sense that, obviously, as an AI-first company, AI cuts across everything we do in Google. And so as an organization, it's a horizontal organization, which needs to serve all our areas and in some ways, the change reflects that. And we have very capable leaders. Jeff, who runs -- was the Founder of Google Brain and really well positioned to lead our AI efforts. And Ben has been at Google since the early days of Search, started in Google in 2000 and has been driving Search for over 18 years. And so we are very excited, and we think the changes will serve the company well. On your second thing, the question was on shopping actions?","Daniel Salmon","And in particular, the price per sale pricing model.","Sundar Pichai","So I think we announced the -- this new service in March, and the feedback has been very positive. I mentioned earlier, which is for retailers, when they are testing this, they see it drives an increase in basket size. So that means users are interacting with the product well, and that's all I have to share for now. It's still early days.","Operator","And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird.","Colin Sebastian","A couple for me, please. First, on the cloud business. I was wondering if you could provide any color, at least in the relative momentum you're seeing in that segment from infrastructure services compared to platform or software services. And then related to the adoption of AMP. I guess, a key question we get asked is whether that ultimately changes usage, and maybe you have some perspective on this from Android. But in the ecosystem between mobile web pages and app usage, if you're seeing any shift among users between those formats.","Sundar Pichai","On the first question of cloud, look, I mean, I think the main thing I would say is the fundamental drivers of adoption of Google Cloud based on what we hear back from customers is our advantage in data analytics and machine learning. The fact that we really support open, agile development environment. Kubernetes has literally become the standard for workloads and the fact that we are open in terms of how we approach this space. Security is becoming a big differentiator for us and something we've been leading for a while, and I think that's driving it. G Suite, as I called out earlier, is a good synergistic driver. G Suite is doing well, and clearly, a very unique offering, and it's gotten very comprehensive. And so I think overall, it comes together well. On your second question around AMP, AMP has been definitely very successful. It's really made publisher content much more friendly for users in terms of latency and the user experience, and hence, that option has been great. For sure, AMP has definitely helped the mobile web, and that's part of the big reasons we did it. Mobile web is still a big part of how users consume content, especially around news, and so us investing there clearly makes a difference. I guess, for example, when we look at, I don't know, J.Crew adopted AMP, their mobile page loading times are now over 90% faster. And now they are integrating the Google payment request API. That reduces checkout times from 2 minutes to 30 seconds or so. So things like that. We are going to constantly stay on improving the mobile web, and that plays a big part in how our ecosystem works.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.","Michael Nathanson","I have two, one for Sundar, one for Ruth. First, Sundar, can you give us any sense of how Google Home consumers are using Search in these devices differently than maybe the traditional ways of Search? And you're finding in those homes, is it additive to overall search activity? And then for Ruth, if you look at the last page of press release, where you've shown the new monetization metrics, you see a real increase in the cost per impression on network sites. So can you talk about maybe what's happening there? Is there a mix shift types of publishers, types of products? Or is that just market inflation?","Sundar Pichai","Look, for sure, Google Home gives rise to a lot of new and unique use cases, actions that are a big part of it. Call mom is a good example of something you say to Google Home a lot. I can -- which is different than what you would say to Search. We see this as a good complementary thing. You will see Search embrace some of the capabilities you find in Google Assistant and Google Home and vice versa. And so overall, I view this as additive in the long term, and we are definitely just getting started there.","Ruth Porat","And then on the network monetization trends. First, just to give people a bit more color. When we launched the AdSense businesses, our network revenues were largely click-based. And over time, there's been a meaningful mix change in our business given the strong growth in programmatic, which is impression-based. So as a result, the shift now covers more of the business. And then in terms of the question on impression growth versus CPM growth, as we've discussed on prior calls, the network business is actually a number of different businesses. And then within that, we have flat year-on-year growth in the number of impressions that was driven by efforts to improve user experience through a reduction of less relevant ads and AFC. And so these changes had a positive impact on the year-on-year growth in CPMs. And then the trend and impressions in CPMs can clearly be volatile from quarter-to-quarter as we're optimizing for the user publisher and advertiser, but it really goes to the efforts that we make.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies.","Brent Thill","Just as a question regarding any changes on your framework for growth versus operating margins. The last few quarters, you've seen steady top line acceleration, yet the margins were down. Can you just talk about how you think about it at a high level for this year? Any changes from the past?","Ruth Porat","Yes, it's an important question. As we've talked about on many, many calls, we have been and remain focused on supporting long-term revenue and profit growth, and we think the opportunity set ahead of us is quite extraordinary. And as I said in opening comments, just given our confidence and as we're looking forward, we want to make sure we're investing appropriately in the next phase of innovation, and we have clarity about some very compelling opportunities. And then our judgment, that enables us to maximize shareholder value. So we're taking the steps really to put in place the support for long-term -- longer-term growth. Part of what I'm saying, you can see in our sites revenue growth, try to make that clear in opening comments, we see this consistent, strong momentum globally, and we're really excited about the still sizable opportunity led by mobile search. And so we're continuing to invest to enhance the user and advertiser experience, and thereby, extend the growth in our ads business. You can see this also in the trend on the CapEx spend.","As I noted in our opening comments, the investments we're making there really provide the compute capacity to support our growth outlook, and that's supporting the opportunities that come out of machine learning and the Assistant. And then we also see extraordinary upside in the newer markets, as Sundar has talked about, most notably cloud computing and hardware. And so we're investing to support the long-term growth opportunity there. And then finally, when we look at the market opportunity in both self-driving cars and life sciences, our judgment is it makes sense to place the kinds of investments that we are. And with all of this, what also hasn't changed is we appreciate the importance of prioritization and picking our spots, and we're keenly focused on steps we can take to both make the right investments with the proper intensity while being diligent about long-term plans and returns. So at a high level, the approach hasn't changed. You're seeing the investments here.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Stephen Ju","So Sundar, I think one of the themes that you as a management team has talked about has been to, I guess, democratize advertising with AI to help SMBs who may have found advertising across Google's ad products to be perhaps overwhelming. So can you talk about the rate of uptake among the smaller advertisers and whether or not this is helping to catalyze growth in new budgets and where these guys might otherwise have not been able to advertise before? There's SMBs and then there's local also. So what will be the plan to get this technology into the hands of folks who will want to use them?","Sundar Pichai","Look, I mean, there's a big focus for us. And today, SMBs are -- play a big role in our ecosystem, and we are doing a lot of stuff to support them across the board, right, and from things like in our offerings to help SMBs get an online presence, create a website, be discovered in local, search and Google Maps. So we do a lot of detailed work to make sure SMBs are working well. We are also doing a lot of stuff on local as well, including efforts that are even around local services. So we have very specific initiatives. This is going to be -- I mean, it's actually -- to us, it's bread and butter of what we do here, and so there's a lot of effort underway, not to mention the fact that we provide G Suite for businesses as they scale up as well. So it's an end-to-end offering, and we'll -- you'll continue to see us invest more here.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks.","Ellen West","Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ms. Jane Penner, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.","Jane Penner","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.","Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations page for the latest Company news and update, please check it out. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.","Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Larry.","Larry Page","Thank you. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Google had another strong quarter with $14.9 billion in revenue and great product progress. We are closing in our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device.","Research has shown that people tend to overestimate the impact of technology in the short-term, yet underestimate the scale of change longer term. For years everyone talked about the multi screen world. Now it\u2019s arrived, but on a scale few imagined, people increasingly have more than one device and screens are proliferating in the home as well as wearable screens like watches and Google Glass.","When android was still a (indiscernible) project I used to feel kind of guilty visiting the team. We are a search company and building a new operating system wasn\u2019t an obvious move to most people. It turns out that was a lot of (indiscernible) over 1 billion android devices have now been activated worldwide and 1.5 million devices are led off everyday.","I\u2019m also tremendously excited about Chromebooks, which are growing fast and defining the more general decline in laptops. It\u2019s like the chrome browser; updates are seamless and frequent improving security and usability. It was a great example of technology doing the hard work, so you can get all the stuff that matters.","Two weeks ago we launched the new HP Chromebook 11. Its beautifully designed and light weight and just over 2 pounds and at $279, highly affordable. Best of all, it has a high power micro USB charger that can also charge your android phone. Recharging isn\u2019t too much of a sweat and there is tremendous potential to innovate. So it\u2019s great to see progress here.","This quarter we also launched the Moto X. The first one that Motorola has developed and produced since Google acquired the company. Super fast and clean and the voice features are great. While it\u2019s still early days, Dennis and the team have already transformed Motorola\u2019s product quality. Now they\u2019re working to build out marketing and distribution.","As screens multiply people navigate across them seamlessly becomes more and more important. That\u2019s why I love Chromecast which we launched in July and immediately became a best seller. On your phone, tablet or laptop and start playing some music from Youtube or a show from Google play or Netflix. One click the content is there on the bigger screen in your home, your TV, all for just $35.","And unlike some other streaming devices, you can continue to email search and share as the Chromecast handles the hard work without draining your device battery, genuine multi-tasking in a multi screen world. We\u2019ve also making great progress across devices with Youtube. Almost 40% of Youtube\u2019s traffic now comes from mobile, up from 6% two years ago. And in August we updated our Youtube apps for android and iOS. You can now leave a video playing at the bottom of your screen while you explore other content.","Our execution in velocity and search from maps is getting better and better and from a very high base. A new map app for iOS and android shipped in July, but is specifically for downloads to make the most of this larger screens. And in September we\u2019ve rebuilt our entire mobile search experience of a simple card interface that is easy to read and have designed, that is optimized for touch.","Our momentum on voice search is tremendous. We added four new languages this quarter making available on over 78 languages and accents. We\u2019ve also expanded the quick answers, we can provide just for you. Fast Google for your flight details and up here instantly in your search results, no digging around in your email required. And the search across Google+ photos is extraordinary. Search for sunsets and all the pictures you've ever taken of sunsets to appear instantly. If you haven't tried it, prepare to be amazed.","About two years ago, when I became CEO again, my goal was to ensure that Google maintains the passion and soul of a start-up as we grow. It's why I've worked so hard to increase the velocity and execution. So we create great products people love to use and iterate fast to ensure they get better and better. Because great is just never good enough.","When you look across the company, it's amazing how well the teams are executing. For example, we rolled out Enhanced Campaigns in AdWords across all devices for all our advertisers in less than a year. Of course none of this would happen without great people and we are so lucky that we have them. I'd like to thank all the Googlers and Motorolans who make everything possible. Keep up that velocity and execution.","Before I hand over to Patrick, I want to let you know that going forward, I won't be joining every earnings call. Patrick and Nikesh do a great job covering our business each quarter and they'll continue to do that great work. I know you all would love to have me on, but you are also depending on me to ruthlessly prioritize my time for the benefit of the business. I'm very confident you are in good hands with Patrick and Nikesh.","So now, over to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us again. Without further ado why don't we just dive into the details of Google's financial performance in Q3? So here we go. Our gross consolidated revenue was just shy of $15 billion at $14.9 billion. The overall business was up 6% quarter-over-quarter and 12% year-over-year.","Our Google segment, gross revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year to $13.8 billion and was up 5% quarter-over-quarter without currency fluctuations, Google segment revenue would have actually grown 21% year-over-year and the currency impact on sequential growth was actually immaterial in our case this quarter.","Google sites revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $9.4 billion and was up 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by the strength in our core search advertising business. The advertising policy decisions that we implemented earlier this year to ensure good user experience continued to negatively impact Google's network revenue in the short term, and therefore our network revenue was in fact flat year-over-year to $3.1 billion and was down 1% quarter-over-quarter.","Despite the short-term pressures we continue to believe that this is clearly the right answer for our users and shareholders in the long term. And finally to finish Google's segment on a positive note, Google's other revenue grew 85% year-over-year to $1.2 billion and was up 18% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play store drove year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth in this line.","Turning to Motorola segment, our gross revenue there was $1.2 billion. As Larry mentioned, while it's still the early days, Dennis and the team have already transformed Motorola's product quality and they're working now at building marketing and distribution.","By the way, some of you may have noticed that our total consolidated revenue does not exactly equal to some of our segment revenue this quarter. This is driven by new transactions in our Motorola segment resulting in intersegment and certain deferred revenues that are eliminated in our consolidated results.","Coming back to our Google segment, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter, up 26% year-over-year, 8% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 8% year-over-year and down 12% quarter-over-quarter. And we should note that the currency fluctuations had a real minimal impact on Q3 cost-per-click.","Once again, I wish to remind everyone that our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a whole set of factors discussed on previous calls. They include geographic mix, channel mix, property mix as well as product and policy changes.","Turning to geographic performance of our Google segment, we continue to see steady performance in the U.S. and the U.K. and strong performance in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculation.","The U.S. revenue was up 13% year-over-year to $6.1 billion and it's worth noting that network revenue that I mentioned a bit earlier which continues to be impacted by ongoing policy decisions skew toward the U.S. The U.K. was up 14% year-over-year to $1.4 billion which includes a small $17 million benefit from our hedging program. In fixed FX the U.K. grew 15% year-over-year.","In our non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. accounted for 46% of total revenue or $6.3 billion. This was up 28% year-over-year which includes a $5 million benefit from our hedging program and in fixed FX terms, our rest of world actually grew 32% year-over-year.","Coming back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business, our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $3.3 billion in Q3 excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled 4.3 billion again excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring. For a non-GAAP operating profit was $4.3 billion in Q3 resulting in non-GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 29%.","For Google segment our traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion or 24% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $2.3 billion excluding $133 million of SBC. Google segment operating expenses were $3.9 billion also excluding SBC of $723 million.","Depreciation and amortization expense on our property, plant and equipment for the Google segment was $630 million this quarter. And our Google segment operating profit as a result was a strong $4.6 billion in Q3 resulting in Google segment operating margin of 34%.","At Motorola our total segment operating expenses including cost of revenue were $1.4 billion. That excludes $30 million of stock-based compensation and $12 million of Motorola restructuring charges. Please keep in mind that intangible amortization expense attributed to the Google segment and Motorola are in fact included in these segment measures.","Of the $281 million in consolidated intangible amortization expense in the quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola of which $116 million was allocated to Google segment and $37 million allocated to the Motorola segment. And as a result, the operating loss at Motorola segment was $248 million in Q3 and operating margins for that segment were negative 21%.","Headcount for the consolidated business was roughly 1,500 people, up in Q3. The Google segment added just about 2,000 people during the quarter and in total the consolidated company ended the quarter with approximately 46,000 full-time employees. Our effective tax rate was 15% in Q3. Our tax rate this quarter was impacted by the continued mix shift of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.","Let me now turn to cash management. Our other income and expense was 24 million for this quarter. The impact of FAS 133 expense from our hedging program and realized losses mostly offset interest income in this quarter. And as you know we often get questions on quarter-to-quarter volatility of our hedging costs.","So to help everyone understand this better, we put together a video tutorial on the topic. You can find the new video on our Investor Relations website. I hope you find it helpful and let us know what you think. For more detail on OI&E, please again refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.","We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.1 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.3 billion. This quarter the majority of our CapEx was spent on production equipment, data center construction and real estate purchases. As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest for the long term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area of investment for us.","Consequently, our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, very strong again. So there you have it. Strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth fully in the opportunities, areas including Mobile Business, Android, Chrome, YouTube, Enterprise just to name a few. With that I\u2019ll hand it off to Nikesh, who\u2019ll cover more details of our business performance in the quarter and after these remarks we\u2019ll open up the phone lines for questions. Here you go, Nikesh.","Nikesh Arora","Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned our business had a strong quarter with $13.8 billion in Google segment gross revenue. Overall performance was strong in the retail sector. We had good growth in Japan, South Korea and Australia. There are three key areas I want to talk about today, that are big growth drivers for us and our partners. First; our continued efforts to make advertising seamless, effective and measurable across multiple screens. Second; our progress in bringing bad advertisers online with a special emphasis on our efforts that are on Youtube; and third our early investments in commerce and shopping to help users, retailers and merchants. And last say a few words about newly areas like digital content, hardware and enterprise.","On seamless advertising; it's been a few months since our advertisers moved over to enhanced campaigns and AdWords. Clients are telling us they like the new system. Many are still adjusting their campaigns and keywords and developing their multi-screen bidding strategies. For example; we\u2019re seeing advertisers bidding more frequently in mobile keywords because enhanced campaigns makes it so much easier to do so. They\u2019re discovering how they can use the needed capabilities in mobile and their ads, like location Click2Call. Example is discover who has just increased their mobile spend and used it to promote their [it card].","Talking about mobile, we\u2019ve also launched cross device measurement tools and analytics. There are three observations here. First; mobile is driving higher online conversion. American Apparels found that mobile ads were actually driving 16% more conversions than they initially thought and as a result they\u2019re now investing more to drive more sales. Second, mobile drives more phone calls. On average there are more than 40 million calls driven by Google ads every month, this is twice as much as it was a year ago. Third, mobile drives in-store traffic.","Moving over to brand in YouTube. You\u2019ve seen that our CPG and entertainment clients have moved online at greater speed with our efforts that are on brand. Spend by our CPG clients on displaying YouTube has grown over 75% over the past two years. For example, the Google YouTube campaign for Dove\u2019s Camera Shy brand in more than 20 countries and delivered over 62 million views for Unilever. We\u2019re also partnering very closely with agencies, we really like integrating our technology, insights and media with their creativity and client relationships.","For agencies, marketers and Googlers it's a huge win, win, win. All of the top 10 global agencies now use our DoubleClick products. On the other side YouTube continues to do well. Video ads which include CUview now form a significant part of our YouTube in brand advertising and they\u2019re growing north of 75% year-over-year. We found that YouTube is our brand torch bearer. It offers brands valuable engaged audiences, terrific reach and compelling context. Smart brands are really loving their engagement with YouTube.","Moving on to commerce and shopping. As Google search moves to provide people with answers and entities not just links, we\u2019re making good progress helping people take commercial access too like buying products. We\u2019re seeing great traction on product listing ads both in desktop and mobile. As part of this moved to a seamless purchasing experience we\u2019re also helping retailers offer better payment solutions to their customers particularly on mobile where it's traditionally been difficult. Google Wallet InstaBuy helps merchants here up implementing instant buy Google (indiscernible) saw that from May to August users of Google Wallet on their Android app had a purchase conversion rate that was four times higher than other shoppers.","Finally I want to talk about an area which we\u2019re being putting more emphasis on which is our investment in emerging non-ads businesses. As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see acceleration in the new businesses such as hardware, digital content and enterprise. As Larry mentioned Chromecast and Chromebooks are enjoying great success. Chromebooks are now available in over 8000 locations around the world and are being used in more than 20% of school districts in United States. We\u2019re also rolling out unified Google experience in more than 750 Best Buy stores to showcase Chromebooks, Chromecast and the newest Nexus devices under our one Google branded design.","On digital apps and content we continue to work hard to roll out Google Play in more markets around the world and add content to it. For instance this quarter to help students go back to school we added a comprehensive catalogue of textbooks to Google Play Books for rental purchase. We brought on content partners like HBO and DC Entertainment. This quarter we brought Play Music to eight more countries and Play Books to 18 new countries. So for example now users in Russia can enjoy music and users in Indonesia can enjoy books. There\u2019s tremendous momentum here and we look forward to making progress in this area.","Another strong area of recovering and growing revenue is our enterprise software business, making available the best of Google for work. Some great new clients this quarter include whirlpool which is now using Google Apps to help 30,000 employees collaborate and innovate more quickly. In education, apps for education is being used by 30 million students, faculty and staff worldwide. Beyond apps, Amtrak uses Google Maps to let people see all the trains in the U.S. in real time, and we\u2019re continuing to invest in the Google Cloud Platform which has over 300,000 customers including Sanmina, a Fortune 500 Company using cloud platforms to build internal applications that improve their efficiency across their offices globally.","Lastly let me call out the efforts of our marketing team that continues to roll out the Google Welcome Mat to the world. To put on our third annual Google Science Fair honoring 15 global finalists from the ages of 13 to 18 from around the world where we hosted 400 partners and customers who are at our Annual Site Cast Event, more interestingly to introduce the newest version of Android called KitKat, we\u2019ve built a partnership with Nestle to get more than 50 million special Android KitKat chocolate bars on store shelves around the world. And I have to give a shout out to the wonderful ad for our Nexus devices featuring the great sport of cricket that our marketing team is running in Australia, that\u2019s a bit of a personal favorite sport. With that, let me hand it over to Patrick. Thank you again to all the Googlers for all their hard work in getting us here.","Patrick Pichette","So there you have it folks. Why don\u2019t we have Jamie turn on the lines and then we\u2019ll take your questions. So Jamie, over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, two questions please. Could you talk about how long you think it will take for advertisers to move over to fully embrace the multi-screen advertising world which enhanced campaign should enable or facilitate. And then secondly the skunk\u2019s works question, voice recognition technology at the Company I think it\u2019s something you\u2019ve been working on for years, I think it's what enables wearable devices in the future. Can you talk about how far along you are in developing a technology to be where you want it to be? Thank you.","Larry Page","Yeah; thanks Mark for the questions. I think the first part of your question I\u2019ll to send Nikesh in a minute and I\u2019ll take the voice recognition question. I think we made tremendous progress on voice recognition. Even in period of months probably the last couple of months or six months the accuracy has gone up quite a bit. If you haven't tried it, I\u2019d really recommend you to try that, it's super fast, on the motor axe, you can say, okay Google now, even if your phone is turned off it will turn on and answer your question. So, I think we\u2019re super excited about that, and I think we made tremendous strives and we\u2019ll continue to improve accuracy in that and to make the products better. But I think they\u2019re already super useful and we have a lot of usage coming from voice. So Nikesh, in the enhanced campaigns.","Nikesh Arora","Hey, Mark as you know on the topic of enhanced campaigns the challenge we had as we moved into a multi-screen world was, everybody was producing solutions where we had to basically run campaigns on different devices in a different way because it's this evolution that happened from desktop to mobile to video ads et cetera. And effectively what our team working with Susan and Sheila\u2019s team have been able to do is to provide one single interface and one single mechanism to be able to manage our campaigns across multiple devices. Now that\u2019s a good thing because it improves process, let\u2019s them see the ROI across various devices with the analytic tools that we\u2019ve come up with. But also there\u2019s a lot of work that needs to happen on the advertisers side because they have to develop beautiful experiences for their customers on mobile devices as well as on their screen. So I think it's a process where we\u2019re all going through this together, advertisers love this new mechanism. They\u2019re adjusting their keywords and they\u2019re bidding models based on all this new effort and we\u2019re seeing great progress in terms people are already advertising those. But not only that, we\u2019re also working with all of our advertisers to make sure they have great experiences on their other screens and other devices so that they can truly leverage this. So, I think this is definitely the sort of the first set of steps we\u2019ve taken to towards future or multi-screen devices and multi-screen advertising but we think this is the way things are going to keep evolving.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, Larry.","Patrick Pichette","Jamie, why don't we go to our next call?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital Inc.","Larry, can you discuss Google's overall ecommerce strategy, how the Knowledge Graph structure data plays into it and generally how Google can improve the users' ecommerce experience? And then Nikesh, you touched briefly on the brand efforts and I was looking at some data recently that shows that over the past 15 years virtually all the games for online advertising has come at the extent of print and radio and none of it has come from television budgets. What specifically is happening now that makes you think it's more likely for the television dollars to finally begin to come online and to Google in particular? And then just a quick housekeeping one for Patrick. Can you just give us a bit more detail on how the accounting works for the intersegment transactions and how it impacts the consolidated model? Thanks.","Larry Page","Like a three-way question [indiscernible]. So I think on the ecommerce side, I think Google's been used for e-commerce for forever and we're really excited about doing a better job of that. I think we want to remove friction when people are buying online or in the real world. We know people often click on an ad in a mobile device and then make their purchase on the laptop or they might in fact buy it in the store and we need to really get the conversion data there to the advertiser. So I think we've done work across all those things, across multi-screens, multi-devices from online to offline. We recently launched cross-device measurement in AdWords and we're also just trying to make it easier for people to buy things in general. It's as simple as that's same day shipping in local inventory and search. Like I said, we're just looking to reduce friction and we're very excited about that.","Nikesh Arora","Yes. Hi, Ben. If you look at the last 15 years of history like you talk about, a lot of the gains of online advertising have actually come at the expense of what we would call performance advertising. Anytime you wanted to interact with users, get people to come into your store, get people to buy your product, get people to click on your website, all those gains have happened in performance which has been great. But what's beginning to happen is as the watch time on various online video sites continues to grow, as more and more online video begins to be available in a nonlinear fashion in television screens or recent as Larry talked about Chromecast, that stuff or a bunch of the gaming devices, a bunch of other TV solutions, they're beginning to see a lot more watch time being expended either on your desktop or on your multi-screen devices or even on your television. As that begins to happen that advertising is more addressable, more directly attributable and provides more measurement and capabilities. So we believe that that's definitely a more superior opportunity for advertisers to be able to attract their brand customers and actually know who's at the other end. So I think that trend is definitely in the right direction and we're getting upward.","Patrick Pichette","So why don't I take the last question which was the housekeeping item. Actually this is pretty straightforward change, Ben. So in Q3 our Motorola and Google segments purchased and sold services to each other and these transactions are reflected in our Google and Motorola segment revenues. The main thing analysts need to realize as they update their model this time is that the total consolidated revenue will no longer necessarily like in the quarters where there is transaction between the two equal the sum of the Google and Motorola segment revenues. So analysts who currently sum up our segment revenues and profits to derive consolidated estimates should need to model in elimination lines for the intersegment revenue and profit in order to get their consolidated estimates. So that's simple as that.","Thanks for the questions. So, Jamie, why don't we go \u2013 thanks, Ben \u2013 to our next caller.","Operator","We'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Larry, I hope that when you come up with voice recognition, it can deal with funny accents. Anyway the perception by people outside the company is that Google spends a material amount in long-term R&D that will not generate revenue in the next two years or so. Larry, can you help us understand how you think about funding this project and how much do they correspond versus your total R&D budget? And secondly, Patrick, you said in the past that CapEx is lumpy and we should expect fluctuations but now we have had three quarters of what looks like high CapEx versus recent past. Have the last few quarters been normal? Thank you.","Larry Page","Yes, thanks, Carlos. I think we definitely are working on accents, so I appreciate that. I think that on the long-term R&D question, I think we don't break all this on detail, but I would say that, my stronghold in general is to get people to spend money on long-term R&D. In most companies I think even companies that have significant R&D budgets, if you look at that maybe 99% of it ends up being really incremental, which is relatively small improvements to kind of your existing businesses, and maybe 1% of that ends up being kind of true long-term things like Android was when it got started. So I think I kind of view my job as the opposite thing is to get people to spend on the long-term R&D. I do think people have a perception that's material. I don't think that \u2013 that's not been my experience and so it's very hard to actually spend money on long-term things in any kind of meaningful way. And even the investments we've announced, things like Calico or rather an absolute dollar number's probably significant amounts, they're not significant for Google. And I think you should actually be asking me to make more significant investments. I wish I knew how to do that but I think it's actually very difficult to spend kind of meaningful amounts of money relative to goal scale on things that are speculative.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Larry. Carlos, on the issue of CapEx just to reiterate the fact that the majority of the CapEx this quarter was spent on production equipment, so like machines, data center construction looking ahead and building the capacity ahead of our needs to get the flexibility and real estate purchases, so we had a number of kind of really good opportunistic purchases in the portfolio we were targeting and they kind of came online this quarter, so pretty pleased with that. I think that overall investors should see this as a very positive sign and a positive signal. As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest really for the long term and just a conversation we're having with Larry on the topic of R&D. And our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area for investment for us. It's really important that when we see signals of or opportunities where we need capacity, the worst thing for us would be to actually not have it in terms of machines and data center capacity. So the strategic value of having it for flexibility for our long-term positions are really important. That's what you see reflected in our investments right now.","So thank you for your question, Carlos.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Jamie, let's go to our next call, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Larry, just to follow-up on Ben's question earlier, it seems like you guys have all the pieces in place with Android, with Maps, with Google Now, Wallet, credit card information in the Play store to kind of vertically integrate the experience from research search to purchase in the local and transactional areas, kind of the closing of the loop if you will. So can you just elaborate on the overall strategy and how does the recent cross screen conversion estimates enhance play into that? Thanks.","Larry Page","Thanks, Ross. We have all positions available [indiscernible]. I think we certainly agree with that. I think it was a pretty good description of me. We all account many different pieces of your commercial experiences. I think in general I mean now our experience for users is not that seamless and there is lots of different pieces of technology and processes in order to make commerce happen and so on. So I think we have got something we absolutely are looking at improving about closing the loop and so on. I mean I think your question actually is pretty good, so really I don't know that I can add much more.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you for your question. Jamie, let's go to the next caller please.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. My question was for Larry. Since you've come back into the CEO's role, one of the things we've noticed with Google is that your own advertising spending has moved up and once upon a time Google was a company that didn't need to advertise and obviously you're in a lot more businesses these days from where you started, but maybe just philosophically how you view that for Google long term as you do launch into more secondary products other than search. And then just one quick follow-up with the Canadian Government announcing this week that they\u2019ll look to pursue unbundling of TV subscriptions; would you ever consider taking Google Fiber to a market outside of the U.S?","Larry Page","Yes, Dan thanks for the questions. And I think we saw a lot of advertising and we do a modest amount of advertising. I think we find that pretty useful and we\u2019ve gone better at doing it, and I think it's good for our business, it's good for us to understand kind of the advertising perspective from a advertisers point of view given that\u2019s some big business for us. I might want Nikesh to elaborate a little bit on that. In Fiber, I think it's really just early days. We\u2019re just getting going on that.","Nikesh Arora","Yeah, to follow-up on the marketing question, I think we still encourage our product teams to go out there and get their products to be used by users, the [merits] of the products, because we believe that\u2019s all the marketing that they can have. But as our products get more and more popular there are many part of the world we want to make sure there\u2019s awareness for those products and people understand what the capabilities and features are. That\u2019s the only time we bring in marketing to kick in. And the other area we do a lot of marketing in is in trying to make sure that our advertisers understand the advertising opportunity so that they can actually can spend money with us; so that\u2019s roughly how we think about marketing. But the primary focus is definitely on making sure we create great products that users use and the products stand and get (indiscernible) their own merits.","Larry Page","All right. That\u2019s very correct. Let\u2019s go to the next question.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.","Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray","Hi, good afternoon. Question for Larry in terms of, you talked about R&D spending and just the amount that you\u2019re going to be gauging at. Can you talk specifically about self driving cars that realizes way down the road, but how real is this as a business and then separately in terms of CPCs how should we see these -- how should we see enhanced campaigns impacting CPCs over the next few quarters? Thanks.","Larry Page","Okay, great questions from Gene; thank you. So I think, I guess on self driving cars specifically I think for any big innovation I think you overestimate short-term and underestimate long-term, that\u2019s probably good summary for self driving cars. I think we made tremendous progress and we\u2019ve driven large amounts of miles, how we change the business from being something that wasn\u2019t going to happen at all to something that now is somewhere inevitable and people\u2019s feelings about it which I think is tremendous progress. That said it\u2019s still pretty early days from the product, I don\u2019t know exactly what I have been saying but its still ways from being a commercial product. Probably overestimate that in the short-term like I said and underestimate that in the long-term. Now for the second part of the question.","Patrick Pichette","Why don\u2019t I jump in for a second, CPCs. Listen we don\u2019t, because you asked the question about, what do we expect quarter over the coming quarters. We don\u2019t really manage the quarterly CPC trends. We actually focus on the user and the advertiser ROI. So in general right we attribute CPC trends to a combination of those five factors I talked about, FX the three mix effects of mobile versus desktop, emerging markets versus developed markets, the channel mix between our sites and our network, then a number of products and policy changes; that\u2019s really the big driver. I think that we\u2019re really pleased as Nikesh mentioned enhanced campaigns is a great platform that enables us for a future and as long as we actually have the format that delivers the great ROI then enhanced campaigns will just accelerate this in the future and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on. So, it's really the complex puzzle and it's important that not only we think about CPCs in the context of all the factors I talked about. But what's even more important is the dynamic of those CPCs and page clicks together. That\u2019s really the magic that actually talks about our growth.","Larry Page","All right. Our next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies & Co.","Yeah, hi it's Tim O'Shea for Brian Pitz. I know it's still early, but can you give us a broad sense for how you\u2019re feeling about the holiday shopping season, and do you have any sense of the updated Google shopping or PLA program has made you better positioned to capitalize this holiday. And then just quickly can you give us a sense of what kind of attraction you\u2019re seeing from the recent implementation of localized PLAs during the quarter? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Just to say that we clearly do not, as you all know we don\u2019t give any sense of what's going on in the fourth quarter. We actually just are closing our third quarter so we don\u2019t give forward guidance on any of it. I think maybe Nikesh can give a sense of where PLAs are going in general.","Nikesh Arora","Yeah, thanks Patrick. Tim, I think the important part in PLAs since I mentioned in the prepared remarks is that we are transitioning from giving users answers in terms of links to taking them down to entities and PLAs in a product listing ads is definitely a big step in that direction because we believe that\u2019s a great answer for the user and a good user experience of the long-term especially more interesting in mobile devices. So, from a long-term user experience perspective we believe that is the right direction; that is a good user experience to have, not going to particularly comment how that is going to impact, what happens in the next few weeks, for the next few quarters?","Larry Page","All right. Our next question.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Ken Sena with Evercore.","Ken Sena - Evercore Partners","Hi, thank you. On Google Play it's my understanding that much of the 30% that developers don\u2019t keep actually goes to carriers and OEMs. So I was just wondering if you can update us maybe on those negotiations and kind of when you see Google maybe receiving a greater portion of plays the economics; and then maybe if you could just update us too on your thoughts on travel. Thank you.","Larry Page","Okay, Nikesh will take the play part there.","Nikesh Arora","Yeah, on Google Play as you know that Google Play has been something that our teams have worked really hard on in the last two years to make sure because that sort of fills out the Android ecosystem and as a key part of making the Android experience a great experience by having great content, great apps on the Google Play system. And in terms of economics, the economics like you said rightfully are shared between developers, carriers, OEMs and us and our key with Google Play is to make sure that there is a robust ecosystem. People like Android devices that provides some great functionality and we believe anybody who brings value to that ecosystem should have economics in that ecosystem once a carrier, OEM or a developer or us. We\u2019re not going to specifically talk about who keeps what part of the economics, but just to say that we\u2019re comfortable with the way the economics work out, and the more important part is, it is helping drive the ecosystem in the right direction.","Larry Page","Also Nikesh on travel.","Nikesh Arora","Yeah, on travel we continue to work on travel. As you know we have a great exciting product on flight search and we have our IDA business and we\u2019re happen with the business the way it is. We are working hard on making sure that the entity level concepts that applies to a product it also applies for travel as in terms of flight search.","Ken Sena - Evercore Partners","All right. Thank you.","Larry Page","All right. The next question.","Operator","And we will go next to Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird & Co.","Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great. Thanks very much. First question is, curious how you guys are thinking about the future of cookies in online advertising, obviously a lot of chatter about privacy issues and perhaps Google working on that ideas and alternative. And then secondly haven\u2019t heard a whole lot about Japan, although we\u2019re seeing pretty -- fairly rapid shift to android in that market, I wonder if you can comment on the Google business Japan and the pace of growth there? Thank you.","Larry Page","Okay. So maybe Nikesh can you address the cookie version?","Nikesh Arora","Yes, I mean, from our perspective we believe that technological enhancements can definitely improve user security in order to make sure that the web continues to remain economically viable in that transition. So we\u2019ve a lot of concept to this area, but it\u2019s very early right now to try and actually elaborate them and talk about what\u2019s going to work, what\u2019s not going to work. But as I said the primary motive is to make sure that we can keep enhancing technologically what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s going to make sure that if we don\u2019t bring the system and you make sure that things stay secure and economically viable.","In terms of Japan, as I mentioned Japan has been good for us this quarter. And as you rightfully identified that we\u2019re -- we continue to see robust growth in the sort of the multi screen space. In that market, clearly it\u2019s an early adopter market as it relates to mobility and tablets and devices. So you can -- we\u2019re feeling very good about how the consumer behavior there is and how that translates into advertising.","Larry Page","Next question.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse","Larry different question on Google Fiber, if I may. It\u2019s now rolled out in a few regions around the country. Can you share with us some of your early learnings in terms of how consumer behavior changed once the connection speed stepped up materially in this new environment? And what kind of new services or products you think Google can rollout or how your existing services can change for the better? Thanks.","Larry Page","Thanks, Stephen. So I think again it\u2019s very early on Google Fiber. It\u2019s announced in several places I think really rolling out in Kansas City. I think one of the things that\u2019s unique about the Google Fiber offering is that your television service is available right through the data connection. So one big change in having a high-speed data connection is actually the entire kind of television experience, cable TV like experience comes straight through your data connection, through your gigabit connection. And people I think have been pretty excited about that experience being a great experience for watching television actually.","So our next question.","Operator","We'll go next to John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.","John Blackledge - Cowen and Company","Great. Thanks for the question. I wondered if you can review the content strategy at YouTube and the willingness to invest in areas like live sports, like the NFL and how the content strategy would play in the evolution of YouTube over time. Thank you.","Larry Page","Thank you, John, for the question. I think I'll also give this one to Nikesh.","Nikesh Arora","Well, again as we've always said that YouTube is an ecosystem which is a combination of great users, great advertisers and great content and we talk to content providers all the time because we understand that users come to YouTube so that they can enjoy both user-generated content, other forms of content both short form and long form. So we're pretty comfortable that we're making great sort of progress. The number of hours that people watch YouTube continues to go up, the amount of videos uploaded to YouTube continues to go up. And as Larry mentioned, we're seeing a lot of YouTube usage coming out of mobiles. So really our content strategy in YouTube is working. We're constantly talking to people about content all the time and so sure, we will talk to anybody who wants to talk about content. But for now we're happy with where we are. In the end our goal is to help make sure that our users have a good experience, that they get to see the right content on there and our advertisers are able to advertise on that platform.","John Blackledge - Cowen and Company","Thank you.","Larry Page","Our next question.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks. A bigger picture question for Larry and components of the question have been touched on in the call, but there has been a debate for some time about the Internet becoming more vertical and accelerated by the transition to mobile and if that could serve as a headwind for Google's business, yet your core revenue growth has been remarkably stable for several quarters now, above 20%. And Larry you've talked about this broad topic in prior calls, but I was just wondering if you can give an updated view of the landscape as it relates to your efforts to go deeper into the transition funnel to offset verticalization as well as if you could share your perception of Google's competitive position in a multi-device world versus the legacy desktop, laptop world? And then secondly, any timeline or thoughts that you can give on Project Loon in terms of it becoming a commercial offering? Thanks.","Larry Page","All right. Thanks, Scott, for the questions. So I think \u2013 so the first topic is pretty complex topic, I think we're very well positioned in mobile. I've said this before where we have the Android. I think we have tremendous services on Android. And we have obviously search and things that work across many different things. I'm tremendously excited about the funding. We have the potential to really improve people's experience as they move more into mobile and spend more time there and to make those experiences much more efficient and pleasurable and beautiful for those users. Often as I do things with third parties and one thing to keep in mind is we've done a lot of effort around the APIs on Android and we're working with top developers in and around Google Play as a marketplace for those developers. Those things are evolving all the time with the help of some users and help of those developers. So we have a lot of ideas there and a lot of work going on. So I'm actually very, very excited about that. I think we're tremendously well positioned to help them [indiscernible] move along and make users' experiences better and to improve our business from the developers' businesses. I think \u2013 even I find I'm spending most of my time now on mobile and not so much on the old desktop world, because I guess a lot of people are going to generally do over time. I think on Project Loon, again it's really early for that. So we announced because we had to, because people are seeing them and they're flying around and so on. But it's a small team, it's very exciting. We've been totally amazed by the positive reaction we've gotten across the world and from high speed and telcos and other people wanting to work with us, which is tremendous, we want to work with all of them. I think I found something important in trying to improve rural Internet access, which is something that if you're one of the significant number of people in a rural area or a place that doesn't have great Internet access now, it is something that really matters to your quality of life. So we're excited about that.","Patrick Pichette","We have time probably for two more questions, so why don't we jump in on the last two. Jamie?","Operator","We'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you taking the question. Larry, I just was wondering with advertisers having more choice of broad platforms to use for spending their digital ad dollars and in particular on mobile, I'm just wondering do you see a big acceleration in dollars moving from offline to online, do you see that pace accelerating over the next few years? And also how will Google continue to differentiate itself here?","Larry Page","Yes, I guess I'll give that to Nikesh. I'll just say we've always seen a lot of choices in advertising. We've always competed a while in that market and I think people are definitely getting more and more excited about moving dollars online. For us I think the measurability of it, the strength of the tools that are available and technologies to do that we just see as an amazing opportunity and I think people are more and more realizing them. Nikesh?","Nikesh Arora","Yes, to build on what Larry said I think he's right that we are expecting more and more dollars to move towards these platforms for a variety of reasons. One, there are more options for some more players in the market which are \u2013 that means they are all working hard towards the same goal of convincing advertisers and this is the place where the users are and this is where advertisers need to be. Also if you think about what's going on, it's as I said earlier in the context of YouTube, we are going to see more and more video coming on to the web and online mechanisms is more targetable and more addressable. In terms of our differentiation, if you look at what we've done over the last many years is we've actually worked in terms of trying to provide a comprehensive solution across all digital capability whether it's on Google, whether it's off Google, whether it's in our network, whether it's with us, whether it's with partners that are on the web, whether it's with mobile devices, whether it's on desktop devices, whether it's from display ads, search ads or video ads, if you look at it what we're trying to do is we're trying to make sure that when an advertiser wants to reach users, we can provide them a comprehensive solution that they can go ahead and advertise. And if you couple that with measurement which is what sort of makes online so much more compelling that if you are going to look at measurement, look at analytics around it, so advertisers get a lot more information. They have lot more options and of course in the end we want to make sure that we focus on very high quality ads. So if you combine all of those things, we think we can continue to be working towards providing them comprehensive solution and we work really hard with all the players in the ecosystem whether it's publishers, agencies or other media property owners, so we feel good about this.","Larry Page","Our next question.","Operator","We'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. A couple of things. First, on the rest of world acceleration, could you let us know if there was any platforms like mobile or products like maybe YouTube that really kind of kicked in the quarter that really help drive that, maybe it was Google Play? And then on Motorola it's now getting close to $1 billion run rate on annual losses. Could you remind us of the synergies that you're seeing with that and why you're encouraged by that and maybe when that could start to turn the other way? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","So clearly on international, not only is our kind of core search business performing very well, but also as you've seen other revenues which includes the Play platform is actually doing pretty well internationally. So those two are the big contributors for that one. As we stand on Motorola, I mean Larry mentioned it very well at the beginning of the call, right? It is still early days for us. I think that we have Dennis and the team have already made a huge transformation at Motorola. We have now great product quality, the Moto X, the first of the products that have come out and it's actually been very well received, a great product. So the team is now really working on building out marketing and distribution which is the kind of phase of it. So that's the mindset that we put in Motorola. This is not a this quarter or next quarter but much more \u2013 a more fundamental kind of optimistic and recent view of the company. So that's how we think of these issues. Thanks, Justin.","Larry Page","We may have time for one more question.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two things I wanted to ask about. First, just on Enhanced Campaigns, can you give us some sense of what it meant for overall spending in the quarter and then also how do you get advertisers to use the location and time of date, modifiers going forward. And then just on the U.S. business there was a [decel] there of about 500 basis points from last quarter? Patrick you mentioned the networks shifts there obviously, but was there anything else going on there?","Patrick Pichette","No, I mean, on your U.S. network it really is as you know there are changes in policies. They basically affect dramatically more our network and because of our network, think of AFS is really very heavy weighted to U.S., that\u2019s really what\u2019s been the main driver for that change. I will let Nikesh take the front end of the question.","Nikesh Arora","Yes, in terms of enhanced campaigns, I\u2019m not quite sure what do you mean by what it meant for overall spending in the quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Is it positive, I mean, was it incremental to revenue do you think in the quarter?","Nikesh Arora","Yes, we don\u2019t -- do we say it on the enhanced campaign, so we\u2019re not actually trying to quantify the effect, because we believe its part of your overall experience and its step in the right direction in terms of what you want to achieve. In terms of your question as it relates to location and time of day modifiers. I mean these are requests from advertisers, but to give you an example usually when a car rental company advertises when somebody is in airport, they\u2019re likely to get a higher click through rate and higher conversion than if somebody is searching for car rentals when they\u2019re sitting at the desktop. So the location can be used as a great modifier in terms of advertising, in terms of getting better conversion, that\u2019s just one example. We\u2019ve millions of examples like that where you can actually use location very effectively or time of day very effectively, the traditional example of when I\u2019m hungry you show me an ad more likely to click an ad that offers me restaurant choice or food choice than if I\u2019m not hungry and it\u2019s late at night. So there are different modifiers that allow us to pay different advertising. People shop more at lunch time, so there is a whole bunch of stuff that comes in when you start providing location and time of day modifiers. So I think it\u2019s good. Thank you.","Larry Page","I want to thank everyone for spending so much time with us and turn it over to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Just before we close the call, I think we\u2019ve great news to announce. I mean all of you that have worked with us, with the investor community group; you know that Willa Chalmers who is part of our IR team has been kind of missing in action for the last few weeks. I\u2019m just incredibly proud to announce that Jacob Allen Chalmers is now in the world and has arrived a couple of days ago, mom is doing incredibly well, so Willa is doing great too. So just to let you know that she has not disappeared, she is doing great, the whole family is. We are all ecstatic about it and it\u2019s another great kind of Googler addition for the family. So that\u2019s why Willa disappeared for a few weeks.","With that, I will turn it back to Larry to close the call.","Larry Page","Thank you all.","Patrick Pichette","Cheers. Jimmy off to you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do appreciate your participation and have a great day."],"1490":["Alphabet Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference call over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen West","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now, I\u2019ll quickly cover the safe harbor.","Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2017 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, and they are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.","During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz\/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you, Ellen.","We delivered another quarter with strong operating performance, reflecting our focus on building great experiences for users, advertisers and enterprise customers around the world. In aggregate, we had substantial revenue growth, up 26% year-on-year and up 23% in constant currency. Sites revenues continued to exhibit strong year-on-year momentum, benefiting from innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the way.","Our network adverting business maintained a healthy growth, led by AdMob and programmatic advertising. The businesses comprising other revenues, namely Cloud, Play and Hardware again had substantial growth.","Our outline for today\u2019s call is I\u2019ll begin with results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. There are two items to note in our earnings press release. First, we provided a table to highlight the impact of the European Commission fines on operating income, net income and EPS results in the second quarters of 2018 and 2017. Second, as discussed last quarter, our results are affected by the new accounting standard that changes the way companies account for equity security investments. This new standard continues to result in greater volatility in OI&E. I\u2019ll highlight the impact on particular line items, as I review the quarter. I will then review results for Google followed by Other Bets and will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.","Starting with the summary of Alphabet\u2019s consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $32.7 billion were up 26% year-over-year. We realized the positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $768 million or $665 million after the impact of our hedging program.","Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. You can see that our performance was strong again in all regions. U.S. revenues were $14.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.8 billion, up 26% year-over-year. In constant currency terms, EMEA grew 19%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and for British pound. APAC revenues were $5.1 billion, up 36% versus last year and up 34% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the Japanese yen and Korean won. Other Americas revenues were $1.8 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 34% in constant currency, reflecting strengthening of the dollar relative to the Brazilian real.","On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results, was $13.9 billion, up 34% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The key drivers were costs associated with our data centers and other operations, including depreciation, which continued to be affected by a reallocation of certain operating expenses and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, followed by hardware-related costs.","Operating expenses, including the impact of the EC fine, were $16 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fines, operating expenses were $10.9 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year. Once again, the biggest increase was in R&D expenses, reflecting our continued investment in technical talent. The growth in sales and marketing expenses reflects increases in sales and marketing headcount, primarily for Cloud, followed by advertising investments in Cloud and the Assistant.","G&A expense trends in the second quarter were affected by a number of factors, in particular, performance fees accrued in connection with the recognition of equity security gains, which were again partially offset by the reallocation of certain expenses from G&A, primarily the other cost of revenues.","Stock-based compensation totaled $2.4 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 89,058, up 4,008 from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.","Operating income was $2.8 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fines, operating income was $7.9 billion, up 15% versus last year, for an operating margin of 24%. Other income and expense was $1.4 billion, which includes $1.1 billion of gains in equity security investments. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.","Our effective tax rate was 24.2% for the second quarter, reflecting a sizable impact from the non-deductibility of the EC fine. Net income was $3.2 billion and earnings per diluted share were $4.54. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $8.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $11.75.","Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $5.5 billion, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $10.1 billion with free cash flow of $4.7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion.","Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $32.5 billion, up 25% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail. Google Sites revenues were $23.3 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with strong contributions from both YouTube and desktop search.","Network revenues were $4.8 billion, up 14% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of AdMob and programmatic. Other revenues for Google were $4.4 billion, up 37% year-over-year, fueled by Cloud, Play and Hardware.","We continue to provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses.","Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.4 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 26% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC. This quarter, we experienced year-on-year decline in the network TAC rate as a result of the favorable mix shift within our problematic business.","Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.3 billion for the quarter, up 21% year-over-year. Operating income was $9 billion, up 17% versus last year and the operating margins was 27.6%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $5.3 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction, and facilities.","Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. Other Bets revenues were $145 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $732 million for the second quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $10 million.","We\u2019re pleased with our progress across Other Bets. A couple of updates. Waymo expanded its partnership with Fiat Chrysler with the option to add up to 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its self-driving fleet. And lastly Waymo announced that it has driven more than 8 million fully autonomous miles with most of those on city streets.","A couple of weeks ago, X announced that Loon and Wing have graduated to become independent companies under Alphabet. Graduation from X signals that these companies have reached certain technical and business milestones and that their focus is shifting toward commercialization. And just last week, Loon indicated that it is partnering with Telkom Kenya to launch commercial service in regions of Kenya by early 2019.","Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer term outlook. First, with respect to revenues. We\u2019re pleased with the ongoing momentum in our advertising businesses. As discussed previously, we continue to identify new opportunities through innovation, including the benefits of applying machine learning to create more useful experiences for users and advertisers.","Looking ahead, our hardware business is seasonal, typically experiencing lower growth in the third quarter in anticipation of the launch of new products for the holiday season. Second, with respect to profitability. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is TAC. As we\u2019ve discussed for the past couple of quarters, we expected the pace of year-on-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue would slow after the first quarter of 2018, and you can see that clearly in our results of this quarter.","As frequently discussed, we do expect the sites TAC rate to continue to increase year-on-year, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, albeit at a more moderate pace relative to the year-on-year increases experienced over the past several quarters.","Within OpEx, we continue to take a disciplined approach to setting priorities as we invest for the long-term growth. The majority of our headcount growth continues to be in technical roles and engineering and product management. In terms of business areas, the largest number of headcount additions were in our cloud business with hires for engineering, sales and marketing.","As a reminder, headcount additions tend to be seasonally higher in Q3 because that is when we bring our new graduates. As I mentioned last quarter, regarding sales and marketing, we continue to expect expenses to be more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year to support the holiday season.","Another factor to consider in year-on-year comparisons next quarter is the timing of two expense items in Q3 last year. As we called out last year, there was a meaningful benefit in the third quarter of 2017 from the shift in timing of our annual equity refresh and also from the timing of sales and marketing spend which was more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.","For our Other Bets, we remain focused on making progress on a number of commercial opportunities across the business, while continuing to manage investment against achievement of key milestones.","Third, with respect to CapEx. As I discussed with you last quarter, our commitment to growth is evident in the ongoing trend in CapEx investment. We\u2019ve been investing meaningfully in search and ads consistent with the opportunities we see to benefit the user and advertiser experience. And we are investing in the additional compute power required to support growth in the number of YouTube users globally. We\u2019re also investing in new businesses that are growing at a rapid pace and have sizable compute needs, most notably Cloud. The investment pace also reflects the importance of machine learning across all of our products including search and ads. Although machine learning is more compute-intensive, it is increasingly core to businesses across Alphabet, and opens up the possibility of accelerated innovation in products and services. And keeping with our approach across Alphabet to invest thoughtfully for long-term value creation, we remain focused on both performance and cost effectiveness.","I will now turn the call over to Sundar.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks Ruth. It\u2019s been a busy few months at Google, and we showed a lot of what we are working on at events like Google Marketing Live, Brandcast, and of course our annual developer conference, Google I\/O. It was exciting to have millions of people join us in person and via live stream.","Tomorrow, I hope you\u2019ll tune in to Google Cloud Next where the great momentum and innovation in our cloud business will be fully on display. The common thread you\u2019ll hear on today\u2019s call is the benefit of machine learning and AI, and how it\u2019s improving our products and generating great results for our users and partners.","I also hope that everyone enjoyed the World Cup as much as I did. I know our French Googlers were very excited. I loved the competition and was extremely proud to see positive feedback about how useful Google Translate was for people who traveled to Russia. The app translates about 143 billion words a day. And during the World Cup, we saw a huge bump in volume.","In the simple moments when you\u2019re in an unfamiliar place or you don\u2019t know the language, Google is there to help with the right information at the right time. This is what we aspire to best at, and it\u2019s why billions of people continue to put their trust in our products.","Today, I\u2019ll start with how AI is enabling us to advance the mission of making information accessible and useful to everyone in new ways. Then, I\u2019ll share updates on our computing, video and advertising platforms which are helping our partners succeed and grow. And finally, I\u2019ll talk about our growing cloud business.","Let\u2019s begin with AI helping our mission. We revamped the Google News app in May to create reviews. It uses machine learning to highlight top stories organized for users, explore topics more deeply with articles from a range of clustered news sources. We believe in the need to deliver high-quality information and news to users, and to support the news industry as we do so.","The Google Assistant is another the great product based on machine learning. By the end of this year, it will be available in more than 30 languages and 80 countries. We have worked with partners to expand the number of smart devices that are now compatible with the Google Assistant like doorbells, dryers, refrigerators and more, and connect with more than 5,000 devices in the home.","At Google I\/O, we also highlighted how AI is improving Google Maps, including enhancing the experience with Assistant and AR features. Through our improvements in machine learning, we have seen a 25x increase in our ability to build maps algorithmically, and we have added 110 million algorithmically drawn buildings to Maps, since the beginning of this year. And with over 1 billion users, we\u2019re continuing to see tremendous growth in maps with especially strong growth in countries like Indonesia, India and Nigeria, each of which are growing over 50% year-on-year.","There are many more great AI powered features we rolled out this quarter including the new version of Gmail with Smart Compose, a new features that helps users craft emails faster. And Google Photos now suggests actions to help you brighten, share, rotate or archive a picture.","Next, our computing, video and advertising platforms. These platforms are providing real economic opportunities for developers, creators and publishers in every corner of the vault. Last year, I announced that in the three-year period from 2014 to 2016, we paid out over $15 billion in revenue to our creator, publisher and app developer partners in Europe, Middle East and Africa via AdSense, YouTube and Google Play. Our contribution is accelerating. In 2017 alone, we generated an additional $7 billion for these partners.","First, our computing platforms. 10 years ago, we launched the first Android phone with a simple idea to build a mobile platform that\u2019s free and open to everyone. Today, there are more than 24,000 devices at every price point from more than 1,300 different brands. The Android ecosystem supports thousands of phone makers and mobile network operators who build and sell Android devices. Millions of app developers around the world who have built their businesses of Android and billions of consumers who can now afford and use cutting-edge Android smartphones. This is all supported by a business model that encourages and enables this open ecosystem to thrive.","Continuing this momentum, at I\/O, we unveiled a plethora of new features throughout the Android platform, like battery saving features in Android P, new Google Assistant capabilities on Wear OS, the new Android model to help developers optimize for a variety of devices and form factors, as well as tools to help users understand and control how they are spending time on their device. Our investments in our computing platforms, as well as in AI and design are also helping us generate great momentum in our made by Google hardware business across Pixel, Home, Nest, Chromecast and more. We brought Google Home and Mini to Ireland, Australia, Spain and Mexico. Additionally, bringing the Nest and Google teams together is showing early results. The products can more seamlessly work together and our product development and go-to-market are benefiting from the new alignment. There is a lot more to come here in the next few months.","Second, our video platform, YouTube is growing tremendously. We launched our revamped YouTube Music service across 17 countries, and it\u2019s receiving great feedback from users and artists a lot. This quarter, YouTube rebranded its subscription service, YouTube Premium, featuring originals like our hit series Cobra Kai, which got 41 million views to first episode alone. While advertising on YouTube is an incredibly strong and growing source of income for creators, we are also investing in new ways for creators to generate revenue on the platform, including paid channel memberships, merchandise shelves on YouTube channels, and endorsement opportunities, through a company we acquired in 2016, FameBit. In fact, half of the creators that used FameBit in the first three months of 2018, doubled their YouTube revenue. ","And third, our advertising platforms which are firing on all cylinders, as we put the power of machine learning into marketers\u2019 hands.","At Google Marketing Live, we introduced our newly rebranded advertising products, our core product Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform which provides analytics and ad serving for large marketers and agencies, and Google Ad Manager, our monetization engine for publishers.","We also announced a new ad format powered by machine learning, called Responsive Search Ads. It automates the manual process of building text ads and optimizes them in real time to show the best performing ad for each search query. Advertisers also got a first look at local campaigns and smart campaigns. Local campaigns are designed exclusively to drive foot traffic to local businesses and smart campaigns are now the default for new SMB advertisers. Small business owners love the simplicity and the results.","This quarter, we announced shopping and commerce partnerships with leading global retailers like Carrefour, designed to give people the power to shop wherever and however they want. Carrefour is a great example of how we can partner deeply with companies, bringing our shopping and ads and cloud products together for them. They recently chose to migrate from Office to G Suite for their more than 160,000 employees and have selected us as their main cloud provider, based on our ability to support the Company\u2019s digital transformation.","Speaking of our efforts to help businesses succeed in the cloud, our cloud business has great momentum. It\u2019s a natural extension of our long time strength in computing, data centers and machine learning. We have developed these over many years and they power our own services in the cloud and are now helping others. This week\u2019s Google Cloud Next event will have more than 20,000 SMBs, up from over 2,000 at our Cloud Conference in 2016 with over 250 customers speaking.","I won\u2019t spoil any of the surprises, but I do want to call out Google Cloud\u2019s momentum. Success of our vertical strategy and customer centric approach was illustrated by key wins including Domino\u2019s Pizza, SoundCloud and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Target is migrating three areas of its business to Google Cloud platform. Financial institutions are increasingly turning to the cloud to modernize their systems, explore new business models and improve customer experiences.","New customers include Banco Ita\u00fa in Brazil. We also have our rapidly growing business for our specialized cloud AI services. AirAsia expanded its relationship with us to use machine learning and data analytics. We are seeing an acceleration in business adoption of Chromebooks, the most secure and cost efficient way for businesses to enable their employees to work in the cloud.","In Q2, unit sales of managed Chromebooks grew by more than 175% year-over-year. And we saw deployments at customers like Veolia. And to support our growing global customer base, we continue to invest in new cables, open new regions in Finland and Los Angeles, and announced the Zurich region. We now have 17 open regions with three more on the way.","Before I close, I want to give a quick shout out to the work that we are doing to build great specialized products for the next wave of people coming online for the first time in countries like India, Indonesia, Brazil and Nigeria, many of whom experience the web only through their mobile phone. This is a big area of focus for us. Through a great partnership with Indian Railways, and RailTel, we have hit our goal of enabling high-speed public Wi-Fi in 400 train stations across India. We\u2019ve also rolled out this Google Station model in Indonesia and Mexico with more to come soon.","And to help spur AI innovation in Africa, we recently announced the new Google AI research center in Ghana with the goal of bringing together top machine learning researchers and engineers to explore AI research and applications in Africa and beyond.","Of course, our commitment to help communities and people benefit from the digital economy, expense beyond the products that they use. Last month, as part of our broader growth Google effort, we expanded the Google IT Support Professional Certificate program to more than 25 community colleges in the U.S. This will give students an opportunity to learn skills needed to jump start their carriers in IT support.","I want to thank Googlers for their hard work which helps us create products that billions of people love and use every day.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.","Eric Sheridan","Thank you very much. Two questions if I can. Sundar, for you, following upon your comments, we\u2019ve seen all of these partnerships announced in the commerce space. I want to understand how those partnerships might evolve over the next couple of years? What Google brings on table for those partners, what it might do for the advertising services business as we thing long-term? And then, we\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions on Waymo, in the quarter. Is there any you can give us of some of the key investment milestones or how we should be thinking about capital allocated to the Waymo business in the coming years? Thanks so much.","Sundar Pichai","Great. On the commerce front, obviously, it\u2019s a natural sector I think for us to drive partnerships. We already have deep advertising relationships with many of these providers, increasingly. Shopping is an area where we are beginning to work together. And finally, I think cloud is another important way by which we can start working together. So, I do think we are seeing a lot of traction there. I gave the Carrefour example. We also announced strategic partnership and significant investment in JD.com, the second largest ecommerce company in China. Today, we are already, for example in Google Express we\u2019re partnering with over 100 merchants including national retailers like Walmart, Costco, Target, Walgreens and PetSmart. So, there is a lot of traction. I think we are building upon these relationships, trying to have more holistic conversations across the breadth of our offerings, and I think I see all being very synergistic.","Ruth Porat","And then, in terms of Waymo. We remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo. You\u2019ve seen us talk about our progress on a number of fronts. I think the main point is, it is still very early. But, in terms of our progress. So, 2018, the focus has been to launch the commercial rider program in Phoenix that we\u2019ve talked about, looking to do that by year-end. We do view that as a first step in building a more fully rolled out rider program in the future. And as we\u2019ve discussed on prior calls, we continue to trial the program in Phoenix with an emphasis on delivering a safe experience that delights users.","We\u2019ve also continued to build out our vehicle relationships. You saw announcements regarding FCA and Jaguar. We\u2019re expanding our testing to more states. We\u2019re also working on additional areas such as logistics and deliveries. We talked this past quarter about licensing the technology for personal use vehicles, and we\u2019re also focused on working with cities to help strengthen public transportation. More specifically, you\u2019re focused on CapEx. As I said, we\u2019re excited about the long-term opportunity but creation of a new market does take time. and then on the CapEx versus OpEx, the way it works is once the commercial program is up and running beyond what\u2019s viewed as more of a development or R&D phase than much of the investments or CapEx versus OpEx. And that\u2019s for car sensors and any other spend.","So, yes, we\u2019re excited. We do think it\u2019s really an important market, but it is still very early.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini","Great. I just had two questions. One, I was wondering if you could talk about what you\u2019ve seen thus far with the rollout of GDPR? Anything you could share with us, and just how that\u2019s played out versus your expectations at this point? And then, Sundar, as you mentioned, with Google Next upon us, and you\u2019re obviously -- you guys are talking very positively about the business. But, are there anymore stats you can share with us, even about the growth rates in G Suite or GCP or combined? And then, when we think about this business scaling over time, is there any reason to think that the pace of gross margin progression would be materially different than say Azure, AWS at similar revenue levels? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Heather. On GDPR, obviously something we\u2019ve been working on for a long time well over 18 months, but the rollout just happened towards the end of second quarter. So, it\u2019s a bit early to us to say anything. But for us, it\u2019s been super important to get it right, and we\u2019ve always been focused on user privacy. But, it\u2019s been a big change for a lot of our partners as well. And so, we are working closely with our partners and regulators and committed to doing it right, but it\u2019s too early to tell.","And on Google Next and Cloud, obviously the conference is tomorrow. So, I will hold for the announcements there. Couple of things, G Suite has definitely I think seen a lot of momentum, definitely have noticed in the -- now I think it can definitely serve the needs of a large enterprise, it\u2019s clear I gave the Carrefour for example. But increasingly, we are seeing big companies take on the migration. So, that\u2019s been four sure a positive development.","And on Cloud, I think we are investing for the long run. We are definitely seeing traction. A lot of our effort, from a product and technology standpoint, we are definitely there and differentiated. It\u2019s been a lot about investing in our go-to-market efforts. And as we do it, both developing our in-house strength but as well as partnering, those things are beginning to pay dividends. And hopefully, you\u2019ll hear more details at tomorrow\u2019s conference.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Brian Nowak","Thanks for taking my question there. I have two. The first one, the Google Assistant and the Hardware and Google Mini. I was curious, if you could just talk about sort of early learnings and differences in consumer behaviors, how they interact with those devices as opposed to mobile search and the phones? And they\u2019re always very focused on the long-term value proposition for users and advertisers. Maybe talk about the focus, and the hardware is long-term for users and advertisers. And Sundar, I appreciate your color on India and Indonesia and emerging markets. Talk about how you\u2019re strategically trying to position yourself for business potentially beyond advertising and payments or other areas in the countries, if you could, please?","Sundar Pichai","So on Google Assistant, obviously, we see Google Assistant as an important evolution. And obviously, it\u2019s early days, but it\u2019s already exciting to see. People definitely are pushing the boundaries of what they can do with these devices, and home control and automation is a good example of the kind of use case that\u2019s very, very different consumer behavior and which is why our assets in Nest et cetera end up battling over time. So, there is a lot more actions, people are trying to get things done, which is definitely areas we are focused on. But, I think it\u2019s important to understand that experience not just in the context Home and Home Mini, but also your core mobile experience, how it evolves on the phone and across the streams, you\u2019ll have in your life. So, we\u2019re taking the end-to-end user experience in mind, and that\u2019s where all the investments we have done over many, many years I think will come into play as the product evolves.","On your question about emerging markets, the user growth there is extraordinary to see. And we\u2019re seeing it across all our products. So, all our major products, products which have over a billion users each, they are all doing well in these markets. And so, that\u2019s where most of the growth is going to from. And so, it\u2019s an important area of focus. And we do see unique opportunities in these markets, which are different from the markets we are here in here in our more mature markets. You highlighted payments as a good example. And you\u2019ve seen us address that exclusively with Google Tez in India. And so, we will look to do more like that. And beyond just getting our products working better, we\u2019re going to opportunistic, we are investing in talent in these countries. And there is a lot of innovation, which is going to happen from these countries, both for their own markets and for the world beyond. And we want to be in a position to do that well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Doug Anmuth","Two, if I could. First, for Ruth. You talked about the higher cost, as you shift to machine learning driven business and then also your tech upgrade cycle around machine? Can you give us a sense of where you are in making those transitions and absorbing those investments from a cost perspective? And then, Sundar, mobile strength, clearly in the quarter. Can you just help us understand better how machine learning and AI or driving the stronger growth in mobile search and if there is any specific innovations or products you can point to that are driving that outsized growth? Thanks.","Ruth Porat","So, in terms of your first question and kind of machine learning, and I think you\u2019re kind of getting at cycle. You\u2019re really seeing it in two places, and part of that is they called out is with respect to OpEx. We\u2019re hiring and what you\u2019re seeing is the investments we\u2019re making across the board, it\u2019s ads, it\u2019s cloud, it\u2019s hardware, it\u2019s the Assistant, but this is also very much in machine learning and we are really proud of the team that we have and given the opportunity set that they are able to address. And I think you were getting more broadly at CapEx. The way we\u2019re focused on CapEx, as I said last quarter as well, we view this as it lands into our outlook for growth and the required additional compute capacity. And there are number of growth drivers there. And part is really to support growth that we are seeing in our search and ads business that\u2019s really consistent with the momentum that we\u2019ve commented on today and the exciting opportunities that we see to further enhance the user and advertiser experience. It\u2019s also for our newer businesses, as I noted in opening comments. And then very importantly, it reflects the importance of machine learning across our products including search and ads.","We\u2019ve talked about this in the past, machine learning is more compute intensive, but it also opens up more services and products across Alphabet, and that\u2019s what we are investing in to make sure that we\u2019ve got the capacity with best-in-class compute capacity. And so, the build is really machines, data centers and network infrastructure, and just to make sure and put a fine point on it, while we\u2019re ensuring that we\u2019re well positioned to support the growth we see. We do constantly remain focused on efficiency per unit of compute. We\u2019ve talked about that on many prior calls and are investing here for long-term value creation thoughtfully in order to be able to pursue the opportunities that we see ahead of us.","Sundar Pichai","And Doug, on your question on how is machine learning driving the mobile search experience. The key thing is, it\u2019s doing it at a deeper foundational level. We\u2019ve obviously used machine learning across the board, be it our ranking, actually understanding the intent, the context around the query, and getting you the right answer. I think, the experience is -- I mean, the improvements are happening continuously. And so, we are -- I would just say we are getting deeper in terms of what we are able to do.","In terms of specific innovations of products, it\u2019s super important to understand, I gave the Translate example earlier. While it may seem like a specific use case, it\u2019s obviously -- obviously, we can do translate well because of machine learning. But where it helps us is, we want Google to be the source you think of when you run into a problem. And the fact that the data shows that during the World Cup in Russia, our usage spiked up. To me it shows that when people are running into new things, new experiences, when they have questions on their mind, Google is what they are reaching out to. And I think the way we continue to do that well is by increasingly by using machine learning. So, that\u2019s the depth to which we think about this.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Anthony DiClemente","Thank you very much. First for Sundar. You talked about Android in your prepared remarks. In your blog post you said that you are concerned that the Android ruling from the EC sends a troubling signal in favor of proprietary systems over open platform. So, I wonder how are you thinking about the possible business impact from this Android ruling, specifically on tying the Play Store from Search and the Chrome browser. And does it in any way change your strategic approach for Android going forward? And then, for Ruth, on the theme of OpEx investment trends, if we isolate just the other revenue businesses, Cloud, Play and Hardware, all growth drivers, but clearly structurally different in terms of the competitive landscape and profitability. You said, most of the headcount additions are in Cloud, but would love to understand more about how you prioritize investment across Cloud, Play and Hardware, those three? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","On Android, I said in my blog post, Android has really worked well, I think globally for users for everyone in the ecosystem. You can clearly see there is robust competition. There is a lot of innovation, lower prices that has made Android possible at every price point. And so, I think overall, it\u2019s created more choice for everyone, not less. We are analyzing the decision, and I think it\u2019s too early to comment or speculate beyond what you\u2019ve already said. But we will -- we will always take a constructive approach. We\u2019ll appeal the Commission\u2019s decision and take the due process available to us. But, we are also looking forward to finding a solution above all that preserves the enormous benefits of Android to users and so on. So, there is small work to be done, and I think it will become clearer as we go along. But I\u2019m confident that we can find a way to make sure Android is available at scale to users, everyone.","Ruth Porat","And in terms of your question, on investment priorities, I think one of the most important points to underscore is that one of the biggest opportunities for investment, continues to be in our ads business where we are continuing to investment meaningfully, given the opportunity set that we see there. Sundar commented on some of them, as did I, looking at opportunities to enhance the user experience, to continue to improve tools for advertisers, and both of which extend the growth there. And that\u2019s for mobile and what we are increasingly seeing, is, as we focus on mobile, the benefits are across platform and help explain the growth we\u2019re seeing in desktop and YouTube. So, we are continuing to invest here. I don\u2019t want to leave with an answer, with the notion that the investment is just pointed to the new business sets.","And then, more specifically to your question, what we look at is the opportunity set, the -- each one of these is different. When we start with cloud, as Sundar commented, given the core capabilities that we are building upon, our technical infrastructure, security app, machine learning, analytical tools, our view is that we\u2019re addressing a rapidly growing market with the core pillars that are needed to win. And what has been the recurring theme that we\u2019ve talked about on these calls is the need to further build out our go to market capabilities and ensure that we\u2019ve got the functional requirements that enterprise customers deserver. So, it\u2019s really looking at the scale of the opportunity, the pace of investment that can be done effectively and therefore position us well.","Our hardware business continues to deliver significant growth, particularly with the sales as a home family of products, and you\u2019ve seen us invest there. We talked about the HTC acquisition last quarter because this is a scale business. And the ability to operate as effectively as possible underscores the types of investments we\u2019re making. Play continues to benefit from broad-based app strength, it\u2019s been a long standing strength of ours, and we\u2019re continuing to invest as needed there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney","Great, thanks. Two questions. It seems like your commentary on cloud is very positive. It seems like that\u2019s also what we\u2019re hearing from Microsoft. And my guess is from Amazon what they are seeing. Do you think we\u2019re just at a broad industry inflection point in terms of cloud adoption, and any thoughts as to why we\u2019re saying it now? And then, a question on advertising, there is just big bucket of ad spend called trade promotion spend, that\u2019s largely been offline I think, and it\u2019s almost as big maybe on a global basis as kind of traditional TV brand advertising. Any thoughts on that as an opportunity, whether there\u2019s an ability for that to really migrate heavily online and Google\u2019s ability to tap into those dollars? Thank you very much.","Sundar Pichai","On the first question on cloud. For sure, I do think there is an inflection point. And that\u2019s why, it feels far from zero-sum game. I think all the major players are definitely seeing traction. And to me, the reason is, typically when you look at enterprises, once you\u2019ve deployed and you have an architecture, you try and stay on it as long as you can in many, many cases, but this change is hard. But, this is a case in which the benefits are super clear. And over time, I think, there is a tremendous cost to your business of being on the wrong architecture, especially if you need to digitally transform yourself, thinking through the cloud architecture becomes an important way by which you are improving your business. So, I think at a foundational level, it\u2019s clearly there on everyone\u2019s mind. It\u2019s not just on CEOs are asking questions about cloud. Almost all businesses I deal with, I can clearly see the question is on the mind of their CEO. And so, I think it\u2019s important.","I also think it\u2019s going to be -- businesses are going to embrace multiple clouds over time too. So, I think not only is this early, but I think it is going to transform. And there is a lot of opportunity here. And our goal here is, it\u2019s something we view -- this is something we have built experience over 20 years. And we are thoughtfully gaining strengthen and committed to it for the very long term.","Ruth Porat","And then, in terms of kind of trends in advertising, to your question. We have talked about this quite a bit in the past, over 90% of commerce is still offline, and we do see a great opportunity for digital to play a bigger role in that and tap into our budgets, into other budgets that have traditionally been there. And so, we are quite focused on the advertising opportunities, as said. And the fact that ad budgets are offline, and as we focus on, these are opportunity and the tools for advertisers, we see view that as another opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Salmon","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Sundar, you mentioned in your prepared remarks or highlighted at least the launch of local campaigns at Marketing Live a couple of weeks ago. I recognize that\u2019s an initiative that will help drive demand across a number of Google properties. I\u2019m curious in particular about Maps, and with it being a product aimed at driving store visits, one would assume Maps would play an interesting part in that. And in the past, when we\u2019ve asked you about Maps, it was focused more on getting the user experience right. So, my question is, do you see local campaigns as something that drives a bit of incremental level of monetization of Maps.","Sundar Pichai","Okay. I think it\u2019s a good question. Local is an extraordinary use case in mobile. Local mobile searches are growing faster than mobile searches for us and have increased by almost 50% in the last year alone. And we are continuing to invest in building a local experience that benefits merchants, users and advertisers. And local campaigns is something new which we announced at Google Marketing Live a couple of weeks ago. It\u2019s a new campaign where if you are a local business, it\u2019s designed to drive foot traffic to you. You provide us with your budget, business locations and creatives, and we use machine learning to automatically optimize the ads to appear across our properties. Right? And along with that, you\u2019ve rightly noticed that we are beginning to experiment with new ad format, which we have had in beta, but we\u2019re pushing on them a bit more in Maps itself, both promoted places and place page ads.","So, these are important ways by which we are exploring the commercial opportunity around Maps. I\u2019ve always felt Maps is a tremendous asset we have. And we\u2019ve really focused on the user side of things. And we will continue to do so, because the growth is very, very high. So, we see a lot of headroom. But as that experience is -- as we get a better understand of it, we are developing our views on how we can bring monetization experiences. And so, these are all steps in that direction. But, we\u2019ll take it\u2019s slows and we\u2019ll continue to evolve it here.","Operator","And our question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open. ","Brent Thill","Ruth, the U.S. and Asia business has accelerated sequentially modestly, but Europe was down a touch. And I think there have been many questions around did GDPR have any impact, and Sundar said it was too early to call. But, is that just completely unrelated to what happened or maybe there is something else that\u2019s going on that resulted from the small downtick?","Ruth Porat","Yes. I mean, the way we look at it is, we\u2019re pleased with the strength in each of the regions at 19% year-on-year growth in EMEA and a fixed basis where we\u2019re pleased with the strength in the business. And as Sundar said, I think it\u2019s too early to comment on GDPR. We then hope that that\u2019s geographic split gives you better sense of what\u2019s kind of the dynamics in each of the various region. And as we both commented on, as long as you raise the regional question, I\u2019ve got to comment on APAC here, really pleased with the growth, 34% on a fixed FX basis and it underscores Sundar\u2019s comments about terrific products and rapidly growing markets, as well as the superb leadership group. Mobile strength is the key there as well, and we\u2019re very pleased about the breadth by the country that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re very focused on the region. So, as we look across the globe, pleased with the fact that it is -- all regions are contributing nicely.","Brent Thill","And a quick follow-up for Sundar. You mentioned on the cloud business that you\u2019re getting strong traction among some of the big fundamental institutions. One of the big questions we get is around the heavily regulated industries like healthcare, financial. It feels like you\u2019re starting to get better referenceability there. Are you happy with where you sit across the more heavily regulated industries now versus the tech-focused industries where you sit right now?","Sundar Pichai","Definitely, and I think that\u2019s where a lot of our investments have gone in, right, getting certifications needed, depending on the industry and building the features that you need. And that\u2019s clearly starting to have an impact, and both on GCP, but as well as G Suite. And so, we definitely are going to continue to build out our capabilities. And we\u2019ll be going after the opportunities in these areas very seriously.","Operator","And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Colin Sebastian","I have a couple, maybe first going back to the commerce theme. I wanted to ask about Shopping Actions and level of adoption you might be seeing with that formats. And more generally, what do you envision monetization for Google Assistant, if we should still expect to see more of a transactional event to that platform? And then on TAC, in wonder if it\u2019s worth adding a more color perhaps in the tiny or how much of the second quarter benefited from the moderation in growth in sites TAC just so we can get a better sense as to how to model that expense item over the next few quarters?","Sundar Pichai","Colin, on Google Assistant and Shopping Actions, there I do think it\u2019s been exciting to see the improvement there, but I still would like that experience they\u2019ve all a lot more before we play around with monetization. And in all of these areas, we always set a high bar to make sure the user experience is working well. You have seen us do that with Maps or something like that.","And I think today while we have taken promising steps with Shopping Actions for all of us to really work well and to delight users. I still feel we have some work ahead of us and that\u2019s what we are focused on. So, we will stay focused there, get the experience and then that will give us new avenues to monetize it. I've seen this with YouTube now, beyond ads we are experimenting with a lot of new formats, and the same thing here. So, I am pretty confident of our ability to do that well, if we get the user experience right.","Ruth Porat","And then in terms of TAC, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past TAC as a percentage of revenues is affected by quite a number of factors. The main point is that we do continue to expect the TAC rate to increase on a year-on-year basis. And the primary reason is when we talked about really in the past that it\u2019s the underlying shift to mobile which carries higher TACs than desktop. So, on a year-on-year basis, that\u2019s the trend that you are really seeing as the ongoing strength in mobile.","Over the past four quarters, changes in partnership agreements have also been a driver of increases in the TAC rate and then there are host of other factors that we\u2019ve talked about they can have an impact in any quarter like device mix or partner mix or mix of organic and pay distribution points.","And so, as we called out last quarter, we did expect the pace of year-on-year growth in the sites TAC rate to slow beginning in this quarter, the second quarter, and you can clearly see that in the data. And as we\u2019ve repeatedly said, it is most effective to focus on year-on-year changes given the significance of this shift to mobile and mobile growth. And so variations in quarter-on-quarter move are less instructive.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Michael Nathanson","One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, firstly. You went through a lot of your initiatives in your opening comments, but didn\u2019t mention Verily. So can you talk a bit about what the bottlenecks are then to be solved by you or your clients before you can scale the Verily opportunity? And then for Ruth, you\u2019ve been clear on the CapEx ramp is due to you are investing ahead of growth. What is usual timeframe do you think, do you see where those investments to pay off? And what factors would make the CapEx to sale ratio start growing even faster from here? Those were my questions.","Sundar Pichai","Broadly, Verily is clearly set up us an other bet, and they are doing really important work on healthcare, if we look at the recent progress on their diabetes monitoring and so on. So they\u2019re in deep work and they have a lot more talk about. Across healthcare, we see a big opportunity for both Google and Alphabet. It\u2019s a vertical, which is very important for Cloud. And we are obviously helping a lot of healthcare partners across their needs. And Verily is definitely doing a very specialized solutions in this area. And we\u2019ll have a lot more to say on all of this over the course of time.","Ruth Porat","And then, with respect to CapEx, look, I think, our view is that what you are saying here is an aggressive piece of investment, given our outlook for growth. And as I said the required additional Compute capacity, we are quite focused on the kind of full resource utilization across businesses. If I go back to couple of years when we incorporated stock-based compensation into the way we are talking about the businesses, I made the point that that is helpful, both externally and internally, and looking at resource utilization, the same is clearly true of CapEx. And we are quite focused on long-term value creation, focused on ensuring that we\u2019re pursuing attractive opportunities in a prudent, appropriate way to capture the opportunity while making sure that we\u2019re looking at the full again resource requirement. So, at this point, that\u2019s an interesting way of framing the question, how does it grow even faster from here. We\u2019re quite focused on this thing, an aggressive piece and an appropriate one, given the opportunities that we see, and it is a class data centers, machines and network infrastructure as I said.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Justin Post","Thank you. I just want to get into website growth. First, maybe you can help us a little bit understand strength in mobile search. Are there new any ad formats or ad changes? You mentioned local, anything to call out there? And then, just wondering, given the YouTube controversies last year, did YouTube accelerate this quarter? And what are some of the big content areas that you are investing in? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","So, in terms of sites revenue, I think, our view is ongoing strength reflects our focus on improving the user experience and enhancing tools for advertisers. And both Sundar and I have spoken about them. We\u2019ve got an intense focus on innovation that we\u2019ve discussed previously that\u2019s enabled us to deliver over a 100 innovations each quarter. And really exciting area is the benefit of machine learning. It\u2019s a valuable driver of our growth, not only enhancing experiences for users but the tools that we talked about for advertisers and for app developers, certainly helping them find the right audience, to be able to optimize campaigns at scale, to deliver more relevant and higher quality ads. Sundar talked about a number of them. The Google Marketing Live, we\u2019ve really highlighted what we\u2019re seeing there and the benefits, whether we\u2019re talking about responsive search ads or local campaigns, smart shopping campaigns, another great example is universal app campaigns. So, across the board. And again, I made this comment previously about the benefit we\u2019re seeing on mobile is extending to the growth opportunities across platforms.","Sundar Pichai","Yes. And I\u2019d add that a good way to think about it is, today, there is a lot of complexity you need to deal with to have advertiser, and increasingly we are using machine learning to do all the hard work and get them to focus on the business problem they are trying to solve. And that turns out to be a big driver overall.","On YouTube, we definitely are continuing to see great product momentum, it\u2019s the user adoption and interest and our metrics are very strong, continues to grow and the growth is global. And we see it across many, many verticals. And overall, we\u2019ve invested a lot in making sure we are delivering the content responsibly. And it\u2019s been a big area of focus across Google. We are investing a lot in people to review the content that\u2019s going, improving the policies. And again, using machine learning to make all of this work better. And I think people are noticing it including our advertisers and they\u2019re engaging with the platform more. So, I would say overall, there is a lot of momentum there. And I\u2019m excited about it.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks. ","Ellen West","Great. Thanks everyone for joining us today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen West - Alphabet, Inc","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. While you've been waiting for the call to start, you've been listening to Ingrid Michaelson. In just a decade, she has released six albums, five of which have charted. The song you just heard, Celebrate, is from her latest release titled, \"It Doesn't Have To Make Sense\". Please check out her YouTube channel.","Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2015, filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them.","During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website, located at abc.xyz\/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Thank you. Our revenue of $26.1 billion in the fourth quarter underscores the continued excellent performance of our businesses globally. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenue grew 24% in constant currency versus 4Q 2015, notwithstanding a challenging year-on-year comparison. Advertising revenue growth was driven by Mobile Search with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from hardware, Play and Cloud.","Our outline for today's call is first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I'll focus on year-over-year changes in our results. You can find quarterly comparisons in the earnings release. Second, I'll review the results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with a summary of the full-year results and our outlook. Sundar will then review our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.","Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenue was $26.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $202 million or $15 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenue grew 24% year-over-year.","Alphabet revenues by geography highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenue was up 24% year-over-year to $12.7 billion. U.K. revenue was up 7% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, reflecting the continued weakness of the British pound relative to last year. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 21% year-over-year.","Rest of world revenue was up 24% versus last year to $11.3 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year-over-year. GAAP other cost of revenues was $5.8 billion, up 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $5.5 billion, up 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses; specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers including depreciation and content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube as well as hardware.","The impact of our Q4 hardware launches is reflected in both revenues and cost of revenues. However, it's important to note the cost of revenues was also affected by approximately $320 million of one-time charges related to equipment and another adjustments, which were unrelated to hardware.","GAAP operating expenses were $8.8 billion in the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $7.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Year-on-year comparisons in part reflect the impact of the expenses from project milestones and Other Bets in 4Q 2015 that we discussed last year. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last year. The operating margin was 25%. Non-GAAP operating income was $8.5 billion, up 24% versus last year. The operating margin was 33%. Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion, up 29% year-over-year. Headcount at the end of the quarter was just over 72,000, up 2,100 people from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers to support growth in priority areas such as Cloud including the addition of employees from our Apigee acquisition.","Other income and expense was $218 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 22% for the fourth quarter reflecting the geographic mix of earnings and certain discrete items affecting our U.S. rate. Our effective tax rate for the full year 2016 was 19%. Net income was $5.3 billion on a GAAP basis and $6.6 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.56 on a GAAP basis and $9.36 on a non-GAAP basis.","Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $3.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.4 billion with free cash flow of $6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $86.3 billion of which approximately $52 billion or 61% is held overseas.","Let me now turn to our segment financial results starting with the Google segment. Revenue was $25.8 billion, up 22% year-over-year which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $18 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Year-on-year growth reflects strength in Mobile Search. YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView including buying on DoubleClick Bid Manager. Network revenue was $4.4 billion, up 7% year-on-year reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob offset by the traditional network businesses.","Other revenue for Google was $3.4 billion, up 62% year-over-year with strong performance from each of hardware, Play and Cloud. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.","Let me remind you that these metrics are affected by currency movements. Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.8 billion or 22% of total advertising revenue and up 20% year-over-year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue, as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenue, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely Mobile Search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate driven by the shift to mobile which was partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites which carries lower TAC. Operating income excluding SBC was $9.5 billion, up 19% versus last year for an operating margin of 37%. Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 29% year-over-year.","Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $7.9 billion, up 17% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.","Turning to Other Bets, I'll cover results for the full year 2016 because it's most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon as discussed previously. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release.","For the full year 2016, Other Bets revenue was $809 million, up 82% versus 2015, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss excluding SBC was $2.9 billion for the full year 2016, a slight decline from 2015. Including the impact of SBC, the operating loss was $3.6 billion for the full year, an increase of 4% over 2015.","Other Bets accrued CapEx was $1.4 billion for the full year 2016, up 63% over 2015. Before I move to my conclusion, I'll quickly cover some specific changes to our past practices.","First, we are making changes to our non-GAAP reporting. SBC has always been an important part of how we reward our employees in a way that aligns their interests with those of all shareholders. Although it's not a cash expense, we consider it to be a real cost of running our business because SBC is critical to our ability to attract and retain the best talent in the world. Starting with our first quarter results for 2017, we will no longer regularly exclude stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results. Noncash stock-based compensation will continue to be reported on our cash flow statement, but we will no longer be providing a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures that reflects SBC and related tax benefits.","Second, we are shifting the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle for employees to the first quarter of every year. The next full year equity refresh will occur in the first quarter of 2018. Because the last full employee equity refresh occurred in the third quarter of 2016, we are providing employees with a one-time half grant in the first quarter of 2017. Overall, total SBC for 2017 will be roughly the same as it would have been had we maintained a Q3 refresh cycle. However, given the shift in refresh timing, there will not be the historical seasonal increase in SBC in Q3 and Q4. We do not plan any changes to our senior executives' equity refresh, which occurs every two years with an excellent plan for 2018.","Third, to hedge our non-U.S. dollar earnings, we are moving from using options-only to using primarily forwards. We believe they will be a more effective way to hedge earnings. We intend to continue to use options selectively.","We continue to believe that constant currency revenue growth provides the best insight into underlying trends by isolating the impact of currency movements on revenue. We will continue to provide constant currency results for consolidated revenues, as well as for revenues by geography. This will give you a view into the effects of currency movements on our revenue.","Turning now to our full-year 2016 performance and outlook. 2016 was simply a great year for us. Our extraordinarily talented employees worked very hard and successfully for our users around the globe. That commitment is reflected in the company's exceptional financial results. For the full year 2016, consolidated revenue grew 20% and excluding the impact of currency movements grew 24%. GAAP operating income was up 23%. This performance is a testament to the ongoing innovation that is driving our success in Mobile Search, YouTube and programmatic advertising, each of which we believe has only begun to scratch the surface. We remain excited about the sizable opportunities that have not yet been tapped.","Alongside these businesses, we are focused on growing additional revenue streams within Google over the medium and long-term. In 2016, our other revenue line grew 41% on a full year basis, reflecting the growth in our Play, hardware and Cloud businesses. We see tremendous potential ahead for these businesses, as well as in the continued development of non-advertising revenue streams for YouTube. We're investing in our Cloud and hardware businesses as well as our newer non-ad revenue sources for YouTube in order to accelerate their progress as major revenue drivers for Google in the next several years. We're also investing significantly in the machine learning capabilities and next-generation computing infrastructure that will propel Google's growth over the longer-term.","For our Other Bets, we continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate to their individual execution paths. A couple of our recent announcements demonstrate our approach here.","First, in December, Waymo graduated into a standalone business within Other Bets. We did this because Waymo achieved agreed thresholds on the path to commercialization in its technical and business model. Waymo continues to excel at safety, has begun putting its new Chrysler Pacifica minivans on the road and is continuing to drive down hardware costs.","Nest delivered an outstanding performance this holiday season with sales of key products more than doubling over the two weeks including Black Friday and Cyber Monday.","And just this morning, Verily announced that Temasek has agreed to invest $800 million for a minority stake in the company. Temasek's extensive experience with life sciences and healthcare companies and deep understanding of Asian markets make it a valuable long-term partner for Verily.","The internal transparency we've provided to our business leaders across the Other Bets and Google is helping us to allocate resources more thoughtfully across the opportunities that we see. We remain committed to managing for long-term revenue and EPS growth for dollars rather than margin targets, while exercising careful stewardship over the amounts and pace of investment.","I will now turn the call over to Sundar.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Thanks, Ruth. 2016 was a great year for Google, and 2017 is shaping up to be even more exciting. This quarter was about the business firing on all cylinders and terrific progress across Google's newer areas of investment.","Today, I'm going to talk about three things. First, the key trend powering Google today, machine learning and how it's improving our products and creating lots of opportunities. In particular, how it's underpinning our core mission of providing access to information for everyone, especially via the Google Assistant, which is off to a great start.","Second, I want to talk about three of our biggest bets, YouTube, Cloud and hardware, where we are making great progress. And third, I'll discuss the great trends we are seeing across the platforms; our vibrant computing platforms, Android, Chrome and Daydream, strong momentum in Google Play, as well as our thriving advertising platform.","First, machine learning and access to information. As I've shared before, computing is moving from a mobile-first to AI-first with more universal ambient and intelligent computing that you can interact with naturally, all made smarter by the progress we are making with machine learning. 2016 was the year that this became central to who we are as a company and the products that we built. We had more than 350 launches powered by machine learning across areas like search, maps, messaging and Google Play.","You've heard lots of these examples; easier e-mail replies and inbox, better YouTube recommendations, the incredible cameras on our Pixel phones, and smarter bidding for advertisers in AdWords.","A centerpiece of our machine learning efforts is the Google Assistant which allows users to have a natural conversation with Google to help them get things done across their experience. It's off to a great start. You can easily ask it to navigate home, tell you about your schedule for the day, or even play trivia. We reached a milestone last month with our announcement of the Assistant developer platform called Actions on Google. It gives developers like Uber, SongPop and Headspace the opportunity to build conversation actions for Google Home, and we'll expand it even further this year. The Assistant is baked into our smart messaging app, Allo, which we expanded this quarter in languages like Hindi, Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese.","This quarter, using neural machine translation, we have improved our translation ability more in one single leap than all our improvements over the last 10 years combined. We'll be rolling neural machine translation out across to more than 100 languages available in Google Translate in 2017 and also for all of our Cloud customers through the Google Cloud Translation API.","And Google Photos, which as you know has machine learning at its heart, continues to grow in popularity. Last quarter, we launched PhotoScan, which helps you digitize all of those old printed photos that are probably stored in a shoebox in your closet, to keep them safe, organized and shareable. In February, we are hosting a summit where our machine learning team and other experts will discuss the future of the TensorFlow open-source initiative and share some of their latest demos.","Now, I want to spend some time talking about three big bets, YouTube, Cloud and hardware. First, YouTube, which remains the premier destination for online video globally and is seeing tremendous growth. At the heart of YouTube's success is its booming community of creators. Every single day, over 1,000 creators reached the milestone of having 1,000 channel subscribers. We are focused on two main areas of investment. First, creating the best video experience that's fast, personalized, searchable, and that just works. We have rolled out many new features to the platform like 360-degree videos, mobile live streams, and support for videos and virtual reality. In regions with limited connectivity, we introduced YouTube Go, which has transparency and control of data usage.","Second, we are focused on delivering content that gives fans exactly what they want through offerings like YouTube Music, YouTube Kids and YouTube Red. We have 27 originals, pairing some of the most popular YouTube creators with the biggest directors and producers in Hollywood. One of our new originals called This Is Everything, Gigi Gorgeous about the courageous journey of a transgender YouTube star, officially premiered at Sundance just a few days ago. The popularity of this original content has been successful in driving new subscribers and retaining existing ones, and we'll do more in 2017.","Second, our Cloud business is on a terrific upswing. In 2016, we made huge strides building out our product offerings across all areas of Google Cloud Platform or GCP. We routinely hear from customers that we have now moved well beyond table stakes, and we have truly differentiated offerings in four key areas: data analytics and machine learning, security and privacy, tools for application development, and the ability to create connected business platforms, leveraging our recent acquisition of Apigee. Our product advancements across all of GCP, in addition to our increased focus on how we work with the enterprise customers, have enabled us to accelerate growth with new Fortune 2000 customers while also inspiring our current customers to substantially expand their use of GCP.","We have also enjoyed strong growth with G Suite, our cloud-based collaboration and productivity applications. G Suite achieved a significant new customer milestone last quarter. More than 3 million paying businesses are now using G Suite to collaborate smartly and securely in the cloud. Our increased success with enterprise customers relates to the unparalleled security and data protection we can provide by offering an entirely cloud-based solution that enables an extremely strong level of production. For both GCP and G Suite, expanding our partner ecosystem continues to be a big focus. And last quarter, the team announced new alliances including Intel, Improbable, Slack, Pivotal and Red Hat. Our customers and partners are appreciating Google Cloud's dramatically accelerated pace of product rollout, as well as our responsiveness to both their needs and aspirations. We look forward to showcasing customers, partners and all of Google Cloud at our next annual Next user conference in March.","Third, hardware. We introduced a new family of beautiful hardware devices in October that are made by Google, led by Google Home and our Pixel phone, which featured a Google Assistant built in. We are thrilled with the reception as well as the really happy customers we saw over the holiday season. In particular, Google Home was a very popular present that many people opened on Christmas morning. We are committed to this for the long-term as a great way to bring a beautiful seamless Google experience to people. The early signs are promising and you can expect us to see us expand our offerings thoughtfully. We will also continue working closely with our ecosystem partners to create the best experiences for our users.","So those are three of our biggest bets. We are also continuing to push the platforms that are powering our business and our partners' businesses. First, our computing platforms; and second, our advertising platforms. Building powerful open platforms has always been core to Google and our platforms like Android, Chrome and Daydream are creating more innovation, more choice for users and more opportunities for partners. This was on full display at the CES show. There we saw partners like NVIDIA and AirTV introduce new media players based on Android TV. And Casio and New Balance shared their latest Android Wear smartwatches.","We also worked closely with Samsung on a new generation of Chromebooks called the Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus, which are getting great buzz. And in VR, we recently worked with partners like Huawei and ASUS and others to introduce even more new Daydream-ready devices. CES is just a start and there's a lot more coming from our great partners across these platforms in 2017, and we'll continue working hand-in-hand with them to provide the best experiences for our users.","We're also investing in ways to help developers succeed using our platforms. Last week, we announced that we are acquiring the Fabric mobile app development platform. This will work alongside our Firebase platform to help developers build better apps and grow their businesses. Since we launched Firebase at I\/O, developers have created over 1 million Firebase projects. That's incredible momentum. Google Play helps bring our platforms to life on mobile and beyond, and it's experiencing great momentum. As a piece of trivia, do you know what 2016's top movie was on Google Play? I'll provide the answer in a second.","Play had a great quarter with continued growth in our top markets, as well as in emerging markets where user spend grew by more than 70% year-over-year in countries like India, Mexico, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. As the content hub across our growing platforms, the Play team is working hard to help users get the most out of their devices through apps, games and premium content.","In Q4, the Play Store launched on Daydream, Android apps became available on Chromebooks and we announced that the Play Store will soon be coming to Android Wear. The platform is also benefiting significantly from machine learning. We recently introduced a new Google Play music experience that makes music streaming smarter and easier to use with better recommendations and playlists. And the answer to my trivia question, the top movie in 2016 was Deadpool.","Lastly, I quickly touch on the highlights across our growing advertising businesses. I'm so pleased with the terrific partnerships we have continued to grow this year. We work incredibly closely and deeply with agencies, marketers and publishers worldwide. These relationships owe a lot to the hard work of our fantastic business teams around the world. Our mobile properties like Search, YouTube, Maps, and Google Play are where people turn when they are actively engaged. They are the primetime in the mobile era.","We had another successful holiday season where we saw two clear trends. First, this was the year that mobile shopping went truly mainstream, with shoppers using phones as their door to the store to locate nearby retailers, find promotions and comparison-shopped. We recently introduced promoted places in Google Maps, helping advertisers stand out with branded location icons, showing promotions and live updates of popular times right when someone's looking for it.","Gap Inc is one example of a company that understands the importance of connecting with consumers on mobile devices. In December, they increased their U.S. mobile search ad spend with us; and as a result, they saw about four times the mapped mobile traffic to their U.S. e-commerce sites compared to December of last year.","Second, we saw this season that measurement really matters, and advertisers want reliable ways of understanding where their sales and traffic are coming from and how their campaigns are working. We saw increased use of our popular store visits technology over the holiday shopping season, helping businesses understand how online ads bring customers into their physical stores. In less than two years, store visits have helped advertisers measure over 3 billion store visits globally.","Now, turning to our thriving video ads business, led by YouTube. Marketers are seeing terrific success here. Air France used YouTube's TrueView video ads in order to reach valuable business travelers and new customers around the world. By showing engaging videos, highlighting the unique experiences of Air France, they saw more than 100 million views throughout the campaign.","Turner Sports partnered with YouTube and DoubleClick for NBA opening night to try a new way to reach fans for the start of the season. We help them deliver real-time video ads with behind the scenes pregame footage uploaded immediately into a YouTube TrueView ad campaign. Thanks to the campaign, they were able to reach 19 million more people across the web with 17% left in ad recall. Speaking of DoubleClick, many news publishers who are using our Accelerated Mobile Pages are now plugging into our Ad Exchange to drive revenue. We are thrilled that most publishers are getting higher click-through rates and effective CPMs with the AMP pages.","Before I end, I want to highlight one area that I'm really proud of that Google is truly leading the way. As you know, our data centers from Oklahoma to Chile, to Finland enable our services to be blazing fast and they are what make it possible for Google Photos to offer unlimited storage. But to do all this, they use lots of energy. In 2012, we set the long-term goal to reach 100% renewable energy for our operations. In 2015, we procured enough renewable energy to cover 44% of our total and in 2016 we increased it to more than 50%. I'm really proud that we'll reach 100% renewable energy for global operations in 2017. This is great for the environment and with renewable energy costs declining, it's a huge win for our business results too.","With that, I want to thank the Googlers around the world who help make this another exciting quarter. Over to you, Ruth.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. I had a question for Sundar. I was wondering, I wanted to focus on the cloud business. When we speak with CIOs about GCP, they highlight in many cases the need for Google to improve upon its enterprise sales strategy. I'm just wondering if you could share with us the changes you've been making in that organization and the goals that you have for the cloud business for 2017.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Thanks, Heather. As I said in my opening remarks, I do think we have seen tremendous momentum at our partnerships team and how we are approaching. There are a lot of new alliances which I talked about. So now we have teams dedicated to partnering with GSIs and we have a team focused on technology partnerships too. On the GSI front, we announced a new alliance with Accenture last September to create industry solutions for a number of industries including retail. So for me, I think, overall, everywhere I look at we are establishing a world-class enterprise team. Partnerships has been a big focus and I've seen progress there.","I think as I said in my remarks, overall, 2017 I expect to have a lot of momentum because we have moved well beyond the table stakes. Now, we are really competing on areas which we think we have differentiation. I talked about data analytics and machine learning, security and so on. So I think we are well-positioned. The momentum when we look at the numbers internally and as well as the traction we see in competitive situations, I definitely think we are going to have a great year and hopefully in the next conference coming up, Diane and team will share a lot more details.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe first for Sundar. Now that you have this breadth of device ecosystem out there into the marketplace, wanted to know if we get a little bit more color around what your learnings are about the adoption of the device ecosystem, how you're thinking about the go-to-market strategy over the medium to long-term and how we might see sort of an evolution across operating systems? And if I can, maybe one for Ruth, you called out a one-time charge in \u2013 or one-time impact on the number in the quarter. I wanted to get a little more granularity about what went into that one-time expense so we could just sort of factor that into the financials. Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Hey, Eric. I'm assuming when you said the device ecosystem you're talking about how our platforms are working at scale. The thing which I get excited about is computing is increasingly moving rather than just one device which is a dedicated computing device to being there for users in their context and you'll see computing increasingly embedded in many things, and we have a comprehensive strategy. We do want \u2013 we invest in it for the long run. We're improving our computing experiences with machine learning. We expect to be there for users across a device ecosystem, and we're also building things like Google Play to work across all of this so that users can have one coherent experience. I think we see great momentum both across our partner ecosystem, as well as pushing the cutting edge of the experience which is what we strive to do with our own hardware devices. And so I think the end-to-end strategy is working well for us.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","And in terms of, you noted, the one-time item, there are really two that I'm actually going to call out. One was in cost of revenues, I noted that equipment costs were elevated by some one-time charges, and so there was some pressure there. And then the other item that I noted was with respect to our tax rate. I noted that there was slightly elevated tax rate this quarter. It's always affected by the geographic mix of results but we did have a discrete item that affected the U.S. tax rate to make that clear.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Two questions, please. Again, Ruth, on that $320 million one-time charge, is there any more detail you can provide on that? It seems like a relatively sizable amount.","And then, Sundar, if you could talk a little bit about Voice Search, particularly in the home and in the car, and the importance of getting devices out in the marketplace? And the challenge I'll throw to you is, it looks to me like Google devices are being outsold ten-to-one or something like that in most \u2013 in a lot of homes, and it's immaterial now, but it could see in five years that there's is a new Voice Search interaction interface and it's not Google in the home. That could be a real challenge for the company. Thank you.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","So, on the first one trying to be helpful in giving you dimension and impact on cost of sales, but really not much more to add there. I think the other point is that you're thinking about the hardware business. It was gross margin positive. There were just some other variables in there.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","And, Mark, on Voice Search, we are really excited about it. I think it's a very natural way for users to interact. We think it will be one mode. Users will have many different base by which they interact with computing. And for voice, as you pointed out, we expect voice to work across many different contexts. So we are thinking about it across phones, homes, TVs, cars, and trying to drive that ecosystem that way, and we want Google to be there for users when they need it. And even with Google Home, we just launched it in Q4. We had a very strong quarter there, and we are going to invest a lot in it over 2017. It's very early days. When I look at what it would take to Voice Search well, our years of progress we have done in areas like natural language processing comes into play, and I think there's a lot of work ahead to make all of this work well for users. And this is the core area where we've invested in for the very long term, and so I feel very comfortable about how this will play out in the future.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Ruth, you commented on YouTube and addressed some of the non-advertising revenue streams. I was just hoping you could elaborate there a little bit what the goals would be there for your users.","And then just to follow up on Mark's question on Voice Search, I understand, Sundar, it's early, but how do you think about the challenges and opportunities from a monetization perspective in Voice? Thanks.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","So on the first question in terms of YouTube, Sundar elaborated on my opening comments. We're really pleased with the ongoing strength we have there. We talked about on prior calls. It's largely driven by Video, primarily TrueView with a strong contribution from DoubleClick Bid Manager, and we are continuing to invest significantly in the business given the importance of supporting the ecosystem of content creators through partner payments, marketing, YouTube Originals, YouTube Spaces. We're broadening the platform. We're investing in the requisite infrastructure given machines and bandwidth required, and Sundar elaborated on some of the upside we see there on the non-ad side.","And really the point I was trying to stress consistent with Sundar's comments is, we've got the non-ads momentum here on the YouTube side, and we're also seeing tremendous momentum with cloud, which we're excited about, and the hardware and investing behind those. So those continue to build out the revenue streams as we're looking in the near to medium to long term.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","And, Doug, I mean, just like Mark's question on Voice Search, I would encourage you to think about it as from a user standpoint, they are looking for information, looking to get things done. The voice queries are one part of the total journey they are on. So when we think about something like the Google Assistant, we think about it as an ongoing conversation with our users across different contexts. So they may ask a question on voice, later when they pick up their phone, they want continuity, so we think of this as an end-to-end thing. And all of this means users engage more with us, more with computing and look for more information, and I think the trends we see are positive. So we think about it from a long-term perspective, and so I see more opportunity than challenge when I think about Voice Search.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Another one on YouTube, if I could. Would it be possible to get any sort of metrics around YouTube Red and how the subscription business has been progressing, realizing you're not going to be providing that every quarter but that you do occasionally give us some sort of benchmarks in the market? Thanks so much.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Well, at this point, we've launched in five countries. We're pleased with the early success and it's still early days, it takes a while to build a subscription business here. And I'll pass it to Sundar for additional commentary.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Look, I mean, I think \u2013 I would think about it as, we are investing a lot in developing this premium experience in a way of YouTube Brand, YouTube Music, and we do offer it across Google Play Music as well. You will see us invest more, more countries, more original content, and we'll bring together the experiences we have over the course of this year. So it's even more compelling for users. But we are seeing tractions with the rate of signups. We're not disclosing specific numbers, but I'm excited at the progress there.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, just to go back to YouTube, I appreciate the color around the content. I'd be curious to hear about how you think philosophically about partnering with more premium content players to maybe drive even higher engagement and an even better YouTube experience.","And then the second one, if you kind of step back in your Mobile Search business and the verticals, the innovation you've had at retail and travel with Shopping and Hotel Finder, I guess I'd be curious to hear about where you see the biggest potential for more improvements in certain verticals for an even more relevant and higher search result experience over the next years. Thanks.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","On your first question, look, I mean, we think of YouTube again as an ecosystem. We are trying to connect creators with users, form a community. And so, we work hard to bring more premium content. We already work with TV networks and their individual shows, whether it's a late-night show like James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, afternoon shows like Ellen, sports programming like NBA and NFL. For example, sports is one of the most popular verticals. We have hundreds of sports partnership in place, and so we'll continue to invest that way and drive the premium content there.","On the second one, we do look at the end-to-end experience, look at what are the kinds of tasks which users are trying to get done. Mobile raises the bar if you want to provide those deeper experiences for users. And so, I generally think local is a big area. We have strong assets there with Maps, and so we think about how we can improve the local experience a lot more for users. So for example, within local areas like dining, we work closely with our partners to make that better. So we get it at a pretty granular level and we try to hit all the areas. And so, I think you'll see progress in all these areas over the next few years.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open.","Anthony DiClemente, CFA - Nomura Instinet","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Yeah, just on YouTube, I'd love to hear about the pricing and then also about AdMob (44:47). So, is there anything you could highlight on ad format? And specifically, we noticed that recently you're enabling marketers to target YouTube ads based on search, and so I just want to hear about that strategy. And maybe relatedly, the recently announced non-skippable YouTube ads format. Would love to kind of hear about that. Thanks for taking my questions.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Look, overall, I would say there's been a \u2013 been very pleased with how the team has been driving innovation in ad formats and ad experiences. I think video advertising is in its very early days. We see whenever we (45:32) innovation phase, and advertiser response to all these new formats has been really positive. So for example a bumper ads are six second video format that we launched. It's already being used by thousands of accounts, including major brands like Universal Pictures and Netflix.","On your question around how we think about the experience across screens, it's really important to understand users consume YouTube across screens, and so they experience consistent experience. And similarly, from an advertising standpoint, we want that to be thoughtful for users, more relevant across screens as well. And so that's the context in which we do this. We give users control over that experience. But I do think as part of these changes, advertisers can get more detailed insights from their YouTube campaigns across devices so they can better understand the impact of their marketing campaigns. So I think it's early days, but I think it's the right direction, and I think we will see good traction from it.","Anthony DiClemente, CFA - Nomura Instinet","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of Moffett. Your line is now open.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, just picking on the YouTube questions, there was a report that YouTube and CBS had agreed on an agreement to distribute CBS on YouTube. Can you talk a bit if that has actually happened? And if so, what's the opportunity to partner with networks and how will that evolve over time?","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Look, I can't comment on any specific discussions, but I said a little bit earlier we are constantly working with partners across these areas. We work very closely with TV networks on their individual shows. It's a big part of the YouTube experience. And so you will see us work hard to make these partnerships deeper and bring more content to our users. So maybe I'll leave it at that.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then for Ruth, you mentioned programmatic drove the network members' revenue growth this quarter. If you look at fourth quarter this year and last year, there seems to be an acceleration in Q4 and then it comes back. I wonder what's happening seasonally to that revenue line that drives fourth quarter up so much.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Well, as we've talked about on prior calls, there are obviously a number of businesses within the network line, and a number of things went right this quarter. I wouldn't extrapolate from it. As you know, there can be some seasonality, and Q1 is typically lower than the fourth quarter.","I think the main point is that the programmatic business continues to be a strong contributor with significant growth reflecting the ongoing advertiser adoption just given the overall efficiency of programmatic and improved targeting and the benefit of inventory growth. And so the story, it's pretty much unchanged. We continue to see the growth in programmatic offset by declines in the more traditional businesses. And when you're looking at the quarter-over-quarter, we are continuing to see things like the impact of policy changes and timing of product launches. But I just think that there were a number of things that went well this quarter. Q3 was a bit lighter so that's been flatter quarter-over-quarter comparison, but I wouldn't extrapolate from this.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Wondering, Sundar, if you can just give us a sense on the Pixel phone hardware opportunity to kind of build direct mobile distribution and capture hardware margin, and how you think about that versus the potential disruption that having your own handset at a bigger scale could cause in the Android ecosystem? Do you think this is something that could get meaningful market share without disrupting the ecosystem?","And then a second follow-up related to this would be on the Pixel phones with Google Assistant having been built uniquely into the core of the experience, is there anything you're learning as the usage of that increases? Is it driving a step-function, increasing engagement with the hardware\/software integration? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Look, I mean, we are in the early days. I think it's really important when you work on a platform you have to drive it forward as we've always done by putting out the state-of-the-art and I think it especially gets important in the vision we have for computing where users are going to use it across many different contexts. And so to do that end-to-end experience, it spans devices. So I think it's important for us to work at the intersection of hardware, software and services and so that's how we think about it. And I think we invest a lot more in our ecosystem and I mentioned earlier, I'm incredibly excited at the lineup we have for this year from our partners. So we do both and we are very thoughtful about it. I think the scale at which we are doing it shows it's working and I'm confident we'll be able to strike that balance well.","In terms of Google Assistant on the Pixel along with how search works, I think definitely it gives us a way to iterate and move faster and make sure it's working better for users. Our thesis is that as we make it easier for users to have Google at their fingertips across what they are doing and including many modes whether they are typing or asking Google a question, we find that it overall benefits. And so it will be a long-term trend but I think our earlier studies (51:44) show that our intuition is right there and so we'll continue approaching it that way.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. So, Sundar, you called out Google Play growth in emerging markets in your prepared remarks. So I thought from a revenue size standpoint it would be one of the big bets you would highlight but \u2013 so I'm wondering how you view your own Instant Apps as well as the products or their operators to let consumers try apps either in a messenger product or on an HTML5 environment? Do these innovations present an opportunity or a challenge for you at the Play franchise?","And secondarily, it seems that the recurring theme in your prepared remarks is how AI is making the consumer products better. Is there anything you can share with us as to how it may be making monetization better? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","So, on Google Play, for me what makes it work well is just with the vision of computing we have been talking about how it works across contexts. You need an ecosystem. You need an apps and services ecosystem to work cohesively across all of this and that's what I like about how we are approaching Google Play and you saw us this quarter \u2013 see Google Play work beyond Android phones. They're coming to Chromebooks. They work in Daydream, they work in Android Wear and so it's an end-to-end thing which works well. And that's the most important thing so that as a user, you know whether you're engaging with a game or a TV show that you can reliably get it across your computing experiences. And we'll adapt and I think we will drive innovation simply to go where what's right for users and developers and so be it Instant Apps or driving better HTML5 experiences. We invest in all that and I think we'll move it all forward.","On your second question about how machine learning and AI is improving our monetization, it definitely, I mean, just like we had many, many launches last year which involve machine learning being incorporated across Google including our monetization products. Our monetization teams at Google have always been at the cutting edge of what I would call as machine learning techniques from early days on. And so they are doing it. It is early days now but I think we already have really new insights and so we'll bake it in over the course of the year.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Sena of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI","Hi. Just maybe another question on YouTube. Can you expound a decision this quarter to remove third-party cookie and Pixel activity? It looks as though you're favoring something much more identity-based and maybe you could just think through the \u2013 or explain a bit about the impetus there and maybe the trade-offs for marketers, that would be great. Thank you very much.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","I spoke about it a bit earlier, but I think it's important that we evolve all of this from a user-centric standpoint, and users have an identity, they have preferences. And so for example, think about it from a user standpoint. If they don't like one particular ad or they don't want to see an ad from a particular advertiser. They want it to work across their experience, across their cross-device experience. So we think about it that way, and so we are working towards a long-term experience that's right for users and which I think will make sense for advertisers reaching users too. So I think we are evolving it jointly and thoughtfully, giving users control. And I think that's the right way to approach it over time.","Kenneth Sena - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I'd like to ask first a question about ad coverage and click rates. Maybe just your thoughts on potential to increase ad coverage now that you have a fourth link. Is there still room to help ad clicks with coverage increases? And just as you think out to this year, how do you feel about the innovation pipeline in ads? Do you think there's a lot more you can still do in Search?","And then two, housekeeping for you, Ruth. Maybe you could just let us know what kind of equipment was written off so we can think about how recurring that might be, and any comment on the buyback activity in the quarter? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","On our monetization efforts, our teams always have been very thoughtful about planning not just for the short-term but planning for the long-term. We don't start the year thinking our plan is to increase ad coverage or something like that, right? We have many experiments in the pipeline. We see how user behavior is evolving and in conjunction with that, we evolve our ad experience. So for example, as people use mobile, scroll more, it's to track the user behavior changes, and we adapt to that in a very, very disciplined way.","So last year, you saw us maybe increase coverage in a certain way. For example, in desktop, we removed ads on the right-hand side, and so we take a very holistic approach to these things. For me, I do think we have a lot of headroom ahead. I still look at where most of transactions happen and how that secular transformation is underway, and so I think we see we have a lot more headroom left. And Ruth, I'll pass...","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","And \u2013 yeah, in terms of your second question, really not much more to add on the first part. In terms of the buyback, we weren't able to commence it in the fourth quarter due to trading restrictions but we do look forward to getting back into the market.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time.","Ellen West - Alphabet, Inc","Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.

This call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ellen West, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen West","Thank you, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Patrick Pichette and Omid Kordestani.","As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations page for the latest Company news and updates. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.","Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected [Audio Gap] this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.","Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and, as applicable, other special items. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Ellen. As some of you may know, we have a new leader in our Investor Relations team at Google. Her name is Ellen West. That\u2019s the great voice you just heard a minute ago, a second ago. Ellen is a long term Googler who joined us in 2007. Although she is here with us today in Mountain View, she is actually based out of New York and that will give us a bit more footprint on the East Coast as well. So, Ellen, welcome to the team.","With that, let\u2019s dive into the details of Google\u2019s financial performance for Q3. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 20% year-over-year to $16.5 billion and was up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would have been 19% year-over-year. Google sites revenue was also up 20% year-over-year to $11.3 billion and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter driven by the strength in our mobile search.","Network revenue was up 9% year-over-year at $3.4 billion and was flat quarter-over-quarter driven by improved year-over-year growth in the AdMob and the Ad Exchange businesses. Finally, Google\u2019s other revenue grew a healthy 50% year-over-year to $1.8 billion and was up 15% quarter-over-quarter, this driven by year-over-year growth mainly from the Play Store but also complemented by an increase in licensing revenue.","Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter, up 17% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPCs were down only 2% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. And without currency fluctuations, aggregate cost per click would have been down 1%, and in fact, up 1% quarter-over-quarter.","As we began to do in our last earnings call, we continue to disclose paid clicks and cost per click changes by property type as well in addition to the aggregate number. So to that end, Google sites paid clicks were up 24% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Google sites CPC were down 4% year-over-year and down 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our network paid clicks were up 2% year-over-year and down 4% quarter-over-quarter and network CPCs were down 4% year-over-year but up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors including geographic mix, device mix, property mix as well as ongoing products and policy changes.","Turning to geographic performance now, we saw solid performance in the U.S. as well as in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you will see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., UK and the rest of the world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. U.S. revenue was up 15% year-on-year to $7 billion. The UK was up 17% year-over-year to 1.6 billion and in fixed FX terms, the UK grew 10% year-over-year. In the UK, growth was impacted by a combination of factors this quarter including platform and property mix as well as tough comps from year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth rates for a number of reasons including for example weather. Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the UK was up 26% year-over-year to $7.9 billion. This accounted for 48% of total revenue which includes a 10 million benefit from our hedging program. In fixed FX terms in fact the rest of the world also grew 26% year-over-year, very healthy.","Let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion or 23% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was 2.8 billion in Q3 which excludes stock-based compensation and also a non-cash impairment charge of 378 million related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired as part of our Motorola Mobility purchase. Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled 5 billion, again excluding SBC. And as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit [Audio Gap] and our non-GAAP operating margin were 32% in Q3.","Headcount was up roughly 3,000 in Q3. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 55,000 full time employees. And please note that the headcount does include still approximately 3,500 full time employees from the Motorola business. In the past year, we continued to attract and hire the best talent from the best colleges and universities from all around the world. Continuing our past trend, graduate starts are much more heavily concentrated in Q3, which is part of why you are seeing the significant bump in headcount with the majority being tech hires, I want to kind of emphasize.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22% for Q3 and which includes the impact of the impairment charge that I mentioned earlier which is a non-deductible for income tax purposes.","Let me turn now to cash management. OI&E or other income and expenses was $133 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. And for more details on OI&E, please do refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was 2.4 billion. In this quarter the majority of the CapEx was related to our data center construction, production equipment and real estate purchases, in that order. It's important to remember that our infrastructure supports all of our products, whether they are core products like or Search or Ads, Maps or YouTube, but in addition to fueling our growth products like Photos and Hangouts, Google For Work and the Cloud platform. If you look at our data center announcements over the last four quarters, you will also see that we've been really busy with both groundbreakings and expansion all around the world including Finland, Taiwan, Singapore, recently announced Netherlands in addition to our ongoing investments in the U.S. In total, our free cash flow was then 3.6 billion.","And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. The team continues to work hard and we look forward to seeing them join the Lenovo team soon. Motorola had a great Q3, with strong user reviews for products like the Moto X, Moto 360 and Moto Hint, clearly demonstrating the impressive momentum of the company.","So there you have it. Strong results with continued strong growth in both revenue and profits and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities including the usual Android, Chromes and YouTube but also Google For Work and Cloud to name a few.","Before I hand things over to Omid, I'd like to share with you some great news. I am really thrilled to announce that Omid is now officially Google's Chief Business Officer and this on a permanent basis. All of us at Google couldn't be happier to see Omid at his post running our business organization once again. And with that, I will turn it over to him for more details on our performance in the quarter. And after his remarks as usual, we will have Jamie open up the lines for your questions. Here you go, Omid.","Omid Kordestani","Thank you very much, Patrick. And hello, everyone. I am Omid Kordestani. I am happy to be back at my new old job and thank you for joining us this afternoon. I joined Google back in 1999 to help get our business off the ground and led our business operations until 2009. Since then I have served as an advisor for Larry and outside Google actively helped many entrepreneurs. I am thrilled to be back at Google leading our global business again.","We continue to have the same boundless energy and endless curiosity we've always had as a company and we are as focused as ever in our mission of making information useful and accessible to everyone. Case in point, we are really excited about this week's Android Lollipop launch. This is our largest release on Android ever with over 5,000 APIs for developers. It adds new features including better notifications, battery life and security and introduces a refreshed, consistent visual style. And alongside the new devices Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player, consumers in India who bought the recently announced Android One will get the update to the latest software at the same time.","Now I\u2019ll do a quick walk through of the business highlights from Q3. As usual, we\u2019ll give an overview of these four areas, performance and brand advertising, our advertising platforms and our emerging non-ads businesses. Let\u2019s start with performance advertising, the core of our business.","People want the right information at the right time. They don\u2019t want to have to think about whether it\u2019s on the web or in an app. We\u2019ve learned this first hand as a developer of many services, Maps, YouTube, Gmail that also are some of the world\u2019s most popular mobile apps. With that in mind, we have a simple goal with performance ads: help marketers connect with customers at the right moment to drive measurable results.","Our partners have driven hundreds of millions of app downloads with AdMob on our click to download formats. But most mobile apps are downloaded, used once and eventually deleted. So we launched new features to help advertisers re-engage with users post download. For example, advertisers can now deep link from their search ads directly into their mobile apps. To succeed with multi-screen marketing, advertisers also need modern measurement tools so they can understand when their ads drive phone calls from customers resulting conversions on other devices or lead to store visits and purchases. Last October we announced estimated total conversions, our effort to help marketers better measure the value of their multi-screen advertising. We\u2019ve worked to continue developing this product and launched cost device measurement for display ads. Clients have already found that mobile display campaigns drive 15% more conversions than they had previously measured.","Let\u2019s shift gears to talk about our shopping efforts. [Audio Gap] with performance ads we are directly connecting people with [Audio Gap] and then enabling them to buy and have them delivered. We keep making improvements to our products to help retailers. Keeping inventory organized and up to date is a constant challenge for retailers. We help them manage this issue by completing the transition of product listing ads to our shopping campaigns platform.","And finally, people often want to find stores near them to make a purchase in person. We\u2019ve long had local inventory ads that enabled merchants to show customers this information in the U.S. and we launched these in the UK, France, Germany, Japan and Australia last quarter. In summary, the core of our business, performance advertising, continues to deliver great results.","Let\u2019s move on now to our brand business. Our objective is clear here, make digital the best possible canvas for creative and effective brand-building campaigns. First let\u2019s talk about YouTube. Any conversation about great advertising starts with great content. On YouTube, stars produce amazing content that our users love from Bethany Mota to Smosh to Mental Floss. Earlier this year we launched Google Preferred to help connect brands with premium ad inventory on our most popular YouTube channels. Since then we have secured upfront commitments from top media agencies. We\u2019re just getting started with YouTube and its potential. We\u2019ve sold out the majority of our U.S. Google Preferred offering which represents among the top 5% of popular channels inventory on YouTube. And as a result of terrific brand events in Germany, France, UK and Australia, we\u2019re seeing tremendous interest from local agency partners around the world.","Last quarter we also saw some great progress in our brand efforts beyond YouTube. We launched new ad formats customized for mobile screens. We also announced an expansion of YouTube\u2019s TrueView ads into AdMob's network of more than 650,000 mobile apps. Everyday our teams work to develop both the products and terrific partner relationships that enable us to tackle any digital marketing challenge across multiple channels together. With encouragement from Google and YouTube, ABC executed a digital first marketing plan for their new fall TV line up. Their effort included custom five second-ads for TrueView and collaborations with homegrown YouTube stars. We\u2019re very excited about the new deal with Mondelez and Starcom MediaVest. This global agreement will focus on video and display and is Mondelez\u2019s largest digital media deal ever.","Next let\u2019s take a look at one of the fastest growing parts of digital advertising world, programmatic platforms for agencies and publishers. For many years now our goal has been to provide world class technology for brands, agencies and publishers who power their ads businesses. Today our DoubleClick suite is used by all major agencies and we\u2019re particularly focused on multi-screen and video. DoubleClick Bid Manager is the go-to tool for marketers and agencies to navigate the rapidly growing programmatic advertising space. It\u2019s doubled in size year-over-year by impression volume and we really love the progress we see here. For publishers, we help them make money from their content via our publisher tools from our Ads Exchange to customized private exchanges which complement our core offerings. This quarter we signed new private advertising exchange deals with publishers like Fox TV and Edmunds. This helps publishers generate revenue from premium ad space. We have nearly doubled the number of private [Audio Gap] our system year-over-year.","Finally, we\u2019re seeing remarkable momentum in our newer non-ads businesses, whether it\u2019s Play, Hardware or Google For Work, we continue to see strong growth and we\u2019re thrilled to be a platform for our partners' successes as well. Google Play\u2019s growth continues to impress. It\u2019s a linchpin of the amazing Android ecosystem. We brought Play Music to 17 new countries, bringing the total to 45 and our expansion continues. Today, Play Movies is available in 93 countries and Play Books is available in 61 countries.","On the hardware front, just yesterday, we unveiled three fantastic new Nexus devices, Nexus 6 phone, Nexus 9 tablet and Nexus [Audio Gap] and Android powered streaming media player. This quarter we worked with HP, Toshiba and Acer to introduce five new Chromebook devices and teamed up with Asus, LG, Motorola, Samsung and Sony to help launch new Android Wear devices. We\u2019re also selling Chromebook in six new countries. They\u2019re now available in 31 countries around the world. And we sold more than 1 million Chromebooks for education this quarter, even more than last quarter.","Chromecast celebrated its first birthday this past quarter. It\u2019s been a smashing success. Users have hit the cast button more than 400 million times since it launched to enjoy their favorite sports, music, premium movies and TV shows. In September, we added even more content to Chromecast, including Disney content. And we were so proud to launch Android One, an effort to make high quality low cost smartphones available to as many people as possible. We started in India and we\u2019ll be expanding to other countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines in the coming months.","For businesses, what was called Google Enterprise, is now simply Google for Work. This business has great traction. In addition to the tremendous growth in our Apps business, we have more than 1,800 signups for Google Drive for Work every week. Plus there are almost 250 billion active Google Drive users, including consumer, education and business users.","We continue to invest in our growing Cloud platform business, helping developers realize the promise of cloud computing by providing affordable on-demand access to world-class technology. We recently announced Google Cloud Platform for Startups and offer up to $100,000 in credits to enable the best and brightest startups to use Google\u2019s Cloud platform.","Sony Music recently built an interactive app in less than three weeks using App Engine to engage fans tuning into One Direction Day, an eight-hour YouTube livestream featuring the band, one of the largest ever YouTube music live streams.","Lastly, our marketing team had a great quarter as well. Google My Business helped more small businesses get online. And our Art, Copy & Code project showed advertisers the creative potential of digital marketing. And from the annual Google Science Fair to more recent campaigns showcasing amazing content on Play, YouTube stars and the power of the Google App, the magic of Google was on prominent display.","All told, it was another terrific quarter at Google, continued momentum in our core business and exciting innovation in new areas. Kudos to the Googlers around the world who made it all happen.","I\u2019ll turn it over to Patrick to wrap up and start our Q&A.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Omid. So Jamie, if you want to give us the instructions then we\u2019ll get going on the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric Sheridan - UBS","Thanks for taking the questions. So, first one, maybe with the announcement that you\u2019re expanding Google Shopping Express into other cities and rebranding it and new retailers are coming on, [Audio Gap] what you saw on those first few cities to think about extending it further into the other cities. And what you might be hearing from feedback from retailers about adopting the platform because a few also dropped off the platform at the same time? Just wanted to get a little bit better color about how that was developing and how you were going to go forward with it. Thanks.","Omid Kordestani","Thank you very much, Eric. So, we're really trying to learn a lot here. Innovation is a messy process and especially with Google Express here. There is a lot of understanding that we need to have on improving efficiency in the logistics process, trying to find price points that shoppers find attractive. And our goal is really to help the over 35 merchant partners succeed and reach their customers. And I'm a user of it and I am really impressed by how much time it saves. I see the cars running around the city around me. And I think our goal is really to take it a step at a time and see the success, understand the logistical operations, how much it costs us to do this and can we deliver this basically in a successful way.","Patrick Pichette","Just Eric, just a couple of kind of additional points; one is, clearly we\u2019ve announced this week three other cities. So if you go back to the fundamental premise of [Audio Gap] which is the first thing was would people show up and want this product. It\u2019s very clear people want this product. The second one was -- and that\u2019s why we\u2019re expanding the product.","The second question then is, we've had a lot of questions about monetization, and we've announced this week we're taking real actions on the monetization service, both including commissions on each transaction from merchants, but also service fees that were announced as well. So from that perspective, we kind of think of it as now we're in Phase II of this product where according to our business plan we continue to kind of look for the barriers, the milestones, and then when we hit those milestones, we with enthusiasm keep on going. All this to say, it is nevertheless a scale business, so working on efficiencies, working on all of the issues that are related to logistics continues to be a big focus of ours.","And on the partners, I mean we're really thrilled to have the partners we have. You can expect as we kind of grow through this that we have a few coming in, a few coming out, but overall very, very pleased with the trajectory there. And so I think you should see the announcements of this week as this kind of sign of optimism and momentum in it.","Thank you so much for your question, Eric.","Eric Sheridan - UBS","Great.","Patrick Pichette","Jamie, let's go to our next question.","Operator","And we'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I'm wondering if you can help us at all segregate the search business from other items in Google website and just give us your view on the health of the search business. And then comment a little bit on the paid click deceleration, what's driving that? And do you even see that as an important metric? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","So I'll take that. The two points is, one, look, we don't give the breakdown of the Google sites, but actually it's pretty healthy on all dimensions. I think that from that perspective, search is going well. And all of the other dimensions of our sites have actually doing pretty well, and that's what you see in our kind of 20% year-over-year just for sites growth. So from that perspective, I think that we're pretty happy on that front.","On the CPC issue, it's pretty simple. I mean we really had -- again, you have to think of the CPC and the volume as one basket that actually delivers. So monetization overall is still very strong. We're very happy with the monetization, Jamie. And if we have in one quarter kind of movements between one and the other, that's just basically the continued experimentation and the impact of all the factors that I usually talk about.","So from that perspective, there was nothing noteworthy to kind of mention this quarter. We're very happy with the trends in both cases.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Jamie. Jamie, we'll go to our next question. Sorry, Justin, I meant. Jamie, we'll go to our next question.","Operator","And we'll go next to [Stephen Zhu] (ph) with Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, thanks. So I think in the past you've talked about the opportunity cost of not being there for the user when they're trying to access your products and services as a rationale for making investments. So is there any data you can share on your newest users in the emerging markets who are going straight to mobile? Is it safe to assume that consumption from these new users are running at a pretty similar growth trajectory with what you've seen historically on a desktop and as well as your established markets? Or is their engagement with all of your products more intense?","And is there anything you can say in terms of what areas of your business are seeing the more intense level of investments? Is it more your consumer-focused initiatives or more your enterprise-focused cloud initiatives? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","So a couple points there, and then if Omid has additional comments. One is clearly emerging businesses -- emerging markets are just fundamentally different than the more developed markets, if you think of a country like Indonesia or India where people go straight to mobile. And so in that context, there's clearly a lot of differences between those markets and how they're evolving compared to what would have been 10 years ago the UK or the U.S. So from that perspective, I think that -- and that's why you see us launch things like Android One, right? When you have 1 billion -- just under 2 billion people around the world that have already smartphones, the vast majority of the population looks for things online. So these kind of initiatives that we're launching is the most important piece.","From an investment at Google, we're investing -- without giving you all the details, we're clearly investing in our core business. It remains the focus of our activities. But if you look across -- as Omid mentioned, he mentioned the Cloud business, the Google For Work business, all of these other areas, the Play business, the Hardware business, these are all areas where we're investing and we're investing with enthusiasm with each their own specific business case, each of them are actually looking for what is their growth and profitability models and we just monitor them pretty tightly.","Okay, so you're welcome. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","Hey, Patrick, in describing the Google search strength, you said you saw particular strength in mobile search. Could you elaborate?","Patrick Pichette","Yeah. I mean, look, it's very clear that mobile is still a big part of our growth. And we're very pleased about it. I mean, it's -- but when we talk about mobile, I think there's a couple things. One is you have to continue to look at both the growth in volume and the growth in pricing. So these are long-term trends that we're seeing. The CPCs and the clicks, they can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. It just happens that we've made some changes this quarter that improved the mobile pricing while impacting the lower quality clicks and that's what you see a bit reflected in our numbers.","And again, and I wouldn't -- just as an overall statement, remember to everybody that I wouldn't attribute the aggregate CPC movement [Audio Gap] mobile, because there's still a full factor mix that -- as I talked in my remarks about geography and about our product changes. And so all this actually makes a big factor as well. So that's what we've seen in the strength in mobile, but we're still very pleased with the momentum.","Thanks, Mark. Jamie, we'll go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank","Thanks, guys. I just had two questions, first on the UK and then second on mobile payments. So the UK growth, looks like it's dropping off pretty hard on an ex-FX basis, either one-year or two-year growth rates. So I think this is an economy that folks generally think is supposed to be holding up pretty well. So can you talk about what you're seeing in the UK? You had mentioned weather and a few other things, but a little bit more color on what's going on with the ad market in the UK.","And then mobile payments, that's an area that's getting a lot of attention lately. Can you just give us an update on where the Google Wallet team stands and what kind of traction you're seeing in terms of user adoption and maybe how you plan on addressing merchant payments kind of outside of in-app or things from the app store? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","So, Ross, why don't I take the first question and then Omid will give you the answer on the second?","As we talk about the UK, a couple points are worth note. One is, the UK contributed roughly 10% of our total revenue this quarter, and that's been the same for kind of the past many quarters. And in fact, if you go back years, it will still be in the same range. So there's nothing kind of fundamental that -- it's worth noting that it's still a pretty good market with decent growth.","The issue of deceleration this quarter specifically, on platform -- I mean I mentioned a number of elements, right? So platform mix, we do see [Audio Gap] of desktop, tablet searches having a greater impact in UK than anywhere else that we see in our network of countries. On property mix, remember we talked about this also on prior calls. AFS as a business has much bigger part of our both UK and U.S. business, so it will skew to those geographies. And so those are kind of some of the elements.","And as I mentioned, year-over-year comps were difficult. And then if you have a great summer in terms of weather or bad summer in weather, it can have some real impact on the growth rates as well. So it's a combination of a number of factors that the UK has driven our performance, but still pretty pleased. But I won't -- that's really what's going on there.","In terms of the payments, I'll let Omid give you an update there.","Omid Kordestani","Hi, Ross. I think our goal here is really achieving mass merchant adoption, so the availability of these NFC devices is about that and also making it easier for consumers to replace their wallets with their smartphones hopefully more and more over time. So reducing friction in everyday shopping experiences is how we approach it and the focus on the user and we're really developing a fully functional payment system.","So, as you may know, users can send money today to friends through Gmail using the Wallet app. We have loyalty and gift cards that can be stored in the Wallet app. The Buy with Google button makes it possible for users to make purchases very quickly with two clicks. So, again, it's this two-fronted focus on merchant adoption and removing the friction for users.","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Ross. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie","Omid, after many years of waiting for television budgets to shift online, it appears to be happening in a more accelerated fashion. So, one, do you agree with that? And two, could you just discuss YouTube's positioning versus competitors and in particular Facebook Video?","And then Patrick, a couple of quick ones for you. One, given the evolution of tax laws in Europe, how are you and how should we be thinking about Google's tax rate over the coming years? And then also just any comments on stock comp being particularly high this quarter? Thanks.","Omid Kordestani","Thank you, Ben. This is Omid. So the way we look at it is that users are really accessing Internet on large screens with high broadband speeds, and we're getting great monetization on these screens and advertisers are really paying attention. So we have seen a real shift where marketers and agencies who have historically built their brands on TV are really reorienting this toward investments on digital.","And as in regards to YouTube, our focus here is really this focus on investments and more content, more creativity. And I think you also mentioned that you had a Facebook comment. What they are doing I think in video has always helped us with bringing more attention and more innovation to the space, so we welcome that. And the way we're going to approach it is just continue to investing in our platform and on the creators and building better and better monetization solutions.","Just again, you may know some of these metrics, but I'll say it again that we have 400 hours of content that are uploaded every minute and partner revenue is up 60% from 2012 to 2013 on YouTube.","Patrick Pichette","Great. Let me jump, Ben, on the -- your two specific questions. [Audio Gap] tax issues, you've heard about the Ireland announcement earlier this week on the double Irish tax structure. I mean, for us, we've always said that it's for politicians to decide what laws they want to put and then for companies just to comply with those laws. And that's what we're basically doing. So we're deeply committed to Ireland. We've worked there for many years. We have a great -- that's our headquarters. We have over 2,500 employees there. And so from that perspective we're committed to the place. And we're going to work with the authorities just to kind of get clarifications over this. But it's really way too early to tell what's going to happen. So we're, just like you, getting the information, the news, and we're going to work with the authorities to understand it better and then comply with the laws.","In terms of stock-based compensation, just a few notes on this one for this quarter. We have -- it's the time of year where we do equity refresh. And from a timing perspective last year, we did the equity refresh in Q2 instead of Q3. So there's kind of like a geography of Q2 versus Q3 that kind of hit us in Q3. In addition to this, if you go to our filings, you'll see that our executive compensation -- so think of the top 15 or top 20, I can't remember the exact numbers, but it's stated there \u2013 that they do their refreshes every two years and it happens to be this quarter as well. And then finally, I mean, we obviously have more employees. So it's just a compounding set of factors, Ben, that I kind of lumped it all into Q3. So it's no more, no less than that on that -- on that one.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks for your question. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura","Thanks a lot. Just on core operating expenses, is there anything [Audio Gap] Patrick that you might call out in terms of expense growth in the quarter as you have operating deleverage through the P&L? Just wondering, going forward, if that's likely to continue.","And then a question for Omid I suppose on YouTube. You mentioned -- I know that YouTube's investing in its studio as a way to help along new talent, new homegrown talent onto the platform directly. I'm wondering if you can talk about the multichannel networks, how YouTube's relationships with the multichannel networks, the MCNs, are evolving at a high level? How you guys think about that dynamic between the homegrown YouTube talent itself as compared to talent that resides on the MCNs? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Okay. Anthony, thank you for your question. Why don't I jump in right now on just expenses for the quarter? I think if I had two comments to make on expenses in the quarter, you may notice that relative to a few models that I saw out there, R&D was higher and other areas are a bit lower. And I just want to highlight that we hire and we focus clearly our hiring in our tech payroll, or think of it as all of our engineering. And that skews to R&D. So as we bring on people and we push forward the growth of our -- we really focus it in the areas that are going to make a fundamental difference to Google, which is engineering, and by doing so, it kind of skews to R&D. So that's why R&D may be a bit higher than expected by some models out there. And so that's one piece.","And then the other one is just wanted to reiterate that it's very clearly an extraordinary quarter from a hiring perspective for the comments I've made before. And so we're kind of clearly seeing that. But at the same time I wouldn't say that this is clearly a new run rate for us or anything like that. It just happened that most of these college students end up landing in Q3 and we have the result of a banner year from a hiring perspective all through. It takes a year to hire them all and then they come into this quarter. So that's really kind of the two big elements that have actually flowed, Anthony, through our P&L this quarter.","I'll let Omid answer the YouTube question.","Omid Kordestani","Yes. Anthony, so, again, we have a very, very partnership minded organization here and company as a whole. So we view MCNs as -- or organizations that are really going to help develop a great content, support the creators on YouTube. Just like we are doing that with YouTube Studios, I think MCNs can help a lot of these become future stars hopefully and develop more success. So just we view it as another form of partnership that we need to pay attention to and support. So that's how we look at it.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Anthony. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. I have two questions. Patrick, is CapEx still driven by real estate and construction? And if yes, can you explain in a bit more detail what changed about 18 months ago in the way you acquired real estate and build to drive the inflection in capital intensity that we have seen? It looks like you operated for more than 10 years in one way and then there was a shift that has led to this massive inflection. So what happened there?","Secondly, do you think that Google login is adopted or inspired to being adopted by a large enough number of important mobile apps for you to be competitive in the long term when it comes to offering mobile [Audio Gap] and can you give us an update on the developer adoption of deep linking? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","So I can certainly take the first and let Omid answer the second. I've made that comment before in a prior quarter, Carlos. The CapEx intensity and our CapEx program has been built by a combination of, as I mentioned in previous quarter, catching up when we were running too hot in terms of tightening of capacity. And so -- and once I'm very happy that when we really torque our utilization rates, on the other side it creates a lot of operational issues. And that led us to believe that in fact investing ahead of the curve was actually a strategic imperative for us to make sure that if we have the extra capacity, we will grow into it.","And I think the difference between -- certainly on the data center side, data center construction and machines, and you'll have noticed that this quarter again, there are priorities. If you look at the nomenclature I gave, construction of data center is the primary. So it is the core infrastructure, it's groundbreaking and it is setting up the core infrastructures. Machine was the second one for this quarter, but you'll notice that it flip flops real estate. In the case of the real estate, we have been investing for our campus and otherwise when we see -- when we hit kind of minimum scale, we need to kind of make investments in real estate. And again with an eye of looking for the long term, rather than just filling at least for the next 12 months or 24 months, because once you kind of -- if you decide you're going to grow in a place, then you need the capacity for multi-years. So all of these factors have actually kind of been the driver for the shift in capital intensity that you've seen over the last 18 months. So that's basically the explanation, Carlos.","I'll let Omid kind of jump on the second question about the mobile question.","Omid Kordestani","Sure. Thanks, Carlos. So the AdMob network reaches 900 million unique devices per month and our own apps are hugely popular, Gmail, Maps, Google App and YouTube. And our focus is also -- is helping developers generate app downloads and re-engagement with users who have already downloaded their apps, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier. And we're really helping drive hundreds of millions of app downloads through app promotion products.","Again, the goal here is that you just search and not worry about where the answer is either on a webpage or on an app. And we've been in this game for a while. Four years ago, we acquired AdMob and have continued to invest in this space heavily. And this quarter, we launched the next generation of these promotion ads across Google search, Google Display Network, and YouTube. So we're really focused on this area to help the developers and our users.","Patrick Pichette","I think we can clearly say that we're pretty pleased with the developer adoption of this. They see a huge benefit, so they're actually investing in it.","Thank you, Carlos.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan","Thanks for taking the question. Just two for Omid. First, you talked about estimated conversions and seeing a 15% increase there. Can you just talk about whether you think that's actually leading to more spend at this point from advertisers? And then, secondly, are you seeing mobile like-for-like pricing improvements at this point? And what gives you the confidence in mobile closing the gap with desktop over time?","Omid Kordestani","Thanks, Douglas. Both are really good questions that are related really. I think the way this is going to play out is that I think advertisers are going to, with these tools, be able to just understand conversions better -- where is it happening? And then the dynamics of how those changes is all the way back to adjusting bids and then paying attention to where the conversions are coming from.","So, again, I think just to maybe highlight some examples for you, we have a fashion retailer Express who's an early tester, found that the overall return on their ad spend doubled when offline sales were included in their online advertising results. So we're just continuing to invest here and get this right. It's too early to figure out the impact exactly on revenue, but we expect the estimated total conversions to help the advertisers fully measure this and ultimately adjust their bidding and just get much more sophisticated in these measurements. I hope that answers.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan","And mobile on a like-for-like basis?","Omid Kordestani","The way we're focusing this is that users really are using their screens interchangeably simultaneously throughout the day and that we really are not at this point doing this like-by-like comparisons or comment on it because we think it's still early and we're really focused on just again delivering the results. And it took many years, for example, for the desktop ecosystem to develop the right ad formats and really take advantage of the platform. So I think we just need to continue innovating here, experimenting here to get it right.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Douglas. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mark May with Citi.","Mark May - Citi","Thanks for taking my question. One on -- there's been quite a bit of attention paid to cloud services space and Google in particular. Wondering if you can comment a little bit around the traction that you're getting with the Compute Engine? And what sort of impact that that's having on revenue or expenses and CapEx for the business?","And then secondly, I think earlier you made a comment around some changes you've made in mobile that have impacted some of your network click metrics, so hoping you could elaborate a bit more on that.","Patrick Pichette","Okay. Do you want me to...","Omid Kordestani","Go ahead.","Patrick Pichette","I'll just jump on the cloud and then the last piece and then maybe -- I wasn't sure what the very first part of your question, Mark, was. But clearly, cloud is an area that is kind of booming, right? We know that the long-term trends are very clear for us, which is the vast majority of businesses. Everybody is moving their infrastructures to the cloud. So -- and it is an area where we have fundamentally great assets to contribute to this industry, both in terms of the flexibility, the cost structure, the technology, and that's why we're investing heavily in there. We're seeing great progress from an adoption perspective, signing up new customers.","And from a CapEx, obviously you need to kind of -- that's one of them that as I mentioned on the CapEx story with Carlos a few minutes ago, if you do take off and you really get the kind of customer adoption that you expect, if you don't have the capacity in place, it can have a really important kind of differential in your success. So there is one that we're keeping a pretty close eye on from a CapEx perspective in making sure that we have the option value.","The third question was mobile that have network clicks. So, yeah, I mean, clicks and CPCs always fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. It just happens that we've made some -- as I mentioned, made some changes this quarter that improved our mobile pricing while impacting low quality clicks. So sometimes, it goes -- if you think of a long-term trend in the mobile sector piece of our product, sometimes you kind of put a new change in the network and it creates a lot of clicks for it, but then the CPCs are much lower. And then if it doesn't actually create something that's really good for the user, you need to kind of pull back on it, and that's what you've heard, for example, just parallel to the AFS business. So it's kind of constantly fluctuating.","What's really important us is really the combined volume and pricing growth. And so for us, it's very clear that we're doing some great work in this area and monetization in aggregate is doing very well. And that's really what we're -- like on a quarter-to-quarter basis, don't panic about little movements here and there. Look at the fundamental trends, and that's where we're very pleased.","Now, did you have a first -- was there a first question that I missed, Mark?","Mark May - Citi","No. I was hoping on cloud that maybe you could put some numbers behind the level of traction in terms of number of customers impact on expenses, CapEx, the level of investment in the cloud.","Patrick Pichette","I see. Okay. So I've given you what I can give you on that. Again, we're really thrilled by the momentum there and our focus in that area.","Mark May - Citi","Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Mark. Jamie, we'll go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks for taking the question. One for Omid. Going back to estimated total conversions, wondering if we could expect Adometry to be integrated into the DoubleClick platform and how that may or may not work with the estimated total conversions tool? And then, finally, I'm wondering [Audio Gap] on your work around coming up with a solution that reduces the dependence upon cookies and perhaps introduces a cross-platform, a cross-device ID for Google and what impact that could have in the market? Thank you.","Omid Kordestani","Sure. I think -- again, it's early for us to call Adometry. It's a great attribution solution and we've been investing in that tool for a long time now and trying to just get this right by all the innovation that's happening within Google and just really understanding the impact of these usage models and -- between the mobile devices and desktop.","And so I think we're going to look at everything that's available out there, both what we're developing and partners out there that we could partner with, and continue to invest here. It's going to take us a while, just like we experienced before with search, to get this right and have a real end-to-end solution for marketers and publishers. And so I think you will see a lot of innovation in this space. What Facebook recently announced is another approach. And we're going to study that and just figure out what is the right set of offerings from us.","So I guess, unfortunately, I can't give you a very specific answer here. But I think what you'll see from us is pay a huge amount of attention here, make the measurements and see the impact and then offer a full suite to our customers.","Patrick Pichette","Yeah. So just basically, too early to speculate on these issues, but clearly it's an area of focus at the company. Thank you, Peter. Jamie, our next question, please?","Operator","And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you. I had two questions. The first was a follow-up on Google Shopping Express. I mean, just wondering, when you think about what Amazon is doing with same-day delivery, they're obviously building these fulfillment centers themselves, which theoretically should give them scale over time. I'm wondering if you could share with us how you see this evolving for Google over time?","And then a follow-up question would just be related to your comments about payments. And I'm just wondering, how critical is it for Google itself to [Audio Gap] friction that you're seeing with kind of a ubiquitous digital wallet? Or would you be fine with a third-party doing so for the Android platform?","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Heather. I'll take the first and then let Omid answer the second. Clearly, Google Shopping Express, there is an issue of scale and it's a combination of an issue of scale, tools and efficiency. I mean, that's how you, if you think over time, can end up with a product that you can deliver within kind of hours at the right value and where you can make money.","So it's not only about -- yes, for efficiencies you need centralization. You need a bunch of distribution tools that actually work. We're clearly focused on that as well. I mean it is part of the business case that we're building. But you need more than that. There's a lot of other elements as well. So clearly focused like our competitors would be. And our announcements today, again kind of our -- was it yesterday -- yesterday's announcements on Shopping Express kind of tell you that we are investing both for -- the three new cities kind of give you a hint of, yes, it's about scale. So clearly we're focused on that.","Omid Kordestani","Yeah. And Heather, on the wallet question, I think we're going to continue to be open here. So we are trying to get it right and innovating on multiple fronts, as I mentioned earlier. And if partnering makes sense, we'll take a look at it, as well.","So -- and the goal is here really to provide this very seamless experience for the users and then get the merchant adoption and hopefully get this right. I'm certainly delighted every time I use this and it works. And I think if we can all get the ecosystem right and there are multiple players in it and partnerships that are making it happen, we're definitely open to that.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Heather. Let's go to our next question.","Operator","And we'll go next to Paul Vogel with Barclays.","Paul Vogel - Barclays","Yeah. Great. Thank you very much. As Google Play has grown, I'm just wondering if you could talk about the relationships with the carriers and how that's evolving over time.","Patrick Pichette","Yeah, I can answer that. So, essentially, Google Play is doing great and everybody wants to kind of be part of this answer. And so, for our carriers, [Audio Gap] basis. So the real question is, what's the win-win? And so they're all done individually. We have great partnerships with many carriers that actually fuel this, and we're including carrier billing. So all this actually is just a very, very positive ecosystem for us. And so we're totally thrilled to have these partnerships and we expect to continue to do so.","Paul Vogel - Barclays","Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Paul. Jamie, one more question.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","Great. Thanks for the questions. Two for video -- on video for Omid. You mentioned Google Preferred in your comments. Any color on further expanding the upfront process with the ad agencies? Basically, do you anticipate that upwards of 5% to 10% of your top inventory could actually be set aside for preferred longer-term?","And then just given the shift of offline TV dollars to online, as you've mentioned, any comments on political specifically or other new categories more aggressively moving on to YouTube? Thanks so much.","Omid Kordestani","Sure. Thank you, Brian. So we secured upfront commitments from five top agencies: IPG, OMD, Digitas, Carat, SMG, and some major brands like General Motors and Coca-Cola and we were actually very, very pleased with how Google Preferred was experienced and adopted. And so I think we're going to definitely continue working on this. And also if you look at our history, we're very used to the selling model that was all about performance. And then as we added properties like YouTube and Brand and Mobile, we're just getting more and more now gaining a better understanding of how to work in this upfront process, for example, to offer the marketers this incredible asset that we have in YouTube and our network. So we're going to just continue getting better at -- on the products side, figure out how to package this inventory better, and then the tools that are needed, and then on the selling side, just get better at also working with the agencies and our advertisers and marketers to get this type of selling right.","And on the political vertical, I think clients love to use our products as part of their campaigns for federal, local, state campaigns and it is a really great area for us. We have actually a political sales team that's focused on it. So I think you'll see more of that effort from us.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies","Omid, thanks.","Omid Kordestani","Thank you very much.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Brian. Jamie, that's all the time we have. So if you don't mind, I'd just like to close by reiterating what Omid said a bit earlier. This quarter was a great quarter with great momentum again. And I just wanted to thank all the great efforts of our Googlers around the world who make us look good on this call because of their fantastic effort.","So with that, Jamie, I'll let you close the call, and have a happy Q4 everyone.","Operator","Thank you again. That does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate everyone's participation."],"1491":["Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Q1 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call April 29, 2019  4:30 PM ET","Company Participants","Ellen West - Head, Investor Relations","Ruth Porat - Senior Vice President and CFO","Sundar Pichai - Chief Executive Officer","Conference Call Participants","Eric Sheridan - UBS","Doug Anmuth - JPMorgan","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Anthony DiClemente - Evercore","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley","Dan Salmon - BMO Capital Markets","Colin Sebastian - Robert Baird","Justin Post - Bank of America","Ross Sandler - Barclays","Brent Thill - Jefferies","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Alphabet First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen West","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Alphabet\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai.","Now, I will quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business performance and operations, and our expected level of capital expenditures may be considered forward-looking and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.","During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz\/investor.","And now, I will turn the call over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you, Ellen. In the first quarter, total revenues of $36.3 billion were up 17% year-on-year and up 19% in constant currency, following a strong 2018. Once again our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search, along with important contributions from YouTube, followed by Cloud.","For today\u2019s call, I will begin with a review of results for the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by Other Bets and we will include with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.","Let me start with a summary of Alphabet\u2019s consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Our total revenues of $36.3 billion reflect a negative currency impact year-over-year of $1.2 billion or $1 billion after the impact of our hedging program.","With respect to Alphabet revenues by geography, U.S. revenues were $16.5 billion, up 17% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $11.8 billion, up 13% year-over-year and up 16% in constant currency, reflecting weakening of the euro and the British pound.","APAC revenues were $6.1 billion, up 27% versus last year and up 31% in constant currency, reflecting primarily the weakness of the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee.","Other Americas revenues were $1.9 billion, up 10% year-over-year and up 21% in constant currency, reflecting primarily the weakening of the Brazilian real and Argentine peso.","Turning to profitability, in our earnings press release, we provide a table to highlight the impact of the year European Commission fine on operating income, net income and EPS results in the first quarter. I will comment on resu lts both with and without the impact of the fine as I review the results.","On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment results, were $16 billion, up 19% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $9.2 billion, up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google related expenses. The biggest contributor was costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher TAC as a percentage of revenues.","Operating expenses including the impact of the EC fine were $13.7 billion. Excluding the impact of the fine, operating expenses were $12 billion, up 20% year-over-year. The biggest increase was in R&D expenses with headcount growth in Cloud as the largest driver. Growth in sales and marketing expenses primarily reflects additions to headcount. Growth in G&A expenses is primarily due to legal matters, including the effect of a legal settlement gain recorded in the first quarter of 2018.","Stock-based compensation totaled $2.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 103,459 up 4,688 from last quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were in Cloud for both technical and sales roles.","Operating income was $6.6 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fine operating income was $8.3 billion, up 9% versus last year for an operating margin of 23%.","Other income and expense was $1.5 billion. As I trust most of you are aware, in 2018 this line item was meaningfully elevated because of the introduction of a new accounting standard that requires recognition of unrealized gains and losses on equity securities. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.","Our effective tax rate was 18.3% for the first quarter reflecting a sizable impact from the non-deductibility of the EC fine.","Net income was $6.7 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.50. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $8.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $11.90.","Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $4.6 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $12 billion, with free cash flow of $7.4 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $113 billion.","Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $36.2 billion, up 17% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $25.7 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year.","In terms of dollar growth results were led again by mobile search, with a strong contribution from YouTube, followed by desktop search. Network revenues were $5 billion up 8% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance of the primary drivers of growth AdMob followed by Google Ad Manager.","Other revenues for Google were $5.4 billion, up 25% year-over-year fueled by Cloud and Play and partially offset by hardware. Google Cloud Platform remains one of the fastest growing businesses in Alphabet with strong customer momentum reflected in particular in demand for our compute and data analytics products. Strong growth in Play was driven particularly by performance in APAC.","Hardware results reflect lower year-on-year sales of Pixel, reflecting in part heavy promotional activity industry-wide, given some of the recent pressures in the premium smartphone market. We provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our Advertising businesses.","Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.9 billion or 22% of total Advertising revenues and up 9% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total Advertising revenues was down year-over-year, reflecting a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, as well as a decrease in the Network TAC rate.","The Sites TAC rate was flat year-over-year, as the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC was offset by the growth in TAC free Sites revenue primarily from YouTube. In Q1, the Network TAC rate declined year-on-year primarily due to a favorable product mix shift.","Google stock-based compensation totaled $2.6 billion for the quarter, up 13% year-over-year, operating income was $9.3 billion, up 11% versus last year and the operating margin was 25.8%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $4.5 billion, reflecting investments in data centers, servers and office facilities.","Let me now turn to and talk about Other Bets. Revenues were $170 million primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Operating loss was $868 million. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $59 million.","Key recent accomplishments include, Waymo recently announced that it will expand its activities in Michigan, opening a facility into Detroit that will be the first factory dedicated to the production of L4 autonomous vehicles.","Last week, there were exciting announcements from two traditional Other Bets that were originally incubated within X. Loon announced a long-term strategic relationship to advance the use of high altitude vehicles to deliver connectivity, with SoftBank\u2019s telecoms group HAPSMobile, which will invest $125 million in Loon.","Wing became the first drone delivery company to receive air carrier certification from the FAA, an important step toward beginning a commercial service delivering goods from local businesses to homes in the U.S.","Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer term outlook. As we highlighted on our last call, there was a significant swing year-over-year in the impact of currency movements on our results this quarter, from a big tailwind in the first quarter of 2018 to a headwind in 2019.","These affect both revenues and operating income given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S. Based on the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to key currencies, we expect to continue to headwind to our revenues and operating income again in the second quarter.","In terms of our key revenue drivers, with respect to Sites revenues, as we indicated last quarter, the timing of product changes in ads at times can have an impact on year-on-year growth rates. We will continue to make changes with a focus on the long-term best interest of users and advertisers.","We remain confident about the sizable opportunity ahead to improve the advertiser and user experience through our ongoing commitment to product innovation, in particular by leveraging machine learning across our ads products and properties.","Turning to the key drivers of growth and other revenues. We are pleased with the momentum of Google Cloud platform, with balanced growth of both new customers and expansion within existing customers driving revenue growth.","With respect to hardware results, while the first quarter results reflect pressures in the premium smartphone industry, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum for Assistant-enabled Home devices, particularly the Home hub and Mini devices and look forward to our May 7th management at I\/O from the hardware team.","Turning to profitability, with regard to Google OpEx, the first quarter results once again reflect our ongoing commitment to investing for the long-term. You can see that in R&D where we continue to invest in technical talent for priority areas like Cloud, search and machine learning.","In terms of sales and marketing, the pace of investment in Q1 reflected a timing shift in spend and we expect these expenses to pick up in the second quarter. In Other Bets OpEx, we are still early in the life of these companies and do plan to continue to invest meaningfully for the long-term opportunity.","With respect to CapEx, the year-on-year decline reflects the purchase of a building in New York in the first quarter of 2018. As discussed on our call last quarter, while we anticipate that our full year CapEx investments will exceed those in 2018, the growth in investments should be at a meaningfully lower rate than in 2018. We continue to expect a sizable investment in both compute requirements to support long-term growth, as well as in office facilities.","In conclusion, we feel confident about the opportunities ahead and we continue to invest thoughtfully for the long-term.","I will now turn the call over to Sundar.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Ruth. It\u2019s great to be here with you all. Q1 was a very busy quarter at Google and it\u2019s only going to get busier. Later this week, we will host YouTube\u2019s upfronts events BrandCast followed by our Annual Developer Conference Google I\/O next week and our advertising summit Google Marketing Live later in the month. You will hear a lot more from each of these teams throughout May, so I hope you can join us.","We will always be a company that\u2019s focus on the long-term willing to make investments that will help our businesses and our customer\u2019s businesses succeed as technology continues to evolve. You saw this in the transition to mobile computing years ago and we are seeing that today in the shift to AI.","We feel very positive about the enormous opportunities ahead involving search and assistant, capturing new ad budgets, cloud computing, AI and other areas. What gives us these opportunities as Google\u2019s position to help people, businesses and society in countless ways through our products.","Today, I will start by talking about our core mission of making information universally accessible and useful, then I will provide an update on our computing video and advertising platforms, and finally, I will discuss our hardware and cloud efforts.","First, an update in our mission to make information accessible and useful is helping people every day. A big focus for us is building products that are designed to help people in their day-to-day lives.","Our Duplex technology within Google Assistant can now help you easily book a table at your favorite restaurant on all Android and iOS devices in 44 U.S. states. Just tell the Assistant where you want to go and when and it will do the rest.","We have also began testing AI walking navigation in Google Maps, which uses augmented reality and give phone\u2019s camera to show you where you are relative to the surroundings as you are walking.","Just last week, we announced an improved job search experience in the U.S., that helps people easily discover quality remote jobs, allowing them to work right from home. As part of our Google news initiative, we kicked off the local experiments project, working with local publishers to uncover new approaches to their business models and operations, so they can continue bringing great local content to the readers.","AI is now spurring a new era of computing, which is more predictive and more assistive. We are committed to doing deep research and working to advance the space in a responsible way. AI is deeply embedded in our products, from Search to Photos to Google Home and we are also expanding other\u2019s ability to build on our advancements.","Recently at TensorFlow\u2019s Annual Developer Summit, we announced TensorFlow 2.0, making it easier than ever to build an UCML through improvements like TensorFlow Privacy, which helps train models with differential privacy, meaning that users\u2019 data is better protected.","Now on to our computing, video and advertising platforms. There\u2019s tremendous momentum across the Android ecosystem and our other computing platforms as we head into Google I\/O. In the first quarter we released the beta of Android Q, which brings added privacy protections, new tools for developers to engage users and more.","Android Go Edition, an optimized version of Android tailored for smartphones with one gig or less delivers a powerful fast and secure experience, specifically optimized for entry level smartphones. Today roughly 70% of entry level Android devices are now activating with Go like Samsung\u2019s J2 Core.","We are seeing great momentum in Android Auto as well. At the Chicago Auto Show, Toyota announced that it will include Android Auto in upcoming vehicles starting in 2020. That means all of the top 10 carmakers now support Android Auto, and in Google Play, first-time buyers grew by nearly 50% year-over-year. I am very pleased with how these platforms are growing and creating amazing experiences for users, developers and partners.","Our newest platform Stadia, which revolutionizes the way gamers access and play their favorite games and brings together the best of Google\u2019s infrastructure and open ecosystem approach. With Stadia, you will be able to play advanced AAA games on any type of screen instantly without ever needing to download the game or install updates. The reception from gamers in the industry has been incredible and we look forward to sharing more when it launches later this year.","Next our video platform, YouTube. YouTube\u2019s top priority is responsibility. As one example, earlier this year YouTube announced changes that reduce recommendations of content that comes close to violating our guidelines or that misinforms in harmful ways. There are a lot more improvements, which we will be rolling out in the next few weeks and our work is ongoing.","We have also expanded the content offering, availability and the functionality on some of our newer YouTube experiences. YouTube TV is now available nationwide with many new networks and channels added in Q1.","YouTube Music and YouTube Premium are now available in 43 countries up from five markets at the start of 2018. In mid-March, we launched YouTube Music in India, one of YouTube\u2019s fastest growing markets. Since launch, the YouTube Music app has been downloaded more than 15 million times in the country.","YouTube\u2019s Ad business, for both brand and direct response campaigns, continues to grow and support our creators. In Q1, we again saw how YouTube is the go-to destination for watching Super Bowl ads before, during and after the big game. This year viewership of Super Bowl ads on YouTube during the game grows by nearly 60%.","More broadly, across our Ads business, our advertising product team led by Prabhakar continues to build new products for marketers, with more than 100 enhancements introduced every quarter. We do rigorous testing on each of these improvements to ensure that we are creating the best experience for users and advertisers.","Our focus has always been on investing for the long-term rather than managing for results quarter-to-quarter. I feel really positive about the opportunities ahead and the innovations that we are bring to marketers, many of which are powered by machine learning.","Philip on our business teams had done a great job helping advertisers take full advantage of these new capabilities. For instance, more than 70% of our advertisers are already using automated bit strategies and Google Ads and these MO powered technologies help customers get better results for their investments.","In Q1, we began testing new shoppable ad units and Google Images so brands can highlight multiple products available for sale in sponsored image results. You have also seen us make it easy for people to buy products and take action when shopping on Google Assistant and search with a universal cart on mobile, desktop and Google Home devices. Since we launched these capabilities a year ago, the number of participating merchants has increased sevenfold.","Lastly, at the Game Developers Conference, we introduce a host of the advertising solutions for developers, like app campaigns for engagement, which help developers reengage players with relevant ads across Google\u2019s properties.","Next, I will give an update on our hardware and Cloud efforts. First hardware, I am very proud that in only a few short years, we have built a strong foundation in hardware. For example, demand for our Google Home family of products remain strong, especially the Home Mini and Home Hub. The breadth and depth of our product lines across Pixel, Nest and Home is amazing and you will see us continue to develop this incredible lineup.","The team has also done a lot of work to scale our operations and we will continue to optimize our distribution, branding and points of business. We also announced the new campus and engineering hub in Taiwan, largely to support our hardware efforts.","Not only our features like Night Sight in Pixel winning industry awards, but Net Promoter Scores tell us that many people who use our hardware products truly love them, which is particularly important as we move into this new era of computing. We are still early in our hardware journey and when I look ahead of the portfolio that we have created across Pixel Home and Nest, I feel really good about the range of products that we have.","And finally, our growing Cloud business. Thomas has really hit the ground running. Just a few weeks ago, I was on stage with him at our Cloud Next event, where we hosted a sold-out crowd of more than 30,000 attendees.","As I said at Next, moving to the Cloud should be simple and seamless. I was excited to announce and toss, which give customers a very elegant solution to both hybrid cloud and multi-cloud in a single technology stack. The early feedback from analysts, customers and partners has been a really great.","We also announced innovations across many of our other products that enabled developers to build and deploy AI, help enterprises to better secure their data, allow Android users to leverage their phones as a security key and much more.","We are also deeply committed to becoming the most customer-centric Cloud provider for enterprise customers and making it easier for companies to do business with us. Thanks to new contracting, pricing and more.","Today nine of the world\u2019s 10 largest media companies, seven of the 10 largest retailers and more than half of the 10 largest companies and manufacturing, financial services, communications and software use Google Cloud.","Some of the companies that we announced at Next included the American Cancer Society and Mekason in health care. Media and entertainment companies like USA Today and Viacom, consumer packaged goods brands like Unilever, manufacturing and industrial companies like Samsung and UPS, and public sector organizations like Australia Post.","Finally to support our customer\u2019s growth, we also announced the addition of two new cloud regions in Seoul and Salt Lake City, which we plan to open in 2020. These new cloud regions will build on our current footprint of 19 cloud regions and 58 data centers around the world.","20 years in and over 100,000 employees strong, I am incredibly proud of the work that our teams at Google do every day. We have so many bright opportunities ahead and seizing those opportunities starts with their investment in the communities where we operate around the world and right here at home.","In the U.S., not only are we expanding our workforce across the country, but we are helping people in every state, gain the digital skills they need to succeed in today\u2019s economy. In fact just one-year after kicking off our collaboration with Goodwill, 250,000 Americans have learned new digital skills and 27,000 have found a job.","We also feel a deep responsibility to make sure that we -- that as we grow our business, we are doing it with minimal impact on the environment. Today, a Google data center uses 50% less energy than a typical data center, while delivering seven times more computing power than we did five years ago.","Since 2017, we have matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with purchases of renewable energy and I am proud that Google is the world\u2019s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy. I have never been more excited about Google and where we are headed. I want to thank every Googler around the world for joining us on that journey.","With that, I will hand it back over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple of parts on the revenue performance in the quarter. Ruth, you would called out potential volatility on the Q4 earnings call. I wanted to understand a little bit about what you are calling out in Q4 and how that might have manifest itself in Q1 on the product side of the equation, so we could just better understand how much of it was isolated to Q1 or it might be a headwind as we move through the year? And as you look at the individual performance of the ad divisions in sites, desktop, mobile search, YouTube, it seems like you were still calling out strength in mobile search in YouTube. So could it be desktop search where we actually saw some weakness in the quarter? Thanks so much for any granularity and color on that.","Ruth Porat","Sure. Thanks Eric. So I will try to step back and start at the highest level. Obviously, on a reported GAAP basis revenue growth in Q1 reflects the FX headwind that we talked about in contrast to the tailwind last year and as you know well, we don\u2019t report sites revenues on a fixed FX basis, but the delta between fixed and floating growth rates the Alphabet level is a good proxy for the effect on sites revenue.","Beyond that, I tried to draw that the year-on-year growth rate in part reflects our strong 2018. And then more to your question as we indicated last quarter, the other item is the timing of product changes in Ads can impact year-on-year growth rates and we make changes with the focus on the best interest of users and advertisers over the long-term we do not manage by quarter, so we are introducing enhancements only after product testing, and that was sort of the overarching color that I was trying to give you.","And in terms of desktop it was a modest contributor to revenue growth. It does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks such as planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And as we have talked about in prior calls, we continue to see the ongoing importance of desktop for many users and many tasks, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile. So I led with the items that are really driving the growth but that was a bit more color on desktop for you.","Eric Sheridan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Once, again, Doug Anmuth, your line is now open, please check your mute button.","Doug Anmuth","Yeah. Thanks. Sorry about that. So two questions, just following up on Eric\u2019s on the revenue growth. Ruth can you just give us a little bit more detail on the paid click growth, the decel that we saw that at 39% from the 50%s and 60%s last year. That\u2019s just a comp issue or something more specific? And then just on the spending side, I want to understand a little more just how you are thinking about spending relative to three months ago. I know you talked about both CapEx moderating and also headcount moderating three months ago. Just curious at least that headcount is still in that camp figure thinking just given that it seems like there\u2019s a pretty big ramp expected under the new Cloud CEO? Thanks.","Ruth Porat","Okay. So, starting with clicks and CBCs. As we have discussed on prior calls the biggest driver affecting those CBCs and click trends is YouTube engagement ads with YouTube Clicks representing the vast majority of total clicks. And so while YouTube Clicks continue to grow at a substantial pace in the first quarter, the rate of YouTube Click growth decelerated versus what was a strong Q1 last year reflecting changes that we made in early 2018, which we believe are overall additive to the user and advertiser experience.","And then in terms of your two spending the investment questions, in terms of headcount, first, we do continue to expect the growth rate to moderate slightly in 2019 from the year-on-year growth in 2018. And as I indicated in opening comments, we are continuing to invest in technical talent for priority areas like cloud, search and ML. And so cloud has been and continues to be the primary area of headcount growth and as Thomas indicated as well, I think Sundar did as well.","In terms of CapEx just to fill up the last part I think of your question. Relative to my comments last quarter that we expect the full year 2019 growth rates for CapEx to moderate quite significantly versus the year-on-year growth in 2018, there\u2019s no change in our expectation for the year on that point either.","The first quarter last year obviously included a sizable real estate acquisition in New York. But, overall, we continue to invest meaningfully in our technical infrastructure given our outlook for compute requirements to support long-term growth.","Technical infrastructure is the biggest driver of CapEx growth, but we do also continue to invest in office facilities. In fact, as we announced in the first quarter, we expect CapEx of over $13 billion in 2019 just in the U.S. in data center construction and offices, with major expansions in 14 states.","And more generally, while we are investing aggressively to support our outlook for compute requirements, we are also very focused on improving efficiency with our technical infrastructure and you can see that through our innovations and things like custom server hardware and TPUs, which can be more cost-effective especially for machine learning workloads.","Doug Anmuth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you. Sundar, I had a question about Cloud. You guys are obviously talking more and more about it. But when do you think you are going to be in a position to share revenue figures or even growth rates similar to what the others have been sharing for quite some time? And then, I guess, a couple of follow-ups to that are what would you say the biggest competitive differentiators are of GCP. And what also -- what changes has Thomas implemented for 2019? What are any of the big changes he\u2019s focused on that maybe are different than what you are doing before? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Heather. Good question. Overall, I would say, I think, you saw it -- saw the momentum coming out of Next. And I would say, the high level the key differentiators which we are focused on and which we hear from customers to the five key things are security and reliability, being really open about hybrid multi-cloud, customers don\u2019t want to be locked into anyone Cloud provider.","We want to be a platform for open source and so we are really working well there in enabling options. AI, ML as a capability. And finally, as customers think about digital transformations we bring all of Google\u2019s advances to bear to help them through the journey.","I think I would say, Thomas is really building upon a strong foundation, but we are really accelerating and scaling up go-to-market both internally and through our channel partners has been a huge focus. I am incredibly excited that, we just announced a couple of weeks ago that Rob Enslin has joined us to head go-to-market and just along with Thomas, both of them bring close to three decades of serving enterprise customers, and so that reflects the commitment we have. I think we are building a strong business across all our verticals, and we are definitely are seeing a strong momentum, and look forward to being able to share more at the appropriate time.","Heather Bellini","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Anthony DiClemente","Thank you for taking my question. I have two, one for Ruth, one for Sundar. We noticed that large than expected slowdown in the properties TAC in the quarter that includes cost of mobile search, while the other cost of revenues which includes YouTube content cost seem to maintain an expected growth rate despite what you said about more moderate turns in hardware. So just wondering if that\u2019s a wise way to infer anything about the relative performance of mobile search revenue versus YouTube from those cost lines in the quarter? And then on Waymo, maybe for Sundar, we are hearing more and more about collaborations between ridesharing networks and AV provider, so the idea of mixed fleets or part human part AV as a means of potential deployment of AV technology. So can you just comment if that mixed lead approach would be something that you think Waymo would consider versus its own full ride service network? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","So in terms of the sites TAC rate, a couple of things, we have discussed this previous -- on previous calls. We have expected the year-on-year growth in the TAC rate would begin to slow, starting in the second quarter last year and you saw that through the balance of 2018.","And this quarter, the constant TAC rate versus last year reflects ongoing growth in mobile, but it also benefited from growth in YouTube, where the associated content and cost are included in other cost of sales, and so, that\u2019s the most important thing to point to.","The other is -- we have previously discussed is, TAC as a percentage of revenues is also affected by a number of other factors, such as changes in product mix, device mix, partner mix, et cetera. So I\u2019d really point you to the first point there.","And then, as it relates to Waymo, I guess, a couple of things. We continue to be most focused on the ride sharing business here. We are pleased with the expansion and the number of Waymo riders that we have added since the last quarter. But as we have talked about on prior calls, we do continue to pursue a number of other opportunities, long-haul trucking we have talked about, logistics, deliveries, personal use vehicles, last mile solutions for cities, and then probably more to your question, licensing our technology and we did announced in March that we are making one of our 3D-LiDAR sensors available to companies outside of the self-driving car service, beginning with robotics and physical security.","In other words in, for warehouse use or for farming and our view was that, that can provide further operating leverage to our business. So we are actually looking at a number of different ways, but their primary focus continues to be on developing the ride hailing business.","Anthony DiClemente","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Steve Ju","Okay. Thanks. So, Sundar, I wanted to follow up on your Stadia commentary. How are your conversations with some of the larger PC and console publishers going right now? You obviously offered them an additional distribution outlet with billions of users, which is something that they probably didn\u2019t have before. But what is the pushback that you might be getting from publishers if any? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai","I mean, I think, there genuinely, I mean, I think, we see genuine excitement, because I think, they see the opportunity for a shift, a point of inflection, but they realized the technical challenge of pulling something like this off. And so, but once they get their hands on with the technology and then they see the experience, I think, completely wins people over.","And so we are having conversations across the Board and I think people are definitely engaging in a very committed way and they are investing in it and so it\u2019s up to us to bring it all together and have a compelling service later this year and that\u2019s what the team has had done working on.","But I think, not pushback per se, but they want to see our commitment, which is what we demonstrate and they are working hard to make the investments on their side. And so it\u2019s a big joint effort and it\u2019s working well.","Steve Ju","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Brian Nowak","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one just go back to the product changes. Ruth any more color on sort of which products or regions are most impacted by these changes? And just so we can understand a little bit, can you just help us with the key user experience you are trying to solve for and sort of the message to your advertisers who maybe spending -- or maybe growing their spend last now and why it\u2019s going to be positive for the long-term? And then Sundar just regarding your comment about YouTube, you mentioned more potential changes coming on YouTube with the next couple of mix. Can you just talk to us about that a little bit? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai","Yeah. Maybe I will start with the YouTube comments. I talked about in the area of content responsibility, we are definitely focused on making sure we are constantly improving how we are handling both in terms of reducing the content and shouldn\u2019t be there on the platform, and then more importantly, making sure when we recommend content that we are recommending high-quality content as well as reducing harmful content or low-quality content being recommended.","I think we had a set of launch which we have rolled out, but I think there are more lunches coming which will constantly improve what you will see in YouTube and continues to be the most important area of focus for them.","On the first question in terms of products, I think, we are -- I presume when you say it back to product changes, I think, you are talking about the advertising experience. I think the main thing I would say is, I mean, we don\u2019t -- I think we have a long-term way of thinking about where we want to go and we were disciplined framework by which we think and evolve our products.","We don\u2019t necessarily look at it from a quarter-on-quarter basis, though, we obviously have had consistent performances. We approach our work differently and so you are going to have quarter-to-quarter variations once in a while. But we remain confident about the opportunities we see and I am looking ahead to that and we are focused on that.","Brian Nowak","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Salmon","Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar he had reminded us how April and May are pretty big months for the company with a series of your large annual events, and of course, each of them -- each of those businesses have their own goals and targets. But we also hear -- continue to hear more about your teams working together, for example, a large cloud engagement leading to higher ad spending from an enterprise. Can you talk to us just a little bit about how you balance having your leaders grow their own businesses with also incentivizing them to work together? And then second, and kind of completely differently, we would love to just hear your updated views on data collection and use. I am sure you have continue to have some dialogues with the politicians and regulators. We have seen some reports on more potential changes in Chrome or within the advertising platform. We would love to hear how maybe your latest discussions are in view -- are in forming both the near and long-term view on policies with regards to data collection and use. Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks. And you are right, these are a couple of very months and its particularly busy leading up to I\/O. And I would say in terms of how we work together, first of all, as a company, I think, we take our -- okay, our process extraordinarily serious in a very committed way. And we do right across company okay hours and it really reinforces ways by which different groups can work together, and we measure them and hold people accountable to that. That\u2019s an important part of how we get at businesses both while they are focus on their product areas our business need to work together.","Second as a leadership attribute, it something that\u2019s really important to me and so it\u2019s something that the leaders across the table share that goal, and I think, it\u2019s largely cultural as well, vis-\u00e0-vis privacy and it\u2019s actually one of our most important areas. As a company, we have always tried to stay a step ahead. User expectations around privacy are constantly evolving and we stretch ourselves to meet them, and as part of that through this year, we are continuing to do a lot of work just with the overall goal of making sure privacy works for everyone. It\u2019s actually simple to use.","And as part of that, we will have more changes through the course of this year be it Chrome, Chrome is super committed to making sure it\u2019s best-in-class in privacy and security, and we always put user experience first and follow through.","Through all these changes, we need to be mindful of the content ecosystem and the publisher ecosystem. Advertising continues to be an important way by, which they create value and they see value and so we are very thoughtful about how we approach our work.","And there\u2019s been a lot of interest across the Board. I think we are early on engaged with GDPR, our big supporters of it in terms of being constructive and working early to get ready. I think it\u2019s important U.S. supports -- has a clear from work on our federal basis for privacy regulation and it\u2019s something, we feel is timely as well, and so we have call for it and happy to be thought leaders as well as engage where needed.","Dan Salmon","Great. Thank you, Sundar.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Colin Sebastian","Great. Thank you. I have a couple, first one follow-up on the revenue growth dynamics, specifically the sequential growth trend. I wonder, if we should just assume now that there\u2019s greater seasonality in core search just given the increasing mix of shopping and product ad formats. And Sundar, question in AI machine learning, since clearly this remains an area of significant strength for the company. I am wondering, what\u2019s stage of development you characterize these stools at being today and whether we should expect the overall case of advancement from AI to accelerate in terms of products and services? Thank you very much.","Sundar Pichai","On the first question around seasonality and stuff we -- throughout the course of the year, we always deal with many events in a no pattern as. There are a few patterns which are consistent year-on-year, but there are always one-off events which happen, so there is in-built variations -- so which we work through every quarter and so I think that\u2019s a natural part of what we do.","There\u2019s definitely seasonality in businesses like hardware and that you are right commercial behavior has seasonality associated with it. But we do deal a lot with one-off events as well and -- but we always work our way through it.","On machine learning, I do think we are at very early days. I am excited that over the last three years, taking AI first approach we have really incorporated machine learning core -- in a core way across our product to benefit our users and that\u2019s true for advertising as well.","I think we are in early stages of making it easier for businesses to understand what they are looking for and us taking care of more and more work, and we are doing it across the Board, but there\u2019s a lot of headroom here. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Justin Post","Thank you. Maybe one for Ruth and one for Sundar. First Ruth, on mobile search, can you let us know how that did versus your expectations, I know there\u2019s a lot of noise from YouTube in that line. But how\u2019s mobile search doing and what are the key drivers now for mobile searches, is it queries, is it driving higher click-through rates, ad format changes, what are the drivers, as you think about the next couple of years?","And then Sundar, could you just -- on the hardware business, I think, there is some concerns that it\u2019s just not getting off to really strong trajectory, some comparisons to Microsoft 10 years ago. Really, just help us understand how that hardware business is important to Google and how you are thinking about it long-term? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","So in terms of the Mobile Search and the Site\u2019s revenue more broadly, I think, the main point, as we have both tried to indicate in opening comments is, we view the advertising opportunity is significant, given, in particular, the opportunity with machine learning, both for users and advertisers, as well as our commitments to product innovation and being the backdrop of an environment, which nearly half of the budgets in the U.S. are still spent offline and about 90% of commerce in the U.S. is still offline and we are focused on digital playing bigger role in that and tapping into other marketing budgets, by offering an attractive ROI.","And then, apart from people spending more time on digital content, to your question, we know the better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience, all help grow the pie for everyone in the ecosystem.","And then more broadly, within YouTube, as we talked about last quarter, we do continue to see significant growth in direct response and we remain excited about the upside potential there. Brand advertising is still the largest part of the business. It\u2019s growing at a stronger pace. But we would called out direct response given what we see as the upside potential.","Sundar Pichai","Justin, on the hardware business, as I said earlier, we are still in our early days. But our commitment is very strong. We really see this incredibly important to drive the future of computing forward and to make sure our services are presented to users in the way that we intended them to be, and so overall, we view it as a hugely important opportunity.","When we look at the business even for -- given we are more recent to it, we already -- if you take AES like Google Home and Assistant products, we are doing really well. We see strong momentum. I think we are market leaders in the category and especially when you take a look at it on a global basis. And so for -- computing will continue to evolve even beyond phones and so we want to make sure we are in there and we are very committed to it for the long-term.","Phones, definitely, across as an industry, I think, they are working through a phase where there is definite year-on-year headwinds. But I do think, especially, the ecosystem is constantly pushing it forward. I continue to be excited about the innovations be it, 5G coming or the early look into foldable phones, which Android plays a big part in driving.","So I do think there is a lot more to come and we are focused on it. When I look at the product quality, how it\u2019s improving, user feedback in terms of Net Promoter Scores and the range of lineup that we are working and how our products are getting better year-on-year I remain very excited.","Justin Post","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Ross Sandler","Hey, guys. I guess I will just beat the dead horse on the deceleration comment again, but maybe a different way. Ruth so why did Europe and U.S. -- Europe ex-FX and U.S. growth rates dropped off much more than Asia and are there any comment on why the decel was more pronounced in Western markets? And then stepping back we see pretty solid growth rates from the digital ad sector broadly in the first quarter and you flagged a lot of this back in February. So, clearly, this isn\u2019t a surprise to you. But how much of the deceleration insights ex-FX was from maybe advertiser demand issues in these markets versus proactive changes that you may have made on your end to the product? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","So in terms of the regions, the year-on-year growth rates reflect the product comments that I have made with respect to the first quarter. The -- I think the -- you had the U.S. and Europe had about the same delta year-on-year. Other Americas was more pronounced. That was really more of the impact of hardware.","And then APAC, I think maybe was guiding some of your question, continues to be a very strong performer and continue to deliver in the 30% plus or I think 31% on a fixed FX basis. We are well-positioned growth throughout the regions. Sundar\u2019s comments on some of the things that we are seeing, a big focus on the next billion users and excited about the opportunities across the Board there.","Sundar Pichai","And I don\u2019t think there are any demand issues to the last part of your question, and as we said earlier, we work through a set of product development pipeline in a very disciplined way focused on user experience and that makes it\u2019s way too and that\u2019s how we approach it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will be our final question today from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Just a follow-up on the last question on EMEA and U.S. Was there any go-to-market changes in terms of the sales force or how you said quarter anything that may have been effectively, a Q1 seasonality issue that may see some snapback in Q2?","Ruth Porat","The opening comments I said that one of the points is that we had a strong year last year and we are looking at performance in line with that. I would say more broadly overall in terms of go-to-market, our long-term investment thesis remains unchanged. We are excited about the opportunities ahead. We do continue to invest to ensure we remain well-positioned for the long-term. That applies across the businesses and so that there wasn\u2019t a change that anything other than the comments that I had made.","I think if I could just maybe expand on the investing pace, as we are looking at the pace of investing and supporting growth around the globe, what we are really looking at is what\u2019s needed to support long-term revenue and earnings growth, the operating margin did benefit, and as I noted in my opening comments that, from the fact that Q1 marketing expense, growth moderated, but that was the timing issue. We do expect to pick up the marketing expense in the second quarter and other than that really nothing to comment on.","Brent Thill","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for closing remarks.","Ellen West","Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call. Thank you and have a good afternoon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"1488":["Alphabet Inc.

Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen West","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai.","Now, I\u2019ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor.","Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2016 filed with the SEC. Undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements and they are made are made based on assumptions as of today. We undertake no obligation to update them.","During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release.","As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz\/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website where a replay of the call will be available later today.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thanks, Ellen.","We had a fantastic 2017 with total revenues of $110.9 billion, up 23% over 2016 and operating income of $28.9 billion up 22% year-on-year excluding the EC fine. Our momentum reflects the relentless focus on users, advertisers and enterprise customers as well as the benefits of our commitment to long-term investing.","For the fourth quarter, revenues of $32.3 billion were up 24% year-on-year. The ongoing very strong performance in sites revenue in particular reflects the combined benefits of innovation and secular growth with mobile search again leading the way. Healthy growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. Substantial growth in other revenues, mainly hardware, cloud and Play continues to highlight the benefits of our investments.","Our outline for today\u2019s call is, first, I\u2019ll view the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. In order to facilitate comparisons of this quarter\u2019s results to prior periods, we have also provided the tax affected line items, excluding the impact of the U.S. tax legislation enacted at the end of 2017. You can see the components in our earnings press release.","Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. I will then conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights, after which we will take your questions.","Starting with the summary of Alphabet\u2019s consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues of $32.3 billion were up 24% year-over-year and strong across all regions. U.S. revenues were $15.4 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $10.3 billion, up 24% year-over-year. In fixed FX terms, EMEA grew 22%, reflecting strengthening of both the euro and the British pound. APAC revenues were $4.7 billion, up 30% versus last year and up 32% in fixed FX terms, reflecting weakening of the Japanese yen. Other Americas revenues were $1.9 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 30% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strengthening of the Canadian dollar.","On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I\u2019ll discuss in the Google segment results, was $14.3 billion, up 34% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $7.8 billion, up 34% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, specifically, costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, hardware-related costs for our expanded Made by Google family of products and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube.","Operating expenses were $10.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year, in particular, reflecting an increase in marketing spend, given the holiday season. Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 80,110, up 2,009 people from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count additions were once again made in cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we place on this business.","Operating income was $7.7 billion, up 15% versus last year, and the operating margin was 24%. Other income and expense was $354 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release.","Our provision for income taxes on a reported basis includes $9.9 billion for items associated with the U.S. tax legislation, resulting in a reported net loss of $3 billion and loss per diluted share of $4.35. Excluding the impact of the U.S. tax legislation, our effective tax rate was 15%. Our net income was $6.8 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.70.","Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $4.3 billion. Operating cash flow was $10.3 billion with free cash flow of $6 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $102 billion.","Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $31.9 billion, up 24% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $22.2 billion in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by solid growth from desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.","Network revenues were $5 billion, up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $4.7 billion, up 38% year-over-year, fueled by hardware, cloud and Play. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.","Total traffic acquisition costs were $6.5 billion or 24% of total advertising revenues and up 33% year-over-year. The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.","Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year, reflecting primarily an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The underlying trend affecting the network TAC rate year-over-year continues to be the shift to programmatic which carries higher TAC.","Google\u2019s stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the year, up 1% year-over-year. Operating income was $8.8 billion, up 11% versus last year and the operating margin was 27%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.","Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. I\u2019ll cover results for the full-year 2017 because it remains most instructive to look at financials for Other Bets over a longer time horizon, as discussed on prior calls. Results for the quarter are in our earnings release.","For the full-year 2017, Other Bets revenues were $1.2 billion, up 49% versus 2016, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss was $3.4 billion for the full-year 2017 versus an operating loss of $3.6 billion in 2016. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $507 million, down from $1.4 billion in 2016, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber. We\u2019re pleased with our progress across Other Bets.","A couple of updates. Nest turned in a strong holiday performance in the fourth quarter across an expanded family of products in energy, safety and security. In 2017, Nest products also became available in 12 new countries, more than double the number in 2016. Verily wrapped up its first field study seeking to reduce the transmission of the diseases through mosquitoes with positive results. And just last week, Onduo, a joint venture between Verily and Sanofi began a limited commercial launch of its diabetes management platform.","At Waymo, progress is accelerating. For example, Waymo surpassed 4 million miles of driving in the real world, taking only six months to achieve the last million miles compared to that 18 months for our first million miles. And in November, Waymo announced that it is the only company to have a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous without anyone in the driver\u2019s seat.","Let me close with some observations on our priorities and longer term outlook. Our 23% revenue growth in 2017 was powered in particular by the ongoing extraordinary performance of our sites business. Both mobile and desktop search continue to grow and benefit from our approach to innovation with strong momentum as we identify additional opportunities to enhance the user and advertiser experience.","As we\u2019ve consistently emphasized, alongside the continued momentum in our advertising business, we are focused on building a second wave of growth within Google over the medium and long-term which includes the rapidly growing revenue businesses in Google, cloud, hardware and YouTube. With respect to cloud, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of a fully featured enterprise offering and an expanded go-to-market team, bringing our advantages in infrastructure, data analytics, security and machine learning to more customers. And we are pleased with the momentum in our hardware business in 2017, driven by an expansion in both our product line and geographic availability. Finally, as we look further into the future for our third wave of growth, we remain excited about the longer term potential for our Other Bets businesses.","Overall, operating income was up 22% year-over-year in 2017, excluding the impact of the EC fine, although there was obviously fluctuation in the rate operating income growth quarter-to-quarter. Within cost of revenues, the biggest component is traffic acquisition costs, reflecting our strong revenue growth in mobile search and the fact that mobile search carries higher TAC than our desktop business. While we expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue, reflecting ongoing strength in mobile search, we anticipate that the pace of year-over-year growth in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenue will slow after the first quarter of 2018.","Within OpEx, we are keenly focused on prioritization in order to optimize the resources we\u2019re investing for longer-term growth. As I discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, marketing spend in the fourth quarter is significantly elevated, in particular supporting hardware but also across cloud and YouTube. For 2018, we remain excited about the investments we are making to drive the next phase of growth in our big bets in Google in cloud, hardware and YouTube, and our machine learning efforts which are powering innovation across our businesses.","You will see us continue to support our priority areas with increased headcount which will remain concentrated in R&D. With the closing of our deal with HTC earlier this week for example, we\u2019ve added 2,000 employees to support our hardware business. With respect to SBC, we\u2019ve completed the transition to a single annual compensation cycle for employees with a full year equity refresh grant to employees in the first quarter of 2018. Our biannual grant to SVPs will also occur in the first quarter and you will see the combined step up in our first quarter results. For our Other Bets in 2018, we will continue to calibrate the magnitude and pace of investment appropriate to their individual execution path.","Finally, our framework for capital allocation is unchanged from our prior discussions. The primary use of cash continues to be to support organic growth in the business. We are excited about the significant opportunities we\u2019ve identified in our businesses and continue to invest appropriately. We then layer in a sensitivity analysis regarding potential M&A as well as CapEx, in particular computing infrastructure, to support the needs of these growing businesses. The most sizable catalyst for added investment in compute power include the expanding application of machine learning efforts across Alphabet as well as additional requirements for Google\u2019s Cloud, Search and YouTube businesses. This framework further considers complimentary uses such as the share repurchase. After taking these potential investments into account, our Board has decided to extend our share repurchase program up to an additional 8.6 billion of Class C capital stock.","In conclusion, 2017 was another great year and we are very excited about the opportunities ahead. I will now turn it over to Sundar.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Ruth.","Our teams are off to a great start in 2018. This year is special as it\u2019ll mark 20 years since Google was founded. A lot has changed but our mission organizing the world\u2019s information and making it universally accessible and useful remains the best guide for the next 10 years.","Technology is an incredibly dynamic industry. We\u2019ve been laying a foundation for the next decade as we pivot to an AI first company, powering the next generation of Google products like the Google Assistant. And we have been making substantial investments in our three biggest bets, cloud, YouTube and hardware. These bets have enormous potential and already they are showing real momentum and gaining traction. Today, I\u2019ll start by sharing some of the exciting progress in these three big bets.","First, Google Cloud. Google Cloud, which includes Google Cloud Platform and G Suite, has reached meaningful scale, and I\u2019m excited to share today that it\u2019s already $1 billion per quarter business. In fact, we believe that Google Cloud Platform, based on publicly reported data for the 12 months ending December 2017, is the fastest growing major public cloud provider in the world.","We are also increasingly doing larger, more strategic deals with customers. In fact, the number of deals worth over a $1 million across all cloud products more than tripled from 2016 to 2017. The strength of our products and the value of working with Google is increasingly clear to partners and customers.","In the fourth quarter, we forged new and deepened existing partnerships with industry leaders including Cisco for open hybrid enrollments, Salesforce for customer insights and productivity, and SAP for AI and data insights across their products. These collaborations span our entire company from engineering integration to marketing programs to joint sales, and they cover Google Cloud Platform, G Suite and Google Analytics.","We also saw accelerating customer traction on our wins [ph] included global brands like Bed Bath & Beyond, then to Dentsu Aegis Network Aegis Network, Keller Williams, Mattel and Tyco Retail Solutions. And underscoring the increasing importance of Google Cloud to the enterprise, we surpassed another new milestone, 4 million paying customers on G Suite. ","Next, YouTube. Every month more than 1.5 billion people come to YouTube to watch their favorite content on channels ranging from the Ellen Show which has more than 22 million subscribers to the NBA with over 8 million subscribers to SciShow, a really popular educational channel with more than 4.5 million subscribers. In fact, there are over 1 billion learning related video views everyday on YouTube. I learned that this week.","With all this great content, people are thinking of YouTube more as a key part of their TV viewing experience. For Tuesday night State of the Union, more partners used YouTube to live stream the address than ever before, generating 5 million live views. And just yesterday, we announced a partnership with Major League Soccer\u2019s LA Football Club, YouTube TV will be the exclusive home to watch all locally televised English language matches in addition to their original programming and content. YouTube TV is now also available on Roku.","There is great momentum around the world with localized versions of YouTube now in 90 countries in 80 different languages. Just this morning, we announced that we are expanding the popular YouTube Go app to over 130 countries around the globe. The app has great data usage transparency and controls built in, which is especially useful for people living in regions with limited connectivity. In the fourth quarter, we also strengthened our relationship with the music industry, signing new licensing deals with Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. We also partnered with Ticketmaster to help fans by tickets to see their favorite artists perform live.","Third, our growing hardware business. Our Made by Google hardware products were very popular this holiday season. Device shipments in the fourth quarter have more than doubled year-over-year. Our retail partners also saw strong performance. Our devices are available in stores like Best Buy, Target and Walmart. I\u2019m especially excited about the popularity of our Google devices for the home like the Google Home, Mini, Max and Chromecast. In the last year, we have sold tens of millions of these devices and counting.","I want to call out the great work of our marketing and design teams. Our hardware is beautiful individually and as a family, and people love discovering the unique features like the built-in Google Assistant. Earlier this week, we officially closed our deal with HTC, which will bring great talent to drive even more innovation in the years to come.","Turning to our efforts in machine learning. Our AI research and innovation leads the world. Our mission to better organize the world\u2019s information has been transformed by these technologies with our Search products and the Google Assistant at the heart. There is great momentum around the Google Assistant as we bring it to more people on more devices. It\u2019s now available on more than 400 million devices including speakers like Google Home as well as Android phones and tablets, iPhones, headphones, televisions, watches and more. People love to use the Assistant on all these devices. There was a lot of excitement around the Google Assistant at CES from partners and consumers where we brought the Assistant to new surfaces like smart displays from brands like JBL and Lenovo as well as Android Auto which is now available in more than 400 car models from brands like GM, Hyundai and Volvo.","One area that\u2019s really benefiting from our advancements in AI is photography. The Pixel 2 phone is the leader in video rankings by industry standards, with smoother and clearer videos, thanks to machine learning and our video stabilization technique. And Google Photos continues to grow from strength to strength. On New Year\u2019s Eve alone, over 3 billion photos and videos were uploaded to Google Photos. More broadly, we want everyone to be able to use machine learning for their own needs. We recently gave Google Cloud customers, access to AutoML which makes it far easier to build complex new enrollments. Since it launched a few weeks ago, over 10,000 customers have already signed up to try it.","Lastly, I\u2019ll give a quick update on our computing and advertising platforms. First, Android. To provide a better, more tailored experience for our next billion users, we made Android Oreo Go edition available for our device partners. This year, we expect to see Go devices from dozens of manufacturers and with great support from mobile operators and app developers around the world. I\u2019m confident that this will bring the power of smartphones to many more people for the first time.","Google Play is also growing well. Just last week, we introduced audiobooks, so you can now catch up on your favorite books any time on multiple devices. And in Latin America, number of unique monthly buyers on Google Play grew by over 50% year-over-year in 2017. Chromebooks also continue to gain momentum and traction. Third-party research tells us that fourth quarter sales of consumer Chromebooks in the U.S. grew by over 70% year-over-year.","Moving to our advertising platforms which help large and small businesses. As shoppers turned to their mobile phones this holiday shopping season, Google was central to helping them discover new brands, compare products and find the best deals. We redesigned the mobile shopping experience on Google, brining more product information to the forefront like reviews and ratings. We are also making the payments experience simpler, safer and more consistent. We brought our payments efforts together as a new Google Pay, which shoppers can use to pay online, in stores and across Google products like Chrome and the Play Store. Companies like Airbnb and Instacart are using Google Pay to speedup mobile checkout. And HotelTonight found that customers using Google Pay are 65% more likely to complete their bookings.","We also have really strong momentum in app promotion ads. The majority of our app promotion campaigns are now using Universal App campaigns which is part of our focus on simplifying the advertiser experience.","Additionally, we introduced a new playable ad format in Google Play that allows users to sample games before they install. Ads in Google Play are performing really well for developers. And our app promotion business on YouTube is flourishing. We launched major initiatives such as store visit measurement and location-based ad formats to drive online to offline commerce. We are focused on making sure YouTube is a great place for users and advertisers while helping creators earn money from popular content.","In addition to the significant work we are doing to product users and stop abuse on the platform, just a few weeks ago, we announced changes to advertising on YouTube, including stricter monetization criteria, new manual reviews for all videos in Google Preferred and simpler controls for marketers. The feedback we have received from advertisers and creators so far has been really positive.","So, as you can see, we are making great strides in our biggest bets, and I\u2019m proud of the work we are doing across the Company. I\u2019m also incredibly proud that as Google grows, we are making significant contributions to our partners, the economy and our local communities.","Our business continues to benefit our partners around the world. This includes news publishers, app developers and YouTube creators, who we share revenue with. Over the last four years, our partners have earned over $100 billion; that\u2019s incredible and we are working on new ways to drive even more value to our partners. In the U.S. specifically, we have offices and data centers across 21 states and we plan to hire thousands of people across the U.S. this year.","Last year in the U.S., we grew faster outside the Bay Area than in the Bay Area. To support this growth, we will be making significant investments in offices across nine states including Colorado and Michigan. We will also be building or opening five big new data centers in the U.S. And with digital skills and high demand by employers, our Grow with Google initiative will have job seekers and small businesses gain education and skills to help them succeed. Just a couple of weeks ago, we announced that we are creating an IT support certification program that will give thousands of people scholarships and job opportunities. More than 10,000 people have already signed up, which is amazing.","I want to thank all our employees, Google users, partners and advertisers around the world. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about what\u2019s in store for all of us this year.","With that I\u2019ll hand it back over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, coming out of CES and the success you had with Google Home and the Google Assistant during the holiday period based on the blog post you guys put out, can you identify some of the key investments in either partnerships or hardware or capabilities that you\u2019re targeting over the next one to two years to make sure the momentum around Assistant is sustained? And then, Ruth, looking at cost of goods sold that came in quite a bit higher than we thought, and you were lapping one-time charge, if we have it right, versus the year-ago period. Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the pressures in cost of goods sold that were either seasonal or maybe a new normal in terms of higher level, going forward? Any color there would be really appreciated.","Sundar Pichai","On the Google Assistant and Google Home we are very excited about the momentum we saw in CES. It actually reflects work we\u2019ve been doing for a while. Google Assistant in some ways brings together all the technology we\u2019ve been building for years, and it\u2019s an extension and it\u2019s supported by Google Search as well.","We are also thinking about our capabilities broadly beyond just one device alone, and that\u2019s what we are doing here across phones, across all surfaces. So, that\u2019s something big we\u2019re focused on. And the second is we have always built ecosystems, be it Android or Chrome or Chromebooks. We work with many, many partners and scale up things, right. And so we are leveraging those best practices and trying to build this in a way in which the entire ecosystem can ship products with the Google Assistant and generate value. So, I think the framework is great, and long-term, our investments in AI will directly manifest its capabilities for users through the Google Assistant. So, I\u2019m very bullish on it.","Ruth Porat","And then, in terms of gross margins, it obviously reflects our product mix. And as you know well, the TAC rate for each of sites network as a percentage of revenue lines, that\u2019s continued to increase because they\u2019re our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic and so carry higher TAC. But, as I indicated in my opening comments, we do estimate that the year-on-year increase in the sites TAC rate will slow after the first quarter of 2018. And then, the other thing to note, other cost of revenue does reflect the seasonality of hardware, having increased both the number of products and the Made by Google family as well as continuing to expand geographically in western Europe and APAC, you can see that reflected here.","Operator","And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","Two quick questions, one for Ruth, and Sundar. I guess, Ruth, just to follow up on your comments there, the partner agreements which you just cited.. Is there any color you could give us on how these typically work? And what I mean by that is are they typically multiyear deals on average? And how do we think about these impacting the rate of change in TAC, since you are talking about the pace of growth in TAC as we look out, call it in year two if these are multiyear deals? And then, for Sundar, I guess, I wanted to follow up a little bit with what we saw at CES. But, how do you think about voice? And given the significant number of devices in the market, how do you think in the future about traffic acquisition strategies on these devices, as you look five years down the road? Is there any reason to think that the strategies might be different that you are going to follow as you look ahead, than what we\u2019ve seen over the past, call it since the advent of the iPhone? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","So, on your first question, there is not much really that I\u2019m going to be able to add there. I mean, given the ongoing momentum in our mobile search business, this does continue to be relevant, as you look forward, given mobile carry\u2019s higher TAC. But, the rate, as per your question, has also reflected changes and partnership agreement. So, all factors considered, we expect the year-on-year increases will slow after the first quarter of \u201818. And as I\u2019ve said on many of these calls, we are very pleased to have a very strong position in a rapidly growing market and that momentum does continue. I guess, the only other thing to add is that Q4 TAC as a percentage of revenue does benefit from the fact that the fourth quarter is a seasonally strong quarter for YouTube. So, quarter-on-quarter changes are less insightful because CAC is distinct from TAC. It\u2019s not in this number but not much more to add there. Pass it to Sundar.","Sundar Pichai","And Heather on voice, we are very excited by voice. We obviously see it being adopted strongly in countries like India; it\u2019s actually a significant part of just mobile search queries in general. And things like Google Assistant and doing Google Home kind of really accelerates the trend. But, we definitely see more multimodality. So, as you saw, we also announced many smart displays at CES. And I think that will be an exciting trend as well. So, we will bet on all of that. In general, I think about -- we want to be there for users when they need us and we want to serve everyone. This is why we work across the ecosystem, we do first party devices, we do it globally, and so, we are committed to doing that well. So, I think, it will be an extension of how we have approached search from day one and trying to serve everyone. And so, I don\u2019t overall see a big shift.","Operator","And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Douglas Anmuth","Some big news earlier this week just in terms of Waymo with FCA talking about delivering thousands of minivans to Waymo later in the year. So, I was hoping Ruth, you could just talk to us more about the timing for that business and how we should think about the economic model there, as you move to operations and deployment phase. And then, secondly, the cash now obviously much more accessible in terms of what is held overseas, could you just talk more about your plans there? Obviously, the bigger buyback there but still not meaningful in terms of the overall size of the company.","Ruth Porat","Sure. So, first on Waymo, we do remain very excited about the opportunity with Waymo and our continued progress on multiple fronts, in particular the rider program in Phoenix we\u2019re excited about and we\u2019re expanding our testing to more states. In November, we announced that Waymo\u2019s self-driving TAC reached a major milestone, becoming the only company to have a fleet of driverless cars on public roads that are completely autonomous. And that builds on our more than 4 million test miles driven in the real world in seven states, 25 U.S. cities, we\u2019re currently driving, self-driving I should say, 10,000 miles every day with billions of miles in simulation and robust testing at our private facilities. So, to your question, we do continue to explore a range of options beyond the program, we\u2019re piloting in Phoenix including ride sharing and personal use vehicles, logistics, deliveries and working with cities to help them address public transportation objectives. That being said, our first commercial application is the ride service that we will launch in 2018 that would be open to members of the public in Phoenix and riders will be able to use the Waymo app to have one of our fully driving -- self-driving cars without a driver at the wheel. So, we are very excited about that.","And then, in terms of cash, I think the main point as we think about it is there is no change in our approach to our capital allocation framework. We\u2019ve consistently been focused on long-term investing. We talked a lot about that already on this call and our framework has been therefore very consistent. The priority, the first use is organic, it is investing in the many opportunities that we have. And the second is strategic. And we do remain active with smaller M&A deals, in particular to support our cloud business and hardware. The HTC deal which we just closed is a good example of that. Third is CapEx. So, we continue to invest in machines to support growth we see across Google but in particular supporting Cloud, Search, YouTube and all that we are doing in machine learning. And then, finally that leads to return on capital. And when we considered all of that that\u2019s led us to extend -- have the Board extend share repurchase program which we announced a couple of years ago. And we will let you determine what that number represents in true Google fashion. But it\u2019s just a modest increase to what we have been doing previously.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Brian Nowak","I have two. The first one, Ruth, you called out desktop search, I think the second straight quarter as being relatively strong. Could you just talk about some of the drivers of the strength in desktop? And how do you think about the sustainability of continued strong desktop growth in the 2018 and beyond? The second one kind of a question on search query volume. There is often speculation and question marks around how consumer behavior is changing in ecommerce and weather Google is still capturing as many ecommerce searches. Could you just talk to what you are seeing in retail search query volumes and search user growth within ecommerce in the United States?","Sundar Pichai","Overall, look, we -- obviously Search is very broad. And even when you talk about commercial thing, we serve across many, many categories including things like from travel to hotels and to services to products and so on. So, we are very, very comprehensive. And obviously, ecommerce is evolving a lot and we continue to invest there. Google shopping is doing well. And we work hard to make sure we bring the best experience possible, which is why I said [ph] they were also Search and Assistant we partner with companies like Walmart for example to make it much easier to buy products and so on. So, we invested a lot there. You are right, consumer behavior is changing but we are comfortable given the breadth of how we do things and how we are focused on user experience there.","Ruth Porat","And on your question on desktop, there really isn\u2019t one particular item to call out here. And that\u2019s why last quarter, I tried to walk through the process that our team goes through and the way they look at innovation, really stepping back and recognizing that the way we all use smartphones and desktop is continuing to evolve. So, therefore, there is utility and challenging assumptions about evolving user behavior and advertiser preferences, and that opens new lines of inquiry which benefits not just mobile but also desktop. And desktop did deliver solid revenue growth. It does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks such as planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And we are pleased with the ongoing strength. I\u2019ll leave it to you to do any of the forecasting. But, we just view it as yet another valuable form factor and are really pleased with the performance there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Evercore.","Anthony DiClemente","Thanks for taking my questions. One for Sundar and for Ruth. Sundar, on YouTube, you mentioned that 1.5 billion people come to YouTube. Any other information you can give us there on user growth or engagement trends would be great, anything on time spent, I mean particularly as YouTube becomes more mature and mobile video particularly in North America gets more competitive. And then, also on YouTube, anything around new products or features driving the monetization or ad business? And then, Ruth, just a question on the growth in marketing spend in the fourth quarter. I think you said that the 4Q was significantly elevated. Should we interpret that to mean that the growth rate in selling and marketing year-over-year should decelerate off the 4Q? And then, just related to that, you\u2019re getting a good return on investment from this marketing spend, particularly when you think about media mix and all the spend that we\u2019ve seen on TV as compared to digital marketing?","Sundar Pichai","Look, on YouTube, we are continuing to see great momentum. Maybe one area which for example highlights how well it\u2019s doing is if you think about YouTube on TV, people actually want watching YouTube on the big screen, our growth has been significant there. And so, increasingly people use YouTube for -- we see it being used to across every possible use case. And I said it earlier in the call. Every day, we get over a 1 billion user on educational content alone. People use it to go, catch upon sports, music, entertainment. And so, you can think about the breadth of -- historically, YouTube has been very strong on mobile and continues to strong on mobile. It\u2019s doing particularly well in the next billion user markets. Our growth last year was very strong there, which is why we supported it with investments like YouTube Go. And we are seeing it now grow well-beyond mobile, especially in the leaving room. So, a lot of momentum there.","Ruth Porat","And then, in terms of sales and marketing, as I said, it particularly supported hardware but was also supporting Cloud and YouTube. And as both, Sundar and I\u2019ve said, these are important Google growth areas for us and we are investing to support growth in the business. The elevated levels this quarter did reflect both seasonality and strategic decision to invest in these brands. And so, view it as a very important part of the overall investment and what we view as very sizeable opportunities. And it\u2019s both supporting the brand and the momentum therefore going into 2018, but this is very specific product focus as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Daniel Salmon","Sundar, I\u2019ll go with the European theme. First, curious to hear your thoughts on the potential impact of GDPR, maybe both on your own sites and properties and how any business practices may need to be adjusted for that but also for tools like customer match that you are advertisers may use. And then, second, I\u2019ll take a shot at it. Any updates on your dialogue with the EU officials and regulators on the proceeding there?","Sundar Pichai","Good question. I was just in Europe last week, it was exciting to be there. There is clearly momentum we feel in terms of how Europe is doing. And we are very committed to the region. We are opening new offices there. We announced AI center. We are committed to hiring more engineers and supporting staff there. So, it\u2019s an important market for us.","On things like GDPR, we want to be -- we have been thoughtfully engaged there. I think it\u2019s important to put privacy first for European citizens, and we are very supportive of the work that\u2019s underway there. And we are committed to complying with GDPR across all the services that we provide in Europe. There is still time. As a reminder, it doesn\u2019t go into effect until May or so. And we are working to make sure all our products are ready. And we will work hard to make the transition well. In terms of -- again, with the European Commission, we have long had constructive conversations. We are understanding their concerns and responding with thoughtful changes, and we will continue engaging in a thoughtful way.","Operator","And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Colin Sebastian","First, Sundar, your comments on Google Cloud were upbeat. And I wonder how much of the momentum there is related to machine learning capabilities offered as service. If you could frame just how important that is for the cloud business overall? And then, as a follow-up on Google Home or the voice-based assistant. If there is any update in how you are thinking about monetization from a transactional perspective, transactional model with perhaps retail partners or do you see an ad-based model emerging there as well?","Sundar Pichai","On the first thing calling on cloud, particularly last quarter, we obviously brought AutoML to our Google Cloud customers. To me that shows the rate at which we are bringing our internal advances. It\u2019s just a year ago, I remember reviewing with the team and they first showed me the AutoML work, we spoke about it at Google I\/O, and it\u2019s pretty cutting edge work. And to turn it back around and to provide it for everyone in the world, I think that shows the power of what we can do with Google Cloud and get our state-of-the-art and get it to everyone.","I think the momentum there obviously is due to our strength in machine learning, the kind of open agile development environment we provide security, and then the combination with G Suite. But above all, I think what -- we\u2019ve always -- we\u2019ve been doing cloud now for 19 years because Google itself was built on a cloud platform. But where the momentum is really coming from is over the past two years, we\u2019ve put a lot of effort to make sure we are enterprise scale ready. So, now we can handle any type of enterprise, any kind of regulatory complexity, security complexity and so on. And that\u2019s evident in the business wins we are seeing. So, we are signing customers who are very large across-the-board, globally. And I think that\u2019s driving a lot of momentum there.","On your question on Google Home and voice-based assistant and how we are thinking about monetization. There are a lot of interesting ideas internally. So, teams are excited about trying new things. We see a lot of potential. But the guidance I\u2019ve given the teams is to be squarely focused on user experience. We are really getting started. I think these are going to be powerful technologies. But, there are areas where we clearly feel all of us fall short for doing right by users and getting their expectations -- matching their expectation. So, you\u2019ll see us focused on user experience there for a while to come.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Michael Nathanson","One for Sundar and one for Ruth, both on YouTube. So, first question was as Google Preferred kicks up a little heat on types of qualities that makes the cut for your videos. Do you feel you have to take a more active stance and looking at what is in Google Preferred -- sorry YouTube Preferred and how are you going to go about that? And then for Ruth, the past year was one where we heard a lot about brand safety. And I wonder when you look back at the YouTube results in 2017, is there any noticeable signs of maybe a shift in ad spending from some of the brands who were making those complaints? So, those are my questions.","Sundar Pichai","I probably can talk about both as they\u2019re related. We obviously want to make sure YouTube has a great experience for users, content creators and advertisers because it supports content creators. And we took a lot of steps last year but particularly in December we adopted a new rigorous approach. And that\u2019s a much more stringent standard for creators. For example, they need 1,000 subscribers to be eligible for monetization. We are manually reviewing Google Preferred videos. We obviously use machine learning to support that a lot and they both go hand in hand. We have provided improved controls for marketers and we are also working with trusted third party vendors to assist brand suitability. So, it\u2019s a comprehensive approach to make sure all of this works well. And so, while there have been concerns but we are working really hard to address them and respond strongly. And so, I think we\u2019re focused on the long-term opportunity here and I think we are setting ourselves up well for the years ahead.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Sena of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Ken Sena","So, just a question, searches seem to be coming more qualified through travel as far as filtering the price that people want to pay, locations, amenities et cetera. Is there any trend that goes along with that in terms of maybe depressing search volume growth to some extent because of the more filtered aspect? And then, secondly, does the higher qualification trend tie in at all to the shifts towards programmatic and in terms of other parties that might be involved or the discussion that we had around TAC? And then, maybe two, just as a follow-up, if you can provide just a little bit more color on Google Pay in terms of what might be different in this round versus previous attempts?","Sundar Pichai","Maybe I\u2019m not fully sure I understood all the specifics there. But, at a high level, as people are on the go, they are travelling et cetera, if anything, I think search is more invaluable than ever before. All the work we do in local searches applies incredibly when you travel, the properties we have like Google Maps et cetera, go along with it. So, overall, I think they all add up to a better user experience and hence a better opportunity for us. Google Pay turns out to be an important part of all of this. As we move from just answers to helping users complete actions about time including transactions, the ability to complete the transaction is an important part of it and which is why making sure Google Pay in a unified way works as seamlessly as possible is a big part of our long-term strategy.","Operator","The next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Stephen Ju","So, Sundar, I think Ruth cited hardware in the prepared remarks as the largest contributor in the fourth quarter for the other revenue line. As you look at the roadmap going forward, you acquired the HTC engineers to bring that team in-house. So, looks like for the first time you have an integrated hardware and software team under one roof. So, how do you think your product development pace and strategy will change for smartphones and other devices going forward? And also, does it make sense to bring the Nest team to be more integrated into core Google as well given the drive to increase the touch points for all the Google products to other form factors?","Sundar Pichai","You are right that part of the reason we are so excited about being able to bring this world-class team in-house is while we have been working together already, we have had to straddle a company boundary to do that. But now, having them as Googlers, will really make that integrated development, which is so critical for us to do it better. We bring a unique approach to hardware, the combination of AI plus software plus hardware. So, being able to get those teams working together, I think would really drive the pace forward. And the best example of that is you see the advances we have made with both still and video photography on our phones. And the Nest team is very, very closely aligned with the Google hardware team. They work hard to realize a lot of synergies there. We already shared a lot of our go-to-market efforts. And we increasingly are collaborating on product development as well. So, we collaborate closely, and I\u2019m excited at the possibilities there as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Justin Post","First for Sundar, it didn\u2019t feel like there is many visible search changes this year as far as coverage or ad formats? So, I would love to hear your thoughts on search innovation pipeline as you look at the 2018 and key growth drivers going forward? And then, Ruth, in the prepared remarks, there was a lot of comments on investment in your medium-term business growth drivers, offices, data centers and other areas. And I\u2019m just wondering if you view 2018 upcoming as an investment year or kind of more of the same of what we have seen over the last couple of years?","Sundar Pichai","Justin, when you think about Search, one of the ways I\u2019d encourage you to think, we think about user journeys. So, a lot of the innovation that we are doing has gone on to not just an individual query and how we respond but how we think about what our user is trying to accomplish over a series of successions. Are you trying to plan a trip and how do we do it better; do you have a health-related area where you are trying to learn more about it, and how do we help you through that. And so, it\u2019s not always just changing a specific format but understanding context better and bringing you that information through a journey. And I think so, there is a lot of innovation that\u2019s happening in that direction. And also underlying is what I said earlier, it\u2019s not just providing the answers, how do you help them get to that information and act on it. And so, maybe you found something and you want to call, call that place or maybe you are trying to order a birthday gift and we actually want you to -- want to go a step further and help that -- help you buy that gift. So, that\u2019s along the lines. And the innovation is happening across search and assistant in integrated way.","Ruth Porat","And then, in terms of your investment question, we\u2019ve consistently been investing across Alphabet and we have tried to be very clear about our investment priorities, all with a view to supporting healthy, long-term growth that goes back to the inception of the Company. Year-on-year op inc growth that you have seen does include these sustained investments for all the areas that both, Sundar and I have talked about, for the year up 22% versus last year. Obviously a lot of variability in growth quarter-to-quarter. And that we just continue to be focused on doing the right things to support growth of the business. The fourth quarter does reflect the obvious seasonality. And again, we continue to look across various, their needs and try and prioritize that we can remain committed to long-term growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. ","Ben Schachter","Just a couple of questions. Can you discuss the evolution of the business model for Waymo? You are launching the ride hailing service in Phoenix, you\u2019ve worked with manufacturers. You talked about other models. But, when you think about the sort of 5 to 10-year view of that, what will the primary business model look like? And separately, can you talk about what is interesting from a strategic point of view about the video game business? You are making some key hires there and just wondering what you think Google can bring to that industry that would be innovative.","Ruth Porat","So, on Waymo, really not much more to add. We\u2019re really pleased after years of work on technology where it was really about safety, safety, safety and developing the technology and the platform. And now we are in a position where we have this opportunity to let people use and benefit from what we\u2019ve developed. So, I think that safety has been a key driver and the opportunity for cities has been really exciting what it means about optimizing resource base that they have. So, it\u2019s still very early days and we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re pleased with all the progress the team\u2019s made. But, it would be getting out of ourselves to go further out than what we\u2019ve laid out here.","Sundar Pichai","On the video gaming side, I think, look, we are -- maybe today have a lot of momentum in these areas, both with YouTube as a platform, Google play. So, these are assets that really worked well, and we will continue investing there. Nothing new or interesting to share with you at this time.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks.","Ellen West","Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect.

So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that accompany this call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website in a few hours. ","Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor.

Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Larry.","Larry Page","Good afternoon, everyone, and happy new year. Welcome to our first earnings call of 2012. Great to have all of you here. ","I'm very happy with our results. Google had a very strong quarter with revenues up 25% year-on-year, 9% quarter-on-quarter, and we blew past the $10 billion mark for the first time. Pretty exciting. ","Looking back on 2011, I am most excited by the fact that we significantly improved our velocity and execution, my priority when I became CEO in April. With Google+, we shipped on average a new feature every day since we launched in June. That's more than 200 updates in total. And those things include a bunch of new Hangout features. In fact, David Beckham just did a great Hangout with his fans here this morning. We launched circles in Gmail and + Pages for businesses and many, many other things. ","I'm also pleased to announce that there are over 90 million Google+ users, well over double what I announced just a quarter ago on our earnings call. Engagement on + is also growing tremendously. I have some amazing data to share there for the first time. + users are very engaged with our products. Over 60% of them engage daily and over 80% weekly. ","As I said last quarter, Google+ is much more than the individual features themselves. It's also about building a meaningful relationship with users so that we can dramatically improve the services we offer. Understanding who people are, what they care about and the other people that matter to them is crucial if we are to give users what they need, when they need it. ","Take last week's Search announcement, which I'm really excited about. We've now included personal results in Search. So you can easily find information like photos and + posts that are super relevant to you, as well as the people you care about or are interested in. You can even restrict all personal results or easily view Google in the world mode just as you would have before. I really like it, and I encourage all of you to try it out, too. ","Each of improved execution and velocity is focus. There are so many opportunities for Google today. But to make a real impact in the world, we need to make hard choices about where to focus our efforts. ","Since we last spoke, we've announced that we're closing 12 of our products, including Buzz, Knol and Friend Connect, integrating a whole bunch of others into features of existing products. This means that we can double down on the really big bets we had made like Android, Chrome, Gmail, Display and YouTube. And I'm pleased to say this big bets are really paying off. We're seeing extraordinary velocity, the kind of velocity we only we can dream about. Android is, quite simply, mind-boggling. 700,000 phones are lit up every day. And I'm pleased to announce 250 million Android devices in total, up 50 million since our last announcement just in November. In just 2 days over the holiday weekend, 3.7 million Androids were activated. And today, we're announcing over 11 billion downloads from Android markets. Wow. Ice Cream Sandwich, which is the new Android release in October, is by far our best build yet. And our exciting new phones. I simply love my Galaxy Nexus. Superfast, it's great for photos, has an amazing 720p screen. ","Chrome is on fire, too. It's a wonderful example of kind of beautifully simple, intuitive experience that really improves users' lives. People thought we were crazy. Who wants another browser? It turns out a lot of people wanted to get to web quickly and securely, and we've got an amazing, fast-growing fan base all around the world. ","From the start, Gmail had security, accessibility. Get all your emails from anywhere on any device. An insane storage. That made it a winner with consumers, businesses and education. From an internal beta project 8 years ago, I'm proud to tell you today that Google Gmail now has more than 350 million active users, and it's growing rapidly. That [indiscernible] said, our merging high-use project -- products can generate huge new businesses for Google in the long run, just like Search, and we have a ton of experience monetizing those old [ph] products over time. Take Display. We brought the science of search to the art of the Display, creating a business that our latest figures show has now reached an annualized run rate of over $5 billion. ","I have some exciting new numbers also for the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, spending is up over 130% year-on-year, and the number of buyers and sellers have both more than doubled over the same period.  I'm very pleased with the advertising on YouTube. TrueView gives users much more choice over what they watch, and advertisers only pay when someone watches their ad. ","It's not just in advertising that we're doing well. Enterprise is doing great with over 5,000 new customers signing up every day. In fact, last week, we signed our biggest ever deal, about 110,000 users at BBDA, one of the world's leading banks. All of our experience says that well-run technology businesses with tremendous consumer research, make a lot of money over the long term. ","Now all of this is made possible by the exceptional people that work here. I've always believed that you attract the best talent by working on things that matter in the world and creating a great workplace environment. People want to feel part of the family even when they're at work. So I'm super pleased that Google topped Fortune 2012's Best Company to Work For list, which was published today. We've taken the #1 spot 3 times now, more than any other company. I want to thank everyone at Google for all their hard work that has made this possible. ","Let me finish up by saying that 2012 promises to be a fantastic year. We're still at the very, very early stages of what technology can do. By building a meaningful relationship with users, we can start to offer  them, just what they need, exactly when they want it. Everyone here at Google is super excited about our work today and what the future holds. It's great to be here. Thank you for taking the time to join us today, and I'll now hand over to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you very much, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us again. Like Larry, I'm also very happy with our results. Google had a strong, a really strong quarter, in fact, with revenues up 25% year-over-year, crowning a year of disciplined investment, strong growth and actually great operational and financial performance. ","Let me go through these financial results, then I'll turn it over to Nikesh and Susan for more commentary on our operating performance. So let's jump right in. ","Our gross revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $10.6 billion, 9% quarter-over-quarter growth. By the way, it's worth noting that although currency rates had an immaterial impact year-over-year, they, in fact, had a negative impact on revenue quarter-over-quarter. In fact, if we applied last quarter's exchange rates to our Q4 revenue, these would have been roughly $240 million higher. So FX is a key component here. Google website revenue was up, in fact just shy of 30% year-over-year to $7.3 billion and 8% quarter-over-quarter with strength across most major geographies and verticals. Our Google Network revenue was up 15% year-over-year to $2.9 billion and 11% quarter-over-quarter. It's important to note here that the Network revenue was again negatively impacted by the search quality improvements we made early last year, and also that the momentum in our Display business continues, something that Susan will talk about in a few minutes. Our other revenue was up 50% year-over-year to $410 million and 6% quarter-over-quarter. Our global aggregate paid click growth was very strong, up 34% year-over-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost of click growth was down 8% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Remember, too, that this is an aggregate number, which includes both google.com and our AdSense properties. On this, it's important to look at CPCs and clicks together. There are numbers of factors that affect each, again something that Susan will address in the next few minutes. ","If we turn to our geographic performance, the U.S., U.K. and rest of worlds all were growing at strong pace, reflecting in our result. In our earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor website -- Relations website, you'll see we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. ","Revenue from the U.S. was up 22% year-over-year to $5 billion. Our non-U.S. revenue accounted for 53% of our total revenue, or $5.6 billion, up 28% year-over-year, which includes a modest $25 million benefit from our hedgings program. The U.K. was up 21% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. ","Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $2.5 billion or 24.1% of total advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $1.2 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of $77 million. And finally, operating expenses, which excludes stock-based compensation, totaled $2.9 billion. Our stock-based compensation totaled $459 million, and the increase year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to payroll, increased advertising and promotional spend and legal and professional services. As a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 38.2%, a strong margin performance that gives us the confidence to continue to fully fund our strategic growth areas in Search, Display, Mobile and apps. ","If we turn to headcount, it was up approximately 1,100 for the quarter, and we ended the year roughly at 32,500 full-time employees. Our effective tax rate was 22% in Q4, and this reflects the mix of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries, but also an impairment charge for Clearwire, which is not [ph] deductible for tax purposes. ","Let me now turn to cash management. In other income and expenses, our line was minus 18, which is a large negative variance, in fact over $300 million quarter-over-quarter. This reflects a couple of things. First is the impact of our significant FAS 133 expense from hedging program, which accelerated the expense of our portfolio this quarter now that this portfolio is much deeper in the money. In addition, as I mentioned, we took an impairment charge for Clearwire. And so for more details on our OI&E, which changed quite a bit this quarter, again please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. ","Our operating cash flow was very strong at $3.9 billion, just shy of $4 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $951 million versus last quarter at $680 million, and remember that the majority of our CapEx spend was related to facilities and production equipment. And as a reminder, I wish to continue to make -- we'll continue to make significant CapEx investments, and these have shown to be lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on when we're able to make these investments. In consequence, we're very pleased with our free cash flow, which was $3 billion. ","So in summary, with such a strong performance, we continue to be optimistic about investing in our growth agenda. Let me now hand it off to Nikesh, who'll cover more of the details of our sales performance for the quarter. Nikesh?","Nikesh Arora","Thank you, Patrick. I will now provide an update on our business activities. We've had an excellent quarter, good growth over the holiday season. Robust [indiscernible] growth on Black Friday and Cyber Monday has led to strong performance across our product portfolio and $10.6 billion in revenue this quarter. Let me talk first about how our sales team have driven the introduction of innovative ad products that delivered impressive results for our advertising customers and outline performance by region. And finally, a few highlights from our marketing and partnerships teams. ","First in Search. Our core desktop Search maintained robust growth as we continue to help our customers grow their businesses. Beyond our robust core growth supporting online sales, we're increasingly helping our advertisers to use Search for branding, as well as something interesting, which is driving in-store sales for them. For instance, by using the power of data insights, we collaborated Carrefour in France to analyze over 2 years' worth of data demonstrate how 1 euro invested in online ads helps deliver almost EUR 8 of in-store sales. We expect to promote these kinds of programs further in the coming quarters. Additionally, we saw similar success in the study with SFR mobile, France's second largest mobile carrier, where we demonstrated a 20% marketing ROI for off-line sales resulting from online advertising. So our Search business continues to be strong. ","Let's move on to Display. As Larry mentioned, we're continuing to see great revenue growth. Our investments have really paid off in the last few years. Display has now reached an annualized run rate of over $5 billion as we engage with multiple advertisers and get tremendous support from our agency partners. What is particularly satisfying is how we're able to drive this growth as a consequence as of our continued investment in innovation with products like Ad Exchange and new ad formats like TrueView. I'm sure Susan will talk a lot more about these. All these are resulting in more efficiency and in revenue for both of us and our publisher partners. On the sales side, we have continued to align our teams, now the combined Display and Search sales, to help meet the needs of our advertising partners. We continue to activate the Display ecosystem of agencies, advertisers and other publishers. Advertisers like Ford, GM, Electronic Arts, L'Oreal and their agencies continue to see the efficiency of online branding and move more and more of their marketing spend towards our products, to Google Display Network and YouTube. For example, at L'Oreal, we demonstrated that online advertising is far more efficient than television as our new formats in YouTube, which include TrueView in-stream, in-slate and in-search have provided significant reach for their branding campaigns with millions of impressions, great click-through and efficiency gains. ","Let's move to Mobile. We had another record quarter for mobile advertising as mobile search continues to surge across all platforms. The number of our clients who are using mobile within their campaigns continues to grow rapidly. For example, Mali [ph] Hotels of Spain with 350 hotels in 35 countries, they use mobile search campaigns to support their mobile e-commerce activities. As a result, Mali [ph] has experienced a 60% increase in visitors for mobile devices, and their mobile-driven bookings have multiplied by 12 in 2011. ","We also worked hard to develop the Mobile ecosystem. This quarter, we kicked out -- kicked off the go mobile campaign in the city of Mobile, Alabama, where we helped hundreds of customers build their mobile sites for free, starting a program that will inspire, educate and empower businesses to continue to go mobile. ","Let's move to Enterprise. As Larry mentioned, we are seeing great traction in our Enterprise business, both with large partners, who tend to be early adopters and future looking, and in many small businesses who see Google Apps as a comprehensive and quick solution. We now have more than 5,000 customers signing up to Google Apps every day. As Larry mentioned, BBDA was the first major bank to go Google with Apps. Costco, one of the world's largest retailers, has also gone Google. In addition, in Q4, we signed government deals with the states of Maryland, Utah and 5 top universities, including Berkeley, Harvard and Michigan. ","Let's move quickly to country performance. From a regional perspective, we continue to see strong performance in the Americas. However, generally, country growth rates are flat or softened slightly partly due to comparisons with a very strong Q4 in 2010. North America saw slight decreases from preceding quarters. Year-to-year growth rates, however, [indiscernible] remained robust boosted by a strong holiday season. In particular, Cyber Monday led the way as the biggest day of the quarter. Western Europe was broadly stable as the U.K., France and Italy held steady, while Spain accelerated slightly for the third quarter in a row. However, revenue growth in Germany slowed this quarter. Our key emerging countries continued to see rapid growth across all of our product areas. ","Let me switch gears to marketing and partnerships. Our marketing and partnerships programs continue to provide strong foundations for the growth of our business. You may have seen many of our initiatives on Google+ this quarter, in addition to the Hangout with David Beckham Larry mentioned. Our sales teams have helped our customers create over 1 million Google+ pages, as Larry pointed out, including Global brands such as Toyota, Zaphos and The New York Times. Additionally, we continued the momentum of our Get Your Business Online program. In 2011, this program has helped bring hundreds of thousands of businesses online across the world. And we got 100,000 businesses to come online in 20 countries in Q4 alone. Last quarter, we expanded internationally to India, Sweden and Malaysia, as well as domestically to additional states like Michigan and New York. ","Our partnership team continues to drive great results with our partners. We renewed 35 of our direct search partner deals, and our long-standing Search distributor deal with Mozilla was renewed as well. These and other efforts helped our syndicated Search revenues accelerate in Q4 as we saw the full impact of large deals and fast growth of 3 partners. ","In closing, Q4 was a great quarter for us, finishing a strong 2011. We're excited to continue serving our customers, partners and users in 2012. And before I hand over to Susan, I want to give a shout-out to our business teams around the world and our partners in product and engineering for these great results. I will now turn over to Susan, who will discuss product performance this quarter. Thank you.","Susan D. Wojcicki","Thanks, Nikesh. Larry mentioned last week's launch of Search, plus Your World. And I'd like to start by talking about that a bit more. ","Google Search has always been about finding the best results among billions of web pages. And until now, those results have been limited to the public world of the Internet. What we added last week was the ability to search your own world, including Google+ post photos and profiles relevant to you, all from the same search box. ","Let me give you a few examples of how this transformed my searches. Last week, I searched on CES, the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, to find out more details about the show. In addition to the public results, my search magically included pictures my friends and colleagues had taken while at the show, as well as products they thought were interesting to share. In addition to seeing all the standard news for CES, I was able to get a much more personalized view of the show. This weekend, I also searched on Yosemite since I was thinking about our summer plans. In my results, I was able to see pictures my friends had taken while in Yosemite and posts about interesting things to do there. There was even an article from my mom that she had shared with my family circle, warning us not to get too close to the waterfalls. ","Turning now to ads. We continue to improve ads quality, and we launched about 20 improvements this quarter. Patrick mentioned that paid click growth was very strong this quarter and that CPC has declined. It's important to look at clicks and CPC metrics together since more clicks can often lead to decreases in average CPC and vice versa. When we make ads quality or format changes, CPC and paid clicks may be impacted differently. For example, when we introduced sitelinks, we saw an increase in clicks. But the additional clicks were on lower-CPC ads, which reduced the average CPC. Many of the ads quality changes in Q3 increased paid clicks at lower CPCs, and they were revenue positive with good user and good advertiser metrics. These ad quality changes from Q3 had a cumulative effect on Q4 metrics. Another important and key driver of the change in CPC growth was foreign exchange. And lastly, there are mix effects with Mobile and emerging markets. ","Moving on to new ad formats. These new formats now appear on about 30% of queries that show ads. Product Listing Ads, which include prices and pictures of products, saw a lot of success over the holiday season. Traffic to consumer sites from Product Listing Ads was up over 600% year-on-year. This quarter, we expanded Product Listing Ads so they can show up to 5 products, which was great for holiday shopping. We are also working to make it more efficient for advertisers to use AdWords. Many businesses have a large and dynamic catalog of products, and it can be time consuming for them to select the keywords and the CPCs for each product. So this quarter, we beta-launched Dynamic Search Ads, which generates the ads automatically based on what's on a customer website. This enables businesses to advertise a lot more of their products, and our system can also monitor the advertiser's available inventory and show ads only for what is in stock. For small local businesses, we ramped up AdWords Express. This product lets businesses get up and running with a campaign in just a few minutes. Customer sign-ups have more than tripled in the past 6 months. We now offer AdWords Express in the U.S., U.K., Germany and France, and we are trialing it in several other countries. ","In Display, which now has reached a $5 billion annualized run rate, as Larry mentioned, we're creating a comprehensive solution to buy and sell display ads across many types of digital media, such as desktop, video and mobile. One key driver of growth has been our success in audience buying. This technology enables marketers to deliver ads to specific audiences across the web, such as in-market hybrid car buyers or adventure travelers. Many audience buyers purchase via the Ad Exchange, which now has customers in 26 countries and is growing very rapidly. We also expanded to video and mobile inventory on the Ad Exchange. And on the Google Display Network, we're also growing audience buying. From Q3 to Q4, the number of active advertisers using interest category marketing increased over 60%. And that was from an already large base. By understanding users' interests, we've been able to serve much more relevant and useful ads to our users. ","Our success in Display has also been driven by brand advertisers, with video formats being an important factor. Our TrueView in-stream ads give users the option to skip the ads. This means that users who see the ads are more likely to be interested in those products, and advertisers are incented to create compelling ads. View rates range between 15% and 45%, and the people who choose to watch those ads are highly engaged. Over 60% of our in-stream ads are now skippable. It's an increase of over 4x since the beginning of the year. We now serve TrueView video ads across the Google Display Network and on YouTube Mobile. ","I'd also like to give a quick update on Offers, which has been bringing online users to off-line stores and services. Offers are now live in over 30 cities, and we're starting to feature national offers from partners like REI, JetBlue and Toys \"R\" Us. We expanded our collection of deals to include offers from partners so that users get a wider variety and partners get access to a broader user base. ","And lastly, among the many launches that we did in the quarter, I'd like to highlight one project we did called Memories for the Future. This site compares before and after Street View photographs of the areas affected by last year's tsunami in Japan. We drove thousands of miles so that future generations can see what happened. Thanks all for your time. Now back to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Susan. So what we'll do is we'll turn it over to Jamie to set up the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Brian Pitz with UBS.","Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe you could just give us a sense for mobile usage. Did you see a major shift in the mobile usage among the consumer during the holiday? And then I've got a quick follow-up.","Larry Page","This is Larry. Let me give that question to Nikesh.","Nikesh Arora","Look, we're seeing mobile usage grow with leap -- by leaps and bounds. It's happening by a proliferation of Android devices around the world. It's happening by a proliferation of tablets around the world. It's happening generally by people getting more and more active on their mobile devices as they discover the utility and the various apps that allow them to be able to go find things, whether they're local searches, they're product searches or they're searches for generic things on Google. So yes, we are seeing tremendous mobile usage, and we saw -- seem to be an uptick during the holiday season where people were looking for products and searching for e-commerce-related activities during the holiday season.","Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just as a follow-up to that, so do you think that the reason for the significant decline in the CPC is -- the down 8%, is a function of the clicks going through mobile more so? Or is it more some of the other factors that you explained to us? Because I'm just trying to get a sense for the down 8% CPC number was, I guess, significantly different than what we were expecting. And I understand the trade-off with the clicks, but is mobile largely responsible for that?","Nikesh Arora","I'm going to pass that question on to my friend Susan here who's going to talk about the CPC.","Susan D. Wojcicki","So there are definitely multiple factors whenever we look at these metrics because these metrics are aggregate. But I would say the 2 biggest factors this quarter were FX as well as the changes that we had made, their ad quality or format changes, which increased the paid clicks and again were revenue positive, advertiser positive, user positive. But those clicks, as I explained, may be lower CPC like in the example that I gave in my script with sitelinks. So those were the 2 factors. But again, it's always important to remember there are many factors that contributed to these aggregate numbers.","Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Just a quick housekeeping. Patrick, can you just qualify what's in that $5 billion Display run rate? Is that comparable to the $2.5 billion you provided before?","Patrick Pichette","Yes, it is exactly the same definition. So you take out all the text ads, and then you look at both mobile and desktop. So you go back to the same definition.","Operator","And we'll go next to Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.","Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two quick questions. I guess first for Nikesh. It looks like international, excluding the U.K. revenue price load, the most kind of sequentially. I was wondering if the macro economy played at all a role? And if so, any sense of magnitude there? And then secondly, for Susan, with respect to the $5 billion Display run rate number, there's obviously a lot of stuff that goes in there between YouTube and Mobile and the ad network. I was wondering if you could just give us some maybe color of what the blended TAC rate would be for that $5 billion.","Patrick Pichette","So I'll take both questions, if you don't mind. So first, we will not -- we don't provide the TAC rate on the blended. And you're right that, I mean, if you think of the big properties that are in there, right, so you will have the GDN, we'll have YouTube, right, we\u2019ll have all of the additional elements of our Display business, which includes the Teracents and then all of the other optimizers but also the AdMob on mobile. So that's the kind of key elements of it. But we do not -- we don't kind of comment on the details of the blended TAC on them. On the economy, look, we had actually quite a solid Q4 performance, and we're really pleased of our revenue growth. I mean, even despite the FX issues -- so you have to separate the FX issues from the economics fundamentals of our business. And performance in Europe was actually quite healthy despite the environment that we got there. And that's driven by the secular shifts of off-line to online continues, and the secular shifts of more mobile continues. So from that perspective, right, obviously, we don't control the economy, we don't control exchange rates, but we're actually quite pleased with the performance that we've had internationally in addition to the U.K. and the U.S.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.","Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about YouTube. I know that in that Display bucket. Could you quantify it at all? Is the growth you're seeing out of YouTube similar to what you're seeing in the overall Display bucket? And specifically, are you seeing a sign that TV ad budgets specifically are migrating online into assets like YouTube? When you ask advertisers who are spending more money in YouTube, where those dollars are coming from? Where are they coming from?","Patrick Pichette","So let's do a 1-2 punch quickly. YouTube is doing absolutely terrific. And on the advertising side, Nikesh will probably be the better answer to give the details. Or Larry, whichever of the 2.","Larry Page","Yes, I\u2019d say on  the advertising side, I think we're tremendously excited about our growth on YouTube. And the amount of success we're having in advertising there is very significant. But it's not significant compared to the overall kind of video advertising space. It's a tiny percentage of that. We have a huge amount to grow. But I don't think the advertisers are thinking about it as being a significant percentage of their other spend on video. So we don't really see that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research","On Android, the numbers are obviously very, very strong. But can you talk about the monetization potential that\u2019s beyond Search? What has to happen with Android for you to actually make money on this? And how are you going to do it? And then secondly, the revenue growth did decelerate more than I think most people expected. And you had such strong tailwinds with Mobile and Display. Do you think that some of the deceleration came from people going to information directly through apps or going directly through vertical search like going to Amazon directly for commerce or Expedia directly for travel?","Larry Page","Yes, I mean, Ben, maybe I'll take the first on there on Android. I think we are in a very -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we're in the early stages of monetization for a number of our new products, and Android is one of those. I think we do make money from Search on apps. We do make -- we mentioned that we have a very strong advertising business on mobile, which we obviously -- a lot of those people are on Android as well. And I think that you also see we announced 11 billion downloads on Android markets. Obviously, a lot of those are free, but we also are having a lot of people buy stuff there, too. We've seen a lot of potential for us to make money on Android, and I think you'll see us increase that a lot over time. It's hard to give you details about that right now, but I'm very, very optimistic.","Patrick Pichette","On the second part of the question, let me jump in. If you look at our growth -- first of all, you're right that FX played a part. You also have to remember that last year at this time, right, we had such a strong comp. We had such an amazing Q4 of 2010. That the year-over-year comparison in a way represents also this really high kind of level on which to start from. And so from that perspective -- and if you also look at our mix between our own Google websites versus all of our network, I mean, our core properties continue to be actually very strong. So for all these reasons, I wouldn't be worried of the way that you've described it. In fact, we've got -- continue to have very strong growth.","Operator","And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just had another follow-up on CPC. And kind of as you look out given -- to the first half of the year, and given the metrics that Susan rank-ordered or impacting them in Q4, how do we think about how those metrics that you rank-ordered might impact them in the first half of the year or just even looking out over the next quarter? What are the things we should be paying attention to?","Patrick Pichette","Yes, I mean, at the highest level and then maybe Susan can jump in if she wants to add additional, if you think of the core elements of it, she mentioned quality. And we -- the -- all of the Panda changes and everything we talked about, right, its full year is going to be represented only by the next spring. And then FX rate, we don't control ourselves. So obviously, it has a significant impact. The rest of it is actually the mix between how the innovation that we drive to our products, which is if you have a great product that drives a ton of clicks and it happens to have lower cost or CPC, then that's still for the benefit of everybody. So then, that's really about our innovation agenda, but we don't give forward guidance on that.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. But it just looks like those trends that you mentioned that impacted Q4 are in existence as we look out, at least initially, into 2012.","Patrick Pichette","I think you have to make the call on the FX yourself. And then on the...","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Aside from FX, obviously, right.","Patrick Pichette","Yes, yes and then the quality, I think will going to -- flow through the year, sometime in the spring.","Susan D. Wojcicki","I mean, the one thing I would just add is, the way we think about the business is we're focused on how do we provide better ads for our users and for our advertisers, and we look at all of those metrics combined. And what we saw in Q3 was we made a bunch of changes. They were small. There was no one individually that actually affected things, but it just so happened that the changes we made drew more attention and caused an increase in paid clicks. And so, as I mentioned, there are many factors. But really, what we use as a guiding metric are to understand that something is revenue, advertiser and user positive.","Operator","And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford C. Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Help me reconcile the 15% year-on-year growth in Google partnered revenue with the 130% growth in the DoubleClick Exchange and the $5 billion run rate for Display. I mean, something -- it seems that something must be decreasing. And how do we make these numbers close?","Patrick Pichette","Look, I think that you have to remember -- in the highest level, you have to remember that sites and network lines in our financials are not good proxies for Search and Display revenue, right? I mean, in its most simple term, YouTube, which is Display, right, ends up in our Google sites. And yet, AFS which is Search, is included in the network. So when people actually do the math, right, it's really easy to get confused between these lines. So I would kind of caution you to have one which is growing at 15% obviously being -- jumping to the conclusion that that's Display. That doesn't work.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So does that mean that a material portion of the $5 billion come from YouTube?","Patrick Pichette","All I'm saying is we don't give the breakdown, but you could -- I just want to make sure that you --  caution you that because of these mix issues, right, it can lead to interpretations that are wrong.","Operator","And we'll go next to Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the CPCs for a minute. And it sounds like -- and we can obviously take the FX out, but it sounds like you're saying that the improvements in 3Q were perhaps a much bigger factor than the mix shift toward mobile in terms of CPCs. Susan, can you provide any more color there in terms of the improvements that you made which could drive sort of a meaningful shift like that? And then secondly, TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues have been down for many straight quarters now, and here they ticked back up a little bit. Can you clarify that at all, the reason for that?","Patrick Pichette","Yes, on the latter -- let me just jump in on the latter and then I'll let Susan give a bit more color, commentary. But it's just mix issue between partners. So as you have partner mix, it will just affect. But it's not a dramatic number, by the way, right? It's still kind of hovering around 24. So it hasn't plummeted in any way shape or form.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is it more partner mix? Or is it possible that it's more mobile mix like desktop to mobile?","Patrick Pichette","Yes is the short answer. But partners mix affects it as well. Like, it's not only mobile, I guess, is my point. I'll let Susan give you more details on the colors of the -- if any, on the changes that we've done that would have impacted the CPC.","Susan D. Wojcicki","So the 2 biggest factors, as I mentioned, were the FX and also the changes that we made to -- in terms of ad quality or format changes that we made. And those were changes that we made in Q3. There was no, I think, one significant one that drove the metrics. Or like this quarter, we made 20 different changes. Last quarter, we made something similar. And it was the combination of those different changes. Now it's important to remember that we rolled those out over the course of Q3. And so that meant that if we rolled one out at the end of Q3, that you wound up seeing that impact in Q4 period. And so there was a cumulative effect. But again, there was not any one big one. It was the sum of a bunch of other changes. And those changes that we wind up making are changes that may make the ads more readable, they may be more visible, they're UI treatments or quality changes. They're a bunch of different things that make it more visible so that users are noticing the ads. And we see those as positive. We measure the metrics, how do our users respond, how do our advertisers respond. And they are revenue positive.","Patrick Pichette","Yes. Another way to think about this is in many quarters, we would have a bunch of them that would actually move down the CPC, a bunch of them that would have moved up in [ph] click. It just happens that in the latter part of this year, they kind of all moved one way, which is not neither good nor bad. It just happens that the quality team and the advertising teams actually have kind of unearthed these type of opportunities. So it's a bit of circumstantial as well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank Securities.","Jeetil J. Patel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions. First of all, I think, Larry, early on you referred -- you talked about shuttering a couple of products and then doubling on key products that are showing some quite bit of success. I guess can you speak to are you still innovating across new products around the consumer? And anything that's not tied to advertising as we look ahead? Second question, can you talk about -- I guess when you look at mobile distribution costs in general, do you envision a scenario where mobile distribution costs stay about where they are today? Or how do you think those kind of play out over time as you think about the development of the mobile market?","Larry Page","Maybe I'll take the first question and Nikesh can take the second part of the question. I think we -- I didn't mean to imply in any way that we're stopping innovating. And I think we will continue to launch new products in new areas and things that aren't necessarily advertising supported, as we have been doing for a while. And I'm very excited about that. But we may not launch 100 such things. We may launch a few of those such things over the next few years. I think we'll try to make sure we're more concentrated in our efforts to make sure we're producing really amazing products for our users and for our customers that are really well thought out and work really well. And so, I mean, we've put a lot of effort into those things. So we're just really just been concentrating our efforts around our innovation and making sure we're doing a really great job on the things that we really care about and that really matter to the world. And so that's very consistent with sort of everything I\u2019ve said. Nikesh?","Nikesh Arora","Yes, I think on mobile distribution, it's pretty similar to what happens on Search today. Many consumers get their mobile applications from Google directly on their devices. Some people get them through our distribution partners, and some people get them through our carriers. And to be honest, the distribution costs really depend on the mix of those devices. And you can see, traditionally the mix is less and less specific to other distribution partners in the middle, and more and more people are organically getting access to device and applications that they choose given the large plethora of opportunities and options that they have.","Operator","And we'll go to Justin Post, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of things. Patrick, on the hedging program, you had $134 million loss on the expenses of getting the hedges, but you only made $25 million and it was a pretty volatile quarter. Do you have a lot of backlog saved up for next year in profits? And is this working the way you want? And then maybe for Larry, obviously CPC growth is really accelerating. Can you explain why that's good for Google and why you think you're going in the right direction? The mix seems to be a big controversy, but obviously you're making these changes. Can you really explain the positive benefit to the user experience or to the company?","Patrick Pichette","So on the first question, actually thanks for your question, Justin, because I'm sure a lot of people are thinking about that. Our hedges -- so the cost that we accelerated is actually relative to the entire portfolio of hedges that we have that spans over 18 months forward. So what -- think of it as a complete program that extends 18 months out and -- of which think of it like a bond ladder, right, with a lot in the short term and -- less in the long term. All of those hedges, right, you have to mark to market. And when you have to mark to market, they're so much in the money. Then you have to actually accelerate your expensing of them. So you're absolutely right that today as we stand or as we close our books on the 31st, right, they signaled about the weakness of the euro because the euro had lost quite a bit in the quarter and relative to our portfolio. So we would -- if things stayed exactly the same, right, we wouldn't reap a lot of benefits in the coming quarters and wouldn't have those expenses because we took them all in one shot. So I hope that makes sense. And it's really tied to FASB 133 that doesn't allow you to just do it pretty [ph] early.","Larry Page","I can take, say, a little bit about CPC from my perspective. I think -- and I don't have the detail here, quarter or whatever, but I do think that CPCs -- do vary a fair amount, and we're not surprised by that. There are lots of product changes that we can make that can increase CPCs or decrease CPCs and kind of have a -- or an inverse effect on the number of clicks and sort of not change the actual dollars spent, for example. And that's not that surprising because we can do things that -- in product changes that affect people\u2019s attention to ads that Susan mentioned or that affect the quality of the conversions that advertises receive. They might receive better quality clicks, or they're -- or those -- each CPC that they got that's more likely to convert into  what they care about. And so we are constantly optimizing all those things across a number of different product areas and ad placements and everything else. And our advertisers are doing the same, and the algorithms are also doing all that. So I think in any healthy economic -- economy, like we have of advertising, we're going to see variation in the different factors we use to measure it. And I'm not surprised by that.","Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Are you happy with the results in the quarter? Are they going the direction you expected based on the changes you made?","Larry Page","As I said, I'm very happy with our results overall in the quarter. And I think those are a function of all the metrics that we gave you. So yes, I'm happy with our results.","Susan D. Wojcicki","Yes. I mean, one additional thing I'd like to say about the increase in paid clicks is the increase in paid clicks, in a lot of ways, is a proxy for where the ad is useful. Do the users find interesting enough to click on them? Do we have enough advertisers who served ads? So an increase in paid clicks shows that our advertising system is working, that we have more advertisers, we have more clicks. And as Larry alluded to, there are many, many different variables that go into it, but an increase in paid clicks is something that we see as a sign that our advertising system is in demand and it's healthy.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.","Scott W. Devitt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'll ask about paid clicks and their relationship to CPCs. There's a third-party data that suggest that paid clicks continue to grow faster than free clicks. And so the 34% paid click growth that you reported, it would seem to make that fairly accurate that there's a mix shift that's occurring in favor of paid versus free. And with search quality improvements as the driver of this potentially, it would seem that advertisers would be paying more for better distribution, yet CPC is down. So if you were to look at your business on a same distribution basis normalized for mobile and increased ad coverage and all the other potential drags on CPC, I'm just -- the question is a simple one. If you look at advertisers, are they paying more or less on a unit basis for distribution?","Patrick Pichette","I think that -- let we make 2 statements on this. The first one is that we shy from talking about -- anything about specific which is third-party data, because typically we find there are so much errors and methodology issues with them. I think that we're seeing -- what we have clearly seen this year once again, right, is more holiday shopping happened online this year again, right. Nikesh talked about, right, record Cyber Sundays and Fridays that are black. And, I mean, all of these things have hit record year -- this year again, and we're seeing again a transition of off-line to online. I think that Susan's last point is really the critical point, which is as we're moving and exploring formats that really work well for both the advertiser and the user, you should see a symptom which is more clicking. And that's exactly what we see. And if there's a slight pressure on the CPC as a consequence of it, but overall we get a better result, right, that's actually a pretty healthy environment and an innovative one. And then -- and just again, as we mentioned and as Susan said, it happened that in Q3, we had just a number of them that just went one way. And I wouldn't read any data points in that as saying that that's the future or that it will not revert back to others. It's -- that's just the nature of experimentation in our systems.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess I'll spare you on CPC. I have actually a couple of questions for Larry on Google+. Last quarter, I think you referred to it your as social lair. And I guess I almost think of it like Google's -- it's like your social operating system, I guess, to a certain extent. So I'd love to get your vision on how you think G+ can improve engagement across all your properties. And then the second question would be, identities that are on Facebook and Twitter, do you think ultimately those firms will open up the data stream and we could see even richer results with clearly Facebook- and Twitter-like information?","Larry Page","Yes. I think we see -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks that we see really engaging with users on -- really deeply understanding who they are by getting them the right things that make sense for them and so on. It's really, really important. And I think we are at the early stages of that, and Google+ is a big part of that effort. If you look at some of the things we've done, I think that if you look at in Search, you can do a search now and get somebody's name and have that name really appear as a chip in the search. And that means that it's no longer a string that you're searching for, it's actually a real person. That notion of identity is really a deep, deep part of what we're doing. And it's an example of how we can make all of our products better by really understanding people. So we definitely think about that. There's a reason why we called it Google+ in that way. I think -- and so I think you're -- you've got the right idea in general about that. I think that -- I think with other big companies, other big companies that work on social data and so on, I think we've seen very much general tendency to wall that data up and to wall the card in and not make the data available. Where we have publicly been able to access the data -- for example, in Search, we've provided a lot of third-party social data in Search, and we love doing that and we'd love to have more such data. But in general, I would say companies generally have been walling that data up, and we'd love to be able to use more of it.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. Can I maybe ask a follow-up and get a prediction from you in terms of how many G+ users you expect in a year or so?","Larry Page","Oh my goodness, I won't try to predict that. But we're very excited about the growth we had, and we're certainly seeing tremendous number of people being added every day.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.","Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions, neither on CPC. Susan, on Google Offers, quick question there. Given Google [ph] and LivingSocial\u2019s early success in this space, it seemed like scale is an advantage in the local and national deals area. Is there any reason why Google is only in 30 markets to date? It seemed like you've got all the merchant relationships that you need. So is there something else that's preventing a broader rollout? And then a follow-up for Nikesh on Europe. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that Germany was a little weak in the quarter. Can you give us a little color on which verticals? Was it travel, retail, finance? A little color on the verticals that were weak. Or was it broad-based?","Susan D. Wojcicki","So right now, we have 30 markets to date, and that's just what we have to date. So as there are more markets and as it makes more sense for us over time, then we will roll out more markets. But I do think that there is -- it's very important to understand what's working in a specific market and in a city and perfecting that and really understanding the dynamics that make sense for us for the success of that city. And so as we expand, we'll expand with that knowledge. And we'll expand as we -- as it makes sense for us in terms of the users, the solution and building all of those learnings that we've made in those initial 30 markets.","Patrick Pichette","Nikesh, any comments on your side?","Nikesh Arora","Yes, I guess in terms of verticals, generally auto has been strong around the world. We've seen that. And then in different markets, different verticals have been special in terms of the -- the U.S., we had \u2013 education, we had health. So there have been different vertical performances around the world. And Germany has been a market which has been doing really well for us in the last few quarters. So part of it is we're running up against some very, very tough comps versus last year. But it was general sort of weakness across the board. It wasn't specific to any particular vertical that has changed.","Larry Page","I should mention, too, you can actually go to Google Insights for Search, and you can look at our Search free graph over time for any of these verticals yourself. It's some great data.","Operator","And we'll go next to Herman Leung with Susquehanna International Group.","Herman Leung - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. First, I remember last year in the fourth quarter there was a pretty big change that you guys made on the quality side, which I think you mentioned a bit on the prepared remarks. Wondering if that -- how much of a headwind that was relative to the fourth quarter of this year. If there's a way you could sort of quantify that. And second question is the hiring rate that you guys have made, 1,100 people, this quarter. Wondering -- that's a bit of a slowdown from the previous quarters in the past. Wondering if there was something there to look into.","Patrick Pichette","So a 1-2 punch on this one, Herman. On the first one, we mentioned it because we thought it was material. It was such a big impact last year. We don't comment on the specifics, but it was sufficiently material that that's -- you're absolutely right that it created a headwind for us this year. No doubt about it. And that's why we mentioned it. On the second question, you'll remember that in Q3, we kind of had a double hitter where Larry had already said that we had reached what was kind of tolerable in terms of the pace of hiring.","Larry Page","The edge of what\u2019s manageable.","Patrick Pichette","The edge of what is manageable. And thank you, Larry, for that clarification. And we also had at the end of Q3 all of the -- we had the summer -- everybody comes -- leaves -- comes from school, comes into Q3. So we had quite a bit of a bump in Q3. We're really pleased by -- and you can see in our results now that actually, it's a good evidence of we're managing -- we have managed down our numbers into Q4, and a good evidence of we are managing it to make it digestible for us.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Youssef Squali with Jefferies & Company.","Youssef H. Squali - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So first, one product we didn't talk much about is Google Wallet. So I was wondering that based -- if based on your early test, is that a product that you're planning on doubling down on? And if so, what is the path to wider adoption? And second, on MMI, I know the deal hasn't obviously closed yet. But just given the size of that transaction, it certainly has the potential to really change Google's growth and margin profile pretty significantly, which is a big concern to many. So at a very high level, Larry, I was wondering if you could maybe just talk about your commitment to be a principal in the handset business. And if so, how does -- how do you avoid channel conflicts with the partners?","Susan D. Wojcicki","Youssef, this is Susan. So I can talk a little bit about Google Wallet. And so as Larry has mentioned a number of times, we want to focus on products that people use every day. So products that are core. And all of us use our wallet every day. And we think that's a big opportunity for us. So we are continuing to invest in our Wallet business. And we see a lot of opportunity. And for example, there might be opportunities in the future in terms of how online and off-line are linked together, and better opportunities with the way different parts of our business wind up working. So we are very excited about Wallet, and we will continue to invest in it.","Larry Page","And I should mention on Motorola obviously we're going to break that out separately, so you\u2019ll be able to track the changes to margins and so on. I think that -- and able to track the business separately. So that should not be an issue. We've been very clear that Motorola's obviously going to remain a licensee of Android, and Android will remain open. And when we announced the deal, we really said our strategy is working with different manufacturers on lead devices is going to continue. And Motorola will bid with -- just like any other OEM for those devices. So that process will be unchanged. And obviously, I think we have done a great job managing our partner ecosystem. That's a difficult thing to do, and I think we do it quite well. And I expect we're going to continue to do that well with Motorola. And obviously, it shows our commitment to Android in making sure that we have the freedom to innovate and as do all of our OEMs.","Patrick Pichette","So even more specifically, we -- you can expect segmented reporting for Motorola. So the Google will continue to be very clear in terms of its performance and transparency to investors. Motorola will also, on its own, be very clear and transparent to investors. And just before we close the call, just a reminder to everybody, as the headcount question that was asked a minute ago reminded me. As we launch into Q1, it's important to remember that there's a lot of expenses. As people kind of think of resetting their models, it's really -- I just want to remind everybody because every year we go through this, that the employer taxes and 401(k)s and all of the things that launch into Q1 typically get reset. And so I just want to give a friendly reminder to all our -- the people that have financial models out there to make sure that -- to take that into consideration because it surprises everybody every year. So rather than get another surprise at the end of Q1, I just thought I'd remind everyone. On that note, I think it's really -- I'd love to, once again on behalf of the 4 of us here, thank profusely our Googlers. I mean, they do an amazing job and, as we said, landing a great quarter, crowning a terrific year and really well set for an absolute exciting year for 2012 and look forward it. So on that, Jamie, I'll let you close the call.","Operator","Thank you, sir. That does conclude today's conference. We appreciate everyone's participation."],"1337":["Google Inc.

Q1 2014 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jane Penner, Director of IR. Please go ahead ma'am.","Jane Penner","Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Google's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us are Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.","Also as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So, please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call.","You can also visit our Google+ Investor Relations' page for latest company news and updates. Please check it out.","This call is being westbound cast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.","Now, quickly -- now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Please note these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward look statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for more detailed descriptions of the risk factors that may affect our results.","Please note certain financial measures we use on this call such as operating income and operating margin are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and restructuring.","We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.","With that, I will turn the call over to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2014 earnings call.","Before we jump into my usual remarks, I'd like to bring two points to everybody's attention. First, a reminder that on April 2nd, we issued our Class C stock dividend with twice as many shares outstanding, our usual per share information will look quite different starting this quarter.","Also, second, and also as a reminder, our expected sale of the Motorola business -- mobile business to Lenovo triggered discontinued operations accounting treatment which means Motorola's quarterly results are shown separately from Google net income. You'll see this new presentation in our financials starting this quarter.","So with these two caveats noted let's dive into the details of Google's financial performance in Q1. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 19% year-over-year to $15.4 billion and it was down 2% quarter-over-quarter.","Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would in fact have been 21% year-over-year. Google sites revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $10.5 billion and was down 1% quarter-over-quarter driven by the strength in our core search advertising business.","Network revenue was up 4% year-over-year at $3.4 billion and was down 4% quarter-over--quarter driven by improved year-over-year growth from our Ad Exchange and AdMob businesses.","Finally, Google's other revenue grew 48% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and was down 6% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play Store drove year-over-year growth. Chromecast sales were also strong.","Our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter again up 26% year-over-year and down just 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost per click was down 9% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter.","Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q1 CPC growth. Our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by a number of factors discussed on previous calls, including geographic mix, device mix, property mix as well as products and policy changes.","And to help investors better understand the complex dynamics of these monetization metrics, we'll begin disclosing paid clicks and CPC growth by property in Q2.","To be clear this means we'll disclose CPC and paid click growth rates for both our sites and network businesses. We will continue to disclose aggregate growth rates for CPC and paid clicks.","Turning to the geographic performance, we saw strong performance in the U.S. and rest of world, solid performance in our U.K. In our earnings slides, which you can find in our Investor Relations' website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and rest of world, to show the impact of FX and benefits from our hedging program. So, please refer to those slides for the exact calculation.","U.S. revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $6.7 billion, the U.K. was up 14% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and in fixed FX terms, it grew 11% year-over-year.","Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. was up 25% year-over-year to $7.2 billion. This accounted for 47% of our total revenue, which includes a $8 million benefit from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of world grew, in fact, 30% year-over-year.","Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.2 billion or 23% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.6 billion in Q1, excluding our stock-based compensation.","Non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.6 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation and as a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was $5 billion and our non-GAAP operating margins were 32% in Q1.","Just a quick word on a few items that may have created noise in our operating expenses this quarter. We had some discrete legal expenses that hit our G&A line as well as one-time M&A related costs that increased our operating expenses, particularly in R&D. So, absent these discrete items, our expenses continue to demonstrate the same disciplined agenda we've always had.","Headcount was up, roughly 2,100 people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 50,000 full-time employees and please note that the headcount still includes approximately 3,700 full-time employees from the Motorola business as well as the employees from the acquisition completed in this quarter.","Our effective tax rate was 18% in Q1 and our tax rate this quarter was impacted obviously by the federal R&D credits, which expired in 2013.","Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $357 million for the quarter and realized gains on investments and interest income, offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging program. For more details on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.","We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $4.4 billion. CapEx for the quarter was 2.3 billion this quarter; again the majority of CapEx was related to data center construction, production equipment, and real estate purchases.","As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest in the long-term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area of investment for us. Our free cash flow was $2 billion for Q1.","And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. Motorola had a great quarter in Q1 with the Moto G showing strong sales momentum especially in emerging markets. The team continues to be hard at work and we look forward to seeing them join up with Lenovo soon.","So, there you have it, strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities including Android, Chrome, YouTube, enterprise just to name a few.","And now I'll cover more details -- I'll let Nikesh, in fact, cover more details of our business performance in the quarter and after his remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for questions. Here you go Nikesh.","Nikesh Arora","Thank you, Patrick. You're welcome to cover more details if you'd like.","Our business is growing well, with $15.4 billion in gross revenue; we had a particularly good advertising performance in the United States, highlighted by very strong auto sector showing around the Super Bowl. We had strong Play growth in Asia and we had a few isolated tracks.","By now you're aware of the four areas driving our business. The first one direct sponsor, or as I like to call it performance marketing; the second one helping clients build their brands; third our ad tech platform for publishers and agencies; and fourth, our emerging businesses like digital content, enterprise, and hardware.","Let me give you an you an update on all of those and talk about industry trends that are driving the investments we're making. On performance advertising, people are now always online and they want seamless, easy experience as they move from screen-to-screen.","This constant connectivity is driving our investments here as people use search to navigate their world, Google is well-positioned to help people navigate between web, apps and the places around them. They help the marketers measure the entire customer journey and to drive better monetization.","Next week, we'll be welcoming hundreds of advertisers to our adverse performance forum where we'll talk more about our work in this area for marketers. But clients are already benefiting from our recent investments like enhanced campaign and estimated total conversion.","For instance, Shutterfly recently began measuring cross device conversion networks to understand sales that start in one device and end on another. As a result, they saw 60% increase in mobile conversions for non-brand terms, leaving them to include 100% of their keywords on mobile devices.","We're seeing great momentum in product listing adds as well, with a new shop in campaign system. International retailer Farfetch upgraded shopping campaigns and increased their conversion rate by 13% while reducing cost there per acquisition or CPA by 20%.","And Domino's Pizza -- who doesn't like pizza, recently made it easy for customers to pay with Google Wallet, instant buy in their in Android app.","Moving on to brand building. For years you've all seen the rise of digital video, over-the-top networks, connected screens, streaming devices and high quality digital programming. Already for example, YouTube reaches more than 1 billion people a month through usually popular channels like fashion guru, Bethany Mota; cooking maven, Rosanna Pansino; and cult hit Nerdist.","For marketers this is an irresistible trend, and we're now at a significant industry moment. Marketers and agencies that have historically built their brand on TV are reorienting their creative, planning, and investments with digital at the center.","This year nearly all Super Bowl advertisers turned to YouTube to extend the life and reaches of their TV spots and Super Bowl related ads on YouTube have been viewed over 300 million times. That's roughly three times the size of the audience that watch the ads on TV.","In Australia, we work with Nissan to create made for YouTube video for the launch of their new Patrol SUV. The campaign which is promoted by TrueView ads and YouTube mass set for over 340% increase of daily visits to their websites, and more than 2% of those were interactive for the campaign booked a test drive.","In a few weeks in New York at our annual Brandcast Upfront Event we'll focus on our new Google preferred offering. This features exclusive access to the best, most engaging content on YouTube with guaranteed audiences through third-party measurement providers, Neilson and Counselor. We're really excited about this and we're looking forward to the results of that Upfront Brandcast Event.","We're also helping brands through our newest display ad formats. We recently teamed with Tory Burch to bring her New York Fashion Week Show to a global audience across our display network. Then also the first ever live stream of fashion show in an ad using a light box ads, and we're able to share the exclusive event with more than 7 million of their biggest fans.","Third, moving to our ad technologies and platforms; our programmatic ad technologies are seeing -- are continue to see great momentum with premium publisher partners like The Local Media Consortium.","That's comprised more than 800 daily newspapers and 200 local broadcast stations as well as timing. Both of them signed on with us in February to create private exchanges. This maximizes a value of that ad space for handpicked premium environment.","One thing we know is that agencies and publishers want to trust the environment in which they're transacting. Our ad network and exchanges are widely regarded across the industry as having the best quality controls and we continue to invest here.","In February we acquired wellium fraud fighter Spider.io and thousands of our clients are already using our MRC-accredited Active View technology to buy high-quality viewable ad impressions.","Let me switch over to our emerging new businesses, digital content, hardware and enterprise. Google Play continues to be the thriving hub of our digital content business. This quarter we introduced Google Play movies to 39 new countries, so now people in more than 65 countries can enjoy movies through Play.","We also teamed up with Sonos to bring high-fidelity play music into the home and we introduce new development tools for Google Play games including game gifting and iOS multiplayer support.","Over 75 million new users joined Google Play games in last six months; all of this is helping turn developers around the world into full-fledged businesses. In fact, we paid out more than four times as much money to developers in 2013 compared to 2012.","And following the Open Automotive Alliance that we announced with partners in January designed to bring android as a car, in March we've announced Android Wear, a project that extends android to wearables.","We're also already working with several consumer electronics manufacturers, chip makers and fashion brands who can't wait to see what developers come up with for your wrist.","We also continue to see strong momentum from our suite of hardware products, our $35 Chromecast is a real hit. Last month we brought Chromecast to 11 more countries. We also recently opened up Chromecast developers, and in just a few weeks, more than 3,000 developers worldwide sign up to bring their apps and websites to the platform.","Turning over to enterprise. We continue to see strong product adoption around the globe. We launched Chromebox for meetings, which makes it easy for any company to have high-definition video meetings through the power of Google+ Hangouts and Google apps.","We're also investing significantly in the Google cloud platform and I've seen a very positive response to our most recent product announcements.","We expect to see continued momentum in this area and we believe we can bring significant value to the many companies that opting public cloud because of our experience in building and operating one of the world's largest cloud computing environments for over a decade.","We able to pass on the savings that come from lower digital storage cost to our customers through highly competitive pricing. In addition, every day more businesses, governments and schools start using Google apps to work better together including the state of Sao Paulo who moved to Google apps for more than 4 million students and 300,000 teachers and staff.","Before I close, I want to call out our marketing team who continues to highlight the magic of Google to beep around the world, into fourth annual Google Science Fair, the doodle for Google in United States, the hugely popular ad campaigns.","They also helped to build great retail experience for Chromecast in over 6,000 stores. I'd like to thank all Googlers around the world who help makes a terrific quarter.","I'll now hand over back to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Nikesh. So we'll work with Jamie to go straight to the Q&A. Jamie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie","Patrick, I was wondering if you could help us quantify some of the expenses you saw, the one-time nature of G&A and anything else there that was really one-time. Just to help us understand what that run rate would look like if that wasn't in there?","And then maybe the cash, if you could talk about the theme of sort of advertising attribution and how that's going to help you potentially bring over more brand dollars, and how do you think about bringing over those television dollars.","I mean is that something that's going to come sort of a big rushing in 2014, or it's just going to be a slow evolution over many years. Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Great. Thanks Ben. When I start, look on the discrete legal expense that impacted, it really impacted our G&A if -- and then the one-time M&A deal cost impacted all of our operating lines, but most prominently our R&D line, which you'll notice will have jumped a bit.","The one-time M&A deal costs are largely stemming from the Nest deal, which was a pretty large transaction for us this quarter, but I think that the best way to describe it is that our expenses in Q1, they are completely in line with our objectives if you'd kind of take apart these two items, so that's how I would describe it. Nikesh?","Nikesh Arora","In terms of brand benefit Ben, I think -- thank you Patrick, thank you Ben. The brand question is a very good question. What we've noticed in the past let's just say 1.5 year is that people have slowly started coming to the digital medium to create extensional the existing brand campaigns like I mentioned the Super Bowl ad. People come to YouTube and say I'd like to read certain audiences which are only available on digital medium hence we see those advertising dollars shifting as an enhancing existing television or media campaigns.","Now the real fun will began when people start doing campaigns exclusively on digital to go and help them build brands. That requires us to get ahead of the curve and get into the creative process much earlier because usually what we end up doing now is we get up -- we get to the end of the period of process and they just want to extend their brand.","So we're working really hard to work with creative ad agencies, the large agency groups as well as our advertisers say how can we get ahead of that creative process, how can we help you conceive of brand campaigns that actually start and end in digital where perhaps you use TV as an extension medium as oppose to the other way around.","Now I think this is definitely the Holy Grail. This is going to take us a level of time to get there, but with things like attribution in place with our deals with Nielsen and comScore we're beginning to create the compatibility saying look the same dollar you spend on television equates to so many dollars on digital or vice versa.","The fact that we can give them sort of cross media measurement capability, we can give them comfort that their dollars are being well spent, even spent in digital. We will go long way in making sure that we get them to transition from just using traditional media to including digital in their media mix and eventually designing campaigns that start and end up digital.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Nikesh. Jamie, let's go to our next question. Thank you, Ben for your question.","Operator","And we'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two things I wanted to ask. First, Patrick, just on the U.S. you had commented on the strength here in terms of 14% year-over-year, but it does look like on a sequential basis we saw a little bit more of a DeSale have been in recent 1Qs. Can you just comment if there's any factors there to point out.","And then Nikesh, can you just talk about the key drivers of mobile pricing going forward. How you think the gap can close with desktop over the coming quarters and years. Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","All right. Thanks for -- Doug, for your questions. So in the case of the U.S. if you think about it you have the Q4 to Q1 issues that are typical. And then, as we've said before, the network business does skew toward the U.S. on a relative basis, so network clearly grew slower than site.","So that's what really what you see is that mix of the two, but in aggregate, right, pretty pleased with the U.S. growth overall. So that was a pretty strong quarter. I'm really happy with it. Well, let Nikesh answer the mobile questions.","Nikesh Arora","Yeah, Doug, I think thank you again for the question. I've had firm belief and I continue to hold on to it that I believe in the medium to long term. Mobile pricing has to be better than desktop pricing. And I think the reason -- the way to think about it is that in mobile you have location and you have context of individuals which you don't have on the desktop.","And the more you known about the user and their context, the more effective advertising you can provide to them. The better the conversion is likely to be for a search or any piece of advertising that you do. There's a whole bunch of building blocks that need to come into play for us like you said to get the gap to close.","The good news is a lot of people are spending a lot of time on mobile devices. There's a lot of mobile search queries that we get. People are more and more focused about what they look for in mobile devices. They are closer to intent. They are closer to transaction.","You see that there's a lot of friction-less ways of paying and converting transactions into commerce which is happening but things like instant buy etcetera. You're also seeing the lot of advertisers seemed through value of making sure that their present and a great experience on the mobile devices.","So part of our challenge has been that if you guys just huge massive advertise in the desktop which over the last decade have become better at advertising, Understanding, optimization, understanding conversion, understanding truncation.","That journey is just beginning for advertisers in the mobile site. They're just beginning to understand what it takes for the end user to come transact on their website.","So like right now we can leave the horse to the water, we can't make it drink. But with all the advertisers coming on-board and working with us, we are actually begging to show them real transactions and asset beings to gain traction. I think we begin to see that gap continue to converge.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan","Thanks you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks Doug for your question. Jamie let's go to the next question.","Operator","I'm going to go to next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thanks guys. I had a question on the Google Play App Store revenues and Nikesh you just mentioned that you guys paid out 300% more revenue to developers in \u201913 versus \u201912.","So, I guess, how much is Play contributing to the overall licensing and other line, and there is clearly some lines or some items in that line that are not growing nearly as fast to get to the current 48% average. So can you talk about maybe what's underperforming in that area?","And then last question on this topic is, I think if you go back to the infamous Andy Rubin slides from the Oracle case, the revenue share was around 5% for Google Play App Store revenue share, where is that now and is it changing as the Android ecosystem gets larger?","Patrick Pichette","Thanks. So why don\u2019t I take a shot at this. Ross, the \u2013 if you think of our other revenue estimates for this quarter, right \u2013 first of all its \u2013 we\u2019re really delighted by the Play business. So \u2013 and you\u2019ll remember that a year ago we had \u2013 I mean, I'm going to bring back everybody to Q1 of 2013.","We had a lot of Nexus 4 hardware sales, because we were in stock out in Q4. And that in combination with the accounting change of our Play app content revenue recognition. Again, remember till Q1 of last year both just simply created a bit of tougher year-over-year comp for this quarter, but overall very pleased with all of the kind of big lines of growth in this space.","As for the rev share, I mean, obviously, this accounting change kind of goes to this 30% rather than the what you would have seen before which would have the net and \u2013 but we don\u2019t divulge with the percentages are, that we keep going forward.","So that\u2019s basically where we stand on it and that\u2019s why we are pretty pleased with this line for this quarter.","Nikesh Arora","And if I can add to Patrick, I think, the important part is, it\u2019s taken us a while to get all the capabilities in place around the world in different markets, making sure we have all the content we need, we have all the app providers we need as well as the we have the payment mechanism. So, we really are excited about the Google Play business going forward.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thanks guys.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks. Thanks, Ross. Jamie lets go to our next question.","Operator","And we will go next to Mark May with Citi.","Mark May - Citigroup","Thanks. A question regarding the CPC segmentation for next quarter. Why you may not be in a position to provide these specific data points for Q1. I was hoping that maybe you could give us directionally how CPCs have trended between the owned and network businesses and kind of what are your expectation is going forward? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","So, Mark, you will get the information in Q2. What we really wanted to do with the recognition as we think about giving more transparency to our shareholders, just looking at having exactly as you just mentioned the split between kind of our core sites and then the network itself.","I think it will be useful for everybody and then, obviously, we will have the information going forward.","So a lot of insights are going to come out of that and we are very pleased to be able to share with you starting next quarter. We've just made this decision over the last little while and shared it with the Audit Committee, the Board, so just stay tuned for next quarter on it.","Mark May - Citigroup","There are number of dynamics that play into the blended CPC that you've called out before property, policy, geo and device among others. Once you provide this new layer of transparency, does that really capture the major -- is it really the property and maybe to some degree policy differences that are influencing CPCs between owned and network or will geo and devices continue to play a major role in reported CPC, even once you provide this extra segmentation?","Patrick Pichette","Well, they all will and if we do \u2013 we may change just the policies that effect network, you will see them much more in transparent way. So in that sense it\u2019s a very positive kind of news.","Whether devices kind of have effects on network versus others, you will \u2013 it will be much more difficult to see. But, clearly, the impacts that are driven specifically for network or for sites you will be able to see on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So I think that\u2019s good news for our investors.","All right. Thank you so much for your question, Mark. Jamie, why don\u2019t we go to our next question, please?","Operator","And we will go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Two questions on the U.K. revenue growth at 11% number and on the partner websites at 4%, is there anything you would want to call out that has been unusual drags on those growth rates? I think U.K. is the lowest we've seen and maybe just lot of large numbers and really successful execution of that market. But anything you want to call out for either of those two revenue streams. Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Well, as I said, well let me start with the U.K. The U.K., look, combination of partner mix this quarter, as well as, again, year-over-year matters a lot and we have happen to have a year ago a real revenue favorable weather.","I mean, people kind of tend to forget it, but last year we had a very strong Q1 for the U.K. and the combination of these two things just kind of year-over-year made the comparison a little tighter for this quarter.","As it relates to websites \u2013 partner websites, I covered that a bit earlier. And we\u2019re \u2013 I mean, again, you back to last year where network, if you think about Ad Exchange, that model change in that model continues to be very, very strong.","And we will remember again last year that we started the DLA policy change in Q1 or maybe it was in Q4, but the impact of the DLA actually takes time to flow through.","We said that would take multi quarters. So, this has not kind of float over completely. So what you have again there is very strong on the quarters where we want sort of the Ad Exchange and AdMob, but on the flipside of that, right, you still have the tails of the DLA change policy that\u2019s for a year ago. But the effects have not fully flowed through, so even in the coming quarters you should see a bit of an effect there, but, overall, pretty pleased with actually these results, Mark.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we go next to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Thank you. I have two questions. First, in the last eight quarters headcount has grown significantly slower than revenue, but this quarter you hired, I think, 2,300 people in the core and headcount grew its revenues. Was this change in hiring rate mostly because of acquisitions and marginally what prevents you from hiring 2,300 people a quarter or even more as the business grows?","And secondly, Patrick, in the spirit of giving more transparency to shareholders, can you give us some color on what has driven such a sustained increase in CapEx over the last four quarters?","Because, I \u2013 I think clearly it\u2019s not just some lumpy behavior. Are you buying data center sites in advance of demand and if this is the case can we infer that CapEx will revert to historical levels. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Carlos for both of these questions. So, to the headcount question, I think, you've basically nailed it intuitively, which is, the acquisition of Nest \u2013 the acquisitions this quarter had a quite a bit of people impact on this number. Or kind of if you think of our organic numbers, have actually not changed in any material way.","So it just happened, you know, you buy Nest and it comes with a lot of people. We also had, you remember, the acquisition of DeepMind and few others. So for us we had the double hitter of having the opportunity to continue to attract people on an organic basis to our processes and these few acquisitions kind of moved the needle quite a bit for us this quarter.","As it relates to CapEx, listen, you are right that we \u2013 and I've mentioned this in the last couple of quarters, where we have \u2013 and just a reminder to everybody, if you think of the CapEx categories, right, data centers first, and data construction then production equipment then all other facilities, it\u2019s kind of like the hierarchy of needs.","And in the case of data center construction, we have found that the option value of having more capacity on standby and available to us to grow versus not having it is actually a real strategy issue for the company and in that sense if for whatever reason we continue \u2013 we had a spike in demand that was really pronounced and sustained for a couple of quarters and we did not have the capacity, it would be a real issue strategically for us, relative to the quite low cost of having the infrastructure in place.","So that\u2019s why we\u2019re really pushing ahead of the curve and so it\u2019s with this view of long-term. So from that perspective you are also right that that\u2019s the mindset we are applying and we've always said that CapEx was lumpy, so you have a good manifestation of it right now, right here. So thank you for you those two questions, Carlos.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Cheers. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we will go next to Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse","Hey, thanks guys. So, Nikesh, so in order to attract greater brand advertising dollars, it seems like safety and context are also important factors, because you are certainly not falling short on reads.","So how close do you think you are to either engineering or coming up with some sort of solution to contextualize all the video content on YouTube, so you can guarantee you advertisers brand safety? Thanks","Nikesh Arora","That\u2019s a good question. I think as I alluded to, we are going to do an upfront in a few weeks in New York City called Google Preferred, which is sort of our way of trying to create a premium sort of concentration of content that we can have advertisers advertise against which gives them a higher level of brand safety, a better level of measurement and hopefully plays where they believe that they can actually build the brands and hopefully that will \u2013 that will manifest itself in our ability to have a premium compared to what we can attract to the market without providing those kinds of things. So that\u2019s a very good question. I think that\u2019s what we are hoping to achieve and stay tuned for our detailed announcement of Brandcast.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse","Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks Stephen. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. I have three quick things. Did Enhanced Campaigns which you rolled out over the summer, impact Q4 and do you see some more benefits coming this year?","Second, on PLAs, we think you had very good success in the U.S. in Q4, did that \u2013 does that, do you still have some benefits to come from that as you roll that out in Europe. How are you looking at the timing there versus how you rolled that out in the U.S.?","And finally in the first quarter, maybe you can call out some specific verticals that might have strong or weak for you. Thank you.","Nikesh Arora","That\u2019s a good question, Justin. Thank you. Not sure I can give you a lot of detail in terms of precise impacts of any individual products that we have. But, Enhanced Campaigns are working. It\u2019s a necessity that we have to do them both for process reasons as well as the reason that consumers are going from screen to screen as well as advertisers need to advertise across multiple screens.","So from that perspective Enhanced Campaigns is working, it\u2019s part of life here. We don\u2019t do anything without Enhanced Campaigns across the board. It\u2019s sort of gone from being Enhanced Campaigns to regular campaigns because we don\u2019t have any unenhanced campaigns anymore.","In terms of PLAs, it\u2019s something, as I alluded, is actually working. It\u2019s providing a lot of color in the shopping vertical. It\u2019s providing a lot of hold in shopping campaign effort that we have. PLA is working for us and its sort of working from multiple perspectives.","It is providing users the detailed information that they need when they are declaring intent and saying and I would like to search for particular product, please don\u2019t send to me to website.","So it is working. We are going to roll that out one, separate time around the world. I cannot comment on the timing exactly. But I think both of those things are having a positive impact in our minds to everything we are doing around here.","Patrick Pichette","Just to close on this, just a few verticals here. I mean, again, completely reflecting the economy around us. If you go to \u2013 automobile has been quite strong across the world. Travel, actually quite strong in the U.S., so in the U.K. as well as in the rest of the world, a little bit less in the U.S, but just to give you a sense of. And then real estate, clearly, in the U.S. has been a strong vertical as well as in the U.K, so, again, a good reflection of the economy there, Justin.","So, Google Trends, I always encourage people to go and checkout Google Trends as well because they continue to give good insights as to what's going on in the economy which would mirror in terms of verticals.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks Patrick. Thanks Nikesh.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks Justin. Jamie, let\u2019s go to your next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric Sheridan - UBS","Thanks for taking the question guys. So two ones. One for Nikesh. Nikesh, I would love to get your view on sort of your view of the travel industry. Sort of how are you approaching that industry as a participant from an economy basis in that industry, both the marketing funnel and potentially the booking funnel? Longer term there\u2019s been a lot sort of written lately about the way in which you guys might approach that industry vertical.","And then second, Patrick for you. Maybe taking a stab at the one-time expenses from a different approach, when we look at the model, if you take your comments before about sort of smoothing out the expenses we saw in the back part of the year and even year-over-year, it appears that one-time expenses might have been about 50 basis point to 100 basis point impact on each of those two lines which would have sort of brought the blended number back up to sort of somewhere between 75 basis point to 150 basis points on margins. But just want to take a stab at that from a different direction just to quantify it. Thanks guys.","Nikesh Arora","Thanks Eric. That\u2019s for the question. I was actually talking about pulling up the article which recently -- were Darren Huston talked about the effectiveness of Google Advertising for price line. I think that\u2019s a public endorsement that all our efforts in the last many years in rather travel industry are actually working.","They see tremendous value in our ability to help them bring more travelers to their sites and for them to help convert them into a real transaction. So whatever we are doing is working.","I think I am expecting \u2013 suspecting that the comments we are talking about is our continued efforts in providing more and more detailed information when people do searches. And as we've talked in the past before that people\u2019s information needs are getting more precise and we have to keep evolving the results at Google, whether its knowledge cards or Google Now all the things that we do towards giving them more and more precise answers, in which case sometimes we are required to go work with various industries to get the underlying data to surface it when the users are looking as opposed to send them to other sites where they have to go through that search process again.","So I think you can expect us to continue do that. But our intent there is to provide a better answer for the users, whether it\u2019s on their desktop or mobile devices. Accordingly, we also working together with the advertisers to provide them various advertising opportunities which allow them to work effectively with the end-user and provide them the answers that they are looking for or perhaps in this case the ticket or the hotel booking that they are looking for.","Patrick Pichette","Great. And then on my side, Eric, look, as I said in my earlier comment, our Q1 expenses were completely in line with our objectives and there is always seasonality.","As you've noticed, from Q4 to Q1 there is always \u2013 we spend less on marketing and so that\u2019s true for this year as well. And for the other areas, right, we would have been in line with the objectives we've set for ourselves. So these one-time costs were genuinely and that\u2019s where truly one-time.","And \u2013 I mean, when you acquire Nest for bit over $3 billion, there is just a lot of stuff that flows through the P&L, lot of accounting, and so that\u2019s really the issue there. So, I would go back to your instinct of at least kind of we should be roughly in line with what our expectations where and they \u2013 that\u2019s why the nature of truly extraordinary items. So thanks for that question.","Eric Sheridan - UBS","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we will go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Why don\u2019t you revisit attributions for a moment? Given aspects attribution and I think you guys are doing a great job on the cross screen attribution and taking advantage of your ubiquitous login across different platforms and Enhanced Campaigns.","Wanted to get a better understanding of how you\u2019re thinking about online versus offline attribution for those types of marketers, particularly brand advertisers, supermarket advertisers, the 30,000 SKUs and those retail channels that don\u2019t have E-Commerce and really don\u2019t have much of the search opportunity. How are you helping them close the gap between their online activity and offline sales? Thanks very much.","Nikesh Arora","Thanks Peter. Thanks again for the question. I think as you rightfully pointed out the attribution story on the advertising side is kind of becoming clearer as we partner with Nielsen and comScore, and adopted some of the mechanisms that traditional media has used to create the comparability between traditional and internet media.","I think you identity a good challenge which is that how do we bridge the gap between online commerce and offline commerce and relate that to advertising opportunity, i.e. when we sell search, we sell traffic to different people, how do we convince them, how do we make them realize that that traffic that they\u2019ve got normally results in online sales, but also results in offline sales at stores and how do we encourage that activity.","So over the last many years around the world we have run specific studies, working with various advertisers which are called online to store studies where we actually try and measure what online activity created by them took to control group's results in more foot traffic in their particular stores and certain reasons about. And we've pretty much had very good results across the board.","I can't detail specifics right now because they are all specific to individual advertisers who we work with. But we do understand that opportunity and the problem and we work specifically with third-party research teams to work on figuring out how do we keep showing the online to store efficacy. And there are other products as you can see where we start doing conversion, we start looking at things like Google Shopping which also helps us in those areas.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks again, Peter.","Peter Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks for the color.","Patrick Pichette","Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we will go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to go back to an earlier question there was \u2013 you responded about the building blocks that were needed in order to get mobile pricing, mobile CPCs to convert to desktop.","I was just wondering if you could share with us kind of specifically what you think those building blocks are that need to happen over the medium to long-term as you said to see that conversions occur. Thank you.","Nikesh Arora","Of course, thanks Heather for the question. I mean, look, there were some very simple things and there are some complicated things. The simple things are, we will make sure that there is payment enablement for users.","So i.e. users have a mechanism that allows them to pay with lowest amount of friction, because honestly you and I don\u2019t want to spend our lives trying to enter payment information on a very small screen where you are trying to conduct the transaction. So that enablement is happening across the industry, across multiple payment platforms.","There is also the need that when people search for some things they can get quickly down to the information and they don\u2019t have to browse multiple sites, because people are more keen on declaring intent to mobile devices than going and searching multiple websites and trying to figure out what they are trying to do.","And that intent could be in the form of restaurant, could be in the form of a taxi, could be in the form of them looking for individual product. And you are beginning to see apps, you are beginning to see solutions on search that allow you to get to that granularity of information.","Of course, there is a big building block which is getting all the people out there which shows the advertisers effectively in this case the merchants who actually have to have experience in the mobile site which are simpler to execute on.","So try buying something on many companies\u2019 mobile websites and it's more own risk than their desktop sites because they've been spending a decade trying to optimize the desktop site, but they haven\u2019t spent enough time optimizing mobile experience, in some cases not believing that people want to transact with them in a mobile device and some cases they are just slow and they are just slowly diverting resources from desktop to mobile.","So, if you take all those things and take the notion that we need to keep sort of working hard towards getting these building blocks in place, I think there's a finite time where these building blocks will come into plays.","And as they keep coming into plays, you will see or as we talked about earlier, perhaps the conversion will happen between pricing in mobile desktop. But there's a whole bunch of other issues, I think but those are the big things that we need to think of right there.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks for your question Heather. Jamie let's go to our next question please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.","Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great thanks. I wanted to ask you a question on the cloud platform. Since this is obviously a huge revenue opportunity for you and first-off if you could put context around the impact of this business on CapEx and OpEx, particularly on the infrastructure of the service part of the business?","And then secondly, if you could talk about how you're planning to differentiate the service, is it really about pricing or is it by tying in the software and platform as a service offering, if you could touch on that? Thanks very much.","Patrick Pichette","I can cover the first part and then I'll let Nikesh cover the second. Look we're very comfortable with our cost structure. In light of Google efficiencies, economies of scale, our vertical integration from data center to chip -- to servers, to software. I mean we really have -- we believe we have absolute unique position from a cost structure perspective and therefore, from a margin perspective makes us very, very comfortable.","In terms of differentiation, I'll just let Nikesh jump in here.","Nikesh Arora","I think Colin -- thank you again for the question. The important part to at least acknowledge in the space of cloud computing is we think that it's very, very, very early days. I mean if you think about the potential scope and scale of what this opportunity is, that's pretty much every business which is going to be around for the long-term has to operate in the cloud.","There's no efficiency compared to the efficiency of the cloud, but in compared to owning your own infrastructure running it by yourself. So, this shift is going to happen. It\u2019s a matter of every company going through that shift one at a time. And if you look at the opportunities out there and the options, there's very few options.","So, there's a lot of room for all of us to have a great time for many, many, many years before we start worrying about differentiation and why my sort of thing is better than yours.","So, right now, the key is to be able to work with the companies out there, the enterprise customers out there to get them to shift on the legacy systems, get on to the cloud and realize that Google has been working in the cloud for more than a decade, because we have been running one of the largest cloud computing platforms in the world in the public space. And we have all of the expertise and skills that are required to be able to serve these enterprises and get them off their current legacy system onto the cloud.","So, our effort is really trying to work with each of these third-party partners, trying to get them off the legacy systems onto our cloud. I don't think the challenge right now is the need to differentiate. I think our biggest differentiator is we have the most experience in the space.","Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks Colin. Jamie we'll go to our next question please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jordan Monahan with Morgan Stanley.","Jordan Monahan - Morgan Stanley","Hi, thank you for taking the question. Actually two if I may. A couple of big picture questions, I think for Nikesh. The first is I think there's an ongoing debate about whether mobile web or mobile app is going to win and what the implications are for various businesses, Google included?","And I'm just curious to get your view on whether you think one will win over the other and then whether it matters for Google?","And then the second is when you look at Google's share of global advertising, you're coming up on about 10% of total, but when you look at your business in the U.K., you're north of 20% of total.","So, when you think about your global businesses as economies start to mature, do you think the U.K. is a fair proxy for thinking about your business globally or are there other factors that you think may prevent you from getting to that type of scale globally.","Nikesh Arora","I guess let me answer the second question first Jordan, because I'm standing here Patrick is looking at me asking the same question. I think the way to think about it is that we have 10% by some metric depending on what we believe the total is.","As per your metric, we have 10% of the total advertising sort of money. And the U.K. we have 20%. That just tells me there's 90% more opportunity around the world and 80% more opportunity in the U.K.","So, we're not going to constrain our thinking in terms of what believe is a stable state. Our aspiration is to be able to serve every advertiser in the long-term and our aspiration is that -- our hope is that every piece of advertising becomes digital advertising.","The question is how much of that are we able to provide through our technology platforms, how much are we able to provide through our own sort of properties and how much do we partner with others to provide on their network.","So, I guess I'm trying to tell you we don't constrain ourselves and our thinking. I'm not trying to be arrogant, say we want 100%, but we like more than what we have in every market out there.","In terms of your question around the mobile web and mobile search, that is a tough question and that is a very involved question and I think the approach -- the best way to think about it is that we're trying to make sure we can make both of them effective for the end-user and make them both work, because we're not about to try and pick winners.","Right now, you can see that people spend as much time on mobile devices -- more time mobile devices they are beginning to spend on the desktop and they are spending the time across the mobile web as well as mobile app landscape.","We're participating in both those ecosystems, whether it's somewhere placed on the app front, whether it's through our browser-based search properties or through our app-based search properties. So, we're participating across the Board and I think at the end of the day, it's going to boil down to ease-of-use and consumer choice.","Jordan Monahan - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Jordan. Let's go to our next question please Jamie.","Operator","And we'll go next to Robert Peck with SunTrust.","Robert Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions if you don't mind. The first is on the revenue side, can you talk a little bit -- can you maybe give us an update about the breakout of YouTube versus DoubleClick revenues, where are those today and where could they be over time?","And then on the cost side, Patrick could you just walk us through just how you think about the ROI on capital? We get a lot of questions from investors asking about spending, could you maybe tell us more about the thought process and how the company looks at the ROIC of capital going forward? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Okay, well Robert, let's start with the last one first and then we'll go back to revenue. ROI clearly we have -- we always look at capital intensity. The fact that we're investing quite a bit in CapEx right now is a real tribute to kind of the potential and the optimism we have about our businesses going forward.","Most of our core businesses if you think of YouTube or advertising or search are not that capital-intensive relative to other areas that we have such as for example, Google Fiber, if you think of the access portion right which is much more traditional CapEx.","For each of these areas, we actually track and make sure that we have good returns and we have a capital efficient. So even though an area that take the advertising business that we run, even though you could argue that it's phenomenally good on return on capital, the questions that we will ask internally is okay so if the utilization rate is X on our machines on this business, right, why can't it be X plus something?","So, even though we have already good return on capital in these areas, we continue to always push the envelope to make sure that our capital efficiency continues to be better and better on a year-to-year basis and then across a portfolio, every area has some capital kind of targets to make sure that we're driving for value.","Finally, there's a number of areas if you think of take the newer stuff like Loon, for example. In those cases, you test through the hurdles that we kind of we seed capital to the Loon team as they hid their hurdles and they kind of earned their right to the next cost for funding.","And in doing so, right, we continue to always have the business case in mind that says here is why this continues to make sense to fund and invest and with an ROIC or value in mind for the long-term, but in the short-term, it's really kind of delivery of milestones on very specific engineers objectives that actually gives them the next round of funding.","So, Robert as you can see, given the portfolio of mature stuff we have and growing areas as well as kind of much more R&D and innovation at the early stages, right, we just need to have a basket of tools to actually manage the concept of ROIC or ROI on each of them. And that's what we do. It's not rocket science; it just requires a lot of discipline on our part.","On the revenue side, look, we don't break out DoubleClick or YouTube. I can just tell you as I mentioned a bit earlier; we're really pleased with our network revenue in the kind of AdMob, AdExchange. Many of our areas continue to grow very well and we're very, very pleased by these investments and clearly continue to be very pleased with YouTube as mentioned -- Nikesh mentioned a bit earlier.","Robert Peck - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you very much.","Patrick Pichette","That's the story there. Thank you. Jamie, we'll take one last question. We're running out of time. So, we'll take one last question if you don't mind.","Operator","And our final question comes from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffrey.","Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray","Hey, good afternoon. Another question regarding trends and mobile CPC. Yesterday you announced an offline conversion tracking plan and program with Datalogic. Is that something potentially the whole online to offline tracking that could have a positive impact on CPCs? And separately any updates on how you think about Fiber longer term? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Okay, so why don't I take the last portion and then Nikesh may have views on this data conversion plan.","On Fiber look, you've heard our announcement earlier this quarter where we're working with 34 cities and looking for working with these municipalities, they've indicated to us they are really excited about, they kind of self-selected to be really excited about getting Fiber and the next generation of access.","So, right now, we're basically working directly with them to look if we have the right conditions to actually go to the next stage which would be the build. So, very excited about it. I think that it's a really good sign of things to come in access in general.","I think that everybody now in the industry is talking about the gig. It's becoming the standard and we're absolutely thrilled for all of the users out there that can think in one day they will get a gigabit of symmetrical internet at reasonable price. So, stay tuned on the next part of the chapter, but really excited to work with these communities. And Nikesh maybe you want to talk about--?","Nikesh Arora","Yeah. Thank you, Gene. I mean as I mentioned earlier and the question earlier from -- I think it was Heather that the online to offline conversions are really important opportunity where it's important for offline merchants to be able to understand what results they get from their online activity.","And some of the experiments that we talked about required partnerships of third-party data providers to understand how that happens and I think Datalogic is one of those things, which we're looking out to see how we can help quantify the opportunity and quantify the answer for our offline partners. It's just one of those things that we're doing.","Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray","Great. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Gene. Just in closing before I hand it over to Jamie, just to reiterate the point that Nikesh made a bit earlier to all of our Googlers out there and all of our partners out there, thank you so much for the great work in Q1. What a great start to the year and then we'll see you in Q2. So thanks. Jamie I'll leave it with you to close the call please.","Operator","Thank you. Again, that does conclude today's conference. We do thank everyone for your participation. Please have a great day."],"1169":["Google, Inc.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Willa Lo, Investor Relations Manager. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Willa Lo","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today\u2019s second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. With us are Pat Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer; Susan Wojcicki, Senior Vice President, Advertising.","Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So, please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.","Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google\u2019s future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.","We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.","With that, I will now turn the call to Larry.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Willa, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. So, well, this is a special call as we enter into a new chapter in our history at Google here with our recent acquisition of Motorola, and with it comes a new set of financial information for all you both at a consolidated, but also at the segment level.","So speaking of Motorola, it\u2019s worth noting that given the recent close of the transaction, we can expect this specific segment of our financials to continue to show some accounting variability. So for example, this quarter it\u2019s a stub period, so meaning it only reflects the results since the acquisition dates rather than the full quarter. And as a result of the close, we did a number of accounting adjustments typical for such transactions. So we\u2019ll try to do our best to answer your questions on this call. And our investor relations team will also continue to support the analyst and the investor community during this transition.","So now, let\u2019s quickly cover our consolidated result as well as segmented reporting for both Google and Motorola.","Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 35% year-over-year to $12.2 billion and 15% quarter-over-quarter. So again, please remember that these total consolidated numbers include the stub period for Motorola. Additionally, there was a significant year-over-year currency headwind in Q2. In fixed FX, revenue would have grown to 39% year-over-year instead of 35%.","Google on a standalone gross revenue grew 21% year-over-year to $11 billion and 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google website revenue was up 21% year-over-year to $7.5 billion and 3% quarter-over-quarter, which trends across most major geographies and verticals.","Google network revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $3 billion, and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our other revenue line grew by 42% year-over-year to $439 million and 5% quarter-over-quarter. It\u2019s again worth noting that in fixed FX our revenue would have grown 25% year-over-year.","Motorola grew revenue for the stub period since May 22 at $1.3 billion. Our mobile devices revenue for that period was $843 million, encouraged by the strength of the North American Verizon franchise driven by the RAZR MAXX sales. Although we\u2019ve seen also weaker revenues that were driven by the declining international sales of feature phones and mid-tier smartphones; the home business, revenue was $407 million.","So the core metrics of Google standalone business continue to perform very well against the backdrop of a somewhat difficult global economic environment. Our global aggregate paid-click growth was very strong, up 42% year-over-year, and also up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click growth was down 16% year-over-year, and up 1% quarter-over-quarter. And please remember that the currency headwinds also obviously had a quite negative impact on the CPCs in Q2.","Turning to geographic performance of Google standalone business, U.S., UK and rest of world are growing at a good pace as reflected in our results. In our earnings slides, which you\u2019ll find in our Investor Relation website, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve broken down our revenue by U.S., UK and rest of world, to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for those exact calculation.","Revenue from the U.S. was up 20% year-over-year to $5 billion. Our non-U.S. revenue accounted for 54% of our total revenue or $6 billion, and was up 22% year-over-year, which includes $81 million benefit from our hedging program. The UK was up 20% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, and then fixed FX term; in fact the UK grew 22%.","Coming back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business; other cost of revenue was $2.3 billion in Q2. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $3.3 billion, which excludes stock-based compensation and charges related to the severance and benefit arrangements in connection with the Motorola acquisition of $652 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q2, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 32.3%.","For standalone Google, our traffic acquisition costs were $2.6 billion or 24.7% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.3 billion, and that's excluding SBC of $82 million. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.1 billion, also excluding SBC of $470 million.","Finally, non-GAAP operating profit was $4 billion in Q2, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 36.4%. This continued strong margin in our standalone Google business segment gives us the confidence to continue to fully fund our many strategic growth areas, such as mobile, Android, YouTube and Chrome. Obviously, Susan and Nikesh will go into more details of our initiatives in a minute.","At Motorola, our non-GAAP operating expenses including cost of revenue for the stub period were $1.3 billion. And keep in mind that, intangible amortization of expenses and the step-up cost attributed to standalone Google and Motorola are included in these non-GAAP measures. And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss at Motorola was minus $38 million in Q2 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of minus 3% for that specific segment.","Headcount increased roughly 21,500 in Q2, obviously Google itself added about 1200, while the remainder of this number includes the Motorola employees who joined in the acquisition. In total, the consolidated company ended the quarter at around 54,600 employees, full-time employees status.","Our effective tax rate was 19% in Q2, and that reflects not only the mix of our earnings between domestic, international subsidiaries and our hedges, but also capital gains offset by carried over capital losses.","Let me quickly turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $254 million for the quarter, which reflects gains related to a divestiture of a business, offset somewhat by lower interest income and by the impact of our FAS 133 expenses from our hedging program. For more details [underway any], please again refer to the slides of the company or call on our IR website. Operating cash flow was very strong at $4.3 billion for the second quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $774 million versus last quarter at $607 million. The majority of our CapEx was spent really related to production equipment, facilities, and man purchases. And obviously, we're pleased with our free cash flow, which was $3.5 billion.","So now, let me hand it over to Nikesh, who will cover more the details of our business performance in the quarter, then Susan will cover our product highlights. And then finally, we\u2019ll open up the lines for your questions. And please note that Nikesh and Susan will discuss only the standalone Google business and not cover Motorola.","So let me turn it over to Nikesh.","Nikesh Arora","Thank you, Patrick, and hello everyone. Our business had a very strong quarter as you\u2019ve heard with over $11 billion in revenue. I\u2019m going to talk about three broad themes today. First, how our recent big bets in the ad business are coming together into integrated platforms. I think digital advertising is really in defrag mode.","secondly, we\u2019ll take a look under the hood that how our investments and search advertising adds quality by helping our search business accelerate. And third, we\u2019re going to talk a bit about our enterprise business, which I believe is reaching a real turning point, then I\u2019ll discuss some ways for driving success for our customers and some marketing highlights.","So first, our big bets. In about four years, DoubleClick has gone from strength to strength at Google. Now it is the foundation of our display business. this quarter, we announced DoubleClick digital marketing, the first modern ad platform for the modern digital world. This was the biggest ever overall for DoubleClick ad platform. It is used by thousands of agencies and marketers and we managed billions in marketing spend across the world on this platform. It now spans the best of display, rich media, exchange buying, surge and measurement.","Some of our recent display acquisitions, Teracent and Invite Media, which both grew by over 50% last year, are also seamlessly integrated into this platform. At the same time, AdMeld, which we acquired, is helping provide publishers control, flexibility and more revenue opportunities. Our display platform helps direct response in brand marketers navigate the whole web.","For brands, this quarter we unveiled the Brand Activate initiative. As seas of measurement and planning solutions baked directly into our platform, with our partners are building an online measurement for GRPs or gross rating points in a way to measure viewable impressions. Effectively what we want to do is we want to drive more and more advertising dollars in the brand space and this platform is going to be an effective way for us and we\u2019ll do that.","Recently InComm at a big advertising festival, creative agencies loved project [Rebif] this was one of our demos with the possibilities of how in modern digital marketing you can use multiple media formats to make advertising successful. That is quite a change from 2004 when our four line text ads weren\u2019t quite as exciting.","Another big bet as part of our integrated solutions is YouTube. I think in 2007 it was when newspapers frequently said YouTube is groping for an effective business model. I think we can declare we found our model. YouTube now unites the world through video from the Human Rights channel launched this quarter to a (inaudible) study confirming YouTube as a major global news platform. And for the first time, YouTube will be powering NBC\u2019s live streaming of the Olympics in the U.S. while also live streaming the games in London to 64 territories around the world.","Yearly account signups have doubled year-over-year and users are uploading over 72 hours of video every minute. This quarter we released a new YouTube app for Android helping users to find videos and follow channels from a mobile or tablet devices. We believe YouTube is now a proven winner for the whole video ecosystem. Thousands of partners are making six figures and we\u2019re proud to work with major record labels in Hollywood studios on this platform.","In fact, earlier in May, we saw an incredible digital upfront of it, Ban Car, highlighting our YouTube programming partners. Slightly over 13,000 clients attended, some of the worlds biggest advertisers were there and they\u2019re making significant commitments on YouTube including people like Unilever, AT&T and American Express. If you\u2019re counting that\u2019s five successful acquisitions well integrated and helping us succeed in the advertising space.","The sixth is Admob, which helps power our mobile ads, both across Android and IOS and other mobile platforms future. Admob was integrated this quarter into AdWords, this has further turbo charged our ability to provide in-house advertising. That\u2019s more than a million advertisers with 300,000 mobile apps, 350 million devices at their finger tips.","The growth in the businesses with mobile website is stunning. Last quarter we rolled out GoMo which is the short for go mobile, that initiative was rolled out in 8 new countries including Germany, Japan and Brazil. Mobile friendly website are vital modern businesses and very important for our mobile search business. In less than one year the number of advertisers with mobile sites has doubled.","Other major upgrade to Google Analytics was made for mobile apps and the new AdMob SDK for developers turned out to an awesome quarter. For us mobile is like desktop was in 1999, smart marketers are getting great ROI and are developing native ad models that generate results for them. For example, we\u2019ve had 15 million monthly calls for our click-to-call go format exclusively available in mobile devices in the US.","Let\u2019s talk about my second theme, the secret souls of search advertising. This quarter showed why we\u2019re so optimistic about search\u2019s continued growth. You know about some factors that drive search, the overall move to digital media and new search ad formats.","Privacy, we often underestimate one factor that you don\u2019t often read about. The amount of effort our product engineering teams put into the quality and precision for ads, that just keeps getting better. This quarter made 72 quality improvements and launched greater auctions transparency for search advertisers, effectively what results it improves the relevance of our add and making it more useful to consumers, it drives better results for our partners, clients and advertisers and it helps improve monetization.","Imagine if every single search ad was a perfect answer that drove the conversion for the customer, I think that\u2019s the objective that our teams are aiming for.","In Q2, our improvements included better triggering of site links and ads and improved ad rotation system, better geographical targeting, expanded match for keyword variance and a whole host of other improvements. As an example of benefits of these changes, the advertisers taking advantages of new close variance feature and exact and phrase matching are seeing roughly a 2% increase in clicks in average.","Let\u2019s talk about the third theme, the technology, where we are in our enterprise business. I think it\u2019s become clear for us that we have a serious small, but growing business, which is going to be a future growth engine for Google. I hope you read this week about a company, who said competition was 50% more expensive than Google, and not as cool. That company is now $200,000 a year Google apps customer.","Companies, schools, governments worldwide are moving to the could faster than ever. More than 5 million businesses have now gone Google worldwide. The traction amongst large organizations even such as the U.S. Department of Interior, Fairfax Media in Australia, et cetera. I think it\u2019s clear, you can\u2019t fake a commitment to cloud computing, and we\u2019ve invested to build and scale a business that has gone to upstart to upper crust.","Thousands of businesses switch to Google apps from our competitors everyday. Recently, we\u2019ve launch products like Google Drive, Google Maps Coordinate, as well as the ability to edit documents off-line and in a whole range of mobile devices and tablets. That just shows you the pace of innovation that Google is bringing to the business technology.","With over 1 million active applicants of App Engine and the recent launch of Compute Engine, our Cloud Platform that makes Google\u2019s infrastructure directly available to developers and businesses.","Let\u2019s change the gears. Let\u2019s talk about countries and how our performance was across the world. Across all products, growth in the Americas and Asia was steady relative to the first quarter. The U.S. and Canada remains strong. Southern Europe slowed slightly as it was hampered by a poor macro economic in overall ad industry conditions notably Spain. On the other hand, performance accelerated in non-Europe driven by the UK.","Our clients span a full range of industries that are making the web work for their business. Let's take a few examples. Take the hotel and travel sector; in France, we work with (inaudible) to revamp and improve the search investment allocation across 23 countries. In Denmark, top travel site, (inaudible) shifted some of their TV budgets to YouTube and other Google branding solutions.","We\u2019re particularly proud about our achievements in the automotive sector from Detroit to Bavaria. This quarter's highlights included a contract with Tesla, and a (inaudible) deal with Audi to embed Google Earth in all of their cars. In Canada, we partnered with Ford around online video content and GM and Toyota is investing significantly in YouTube.","Switching gears to our agency partners, they are leading the charge in the digital era. I think we have the best relationships with agencies around the world than we\u2019ve ever had before. And we are being able to more those relationships to real partnerships that allows them to work with their customers to make the web work for them.","I\u2019m particularly proud of the work this quarter with our agency partner Starcom MediaVest Group to develop a global joint account planning project across 50 top accounts. We lunched a digital training curriculum, covering Google products and digital trends, and we\u2019re able to train over 8,000 people.","(Inaudible) sectors are good examples, but our partnerships permit all the industries and across all countries. Spanish Health Insurance, Sanitas, made a major investment in search, and now that's become our most efficient channel from customer acquisition online accounting for about 25% to 30% of their new customers.","In France, Denon is working with us on a global initiative across our display and YouTube products, as well as U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturer Shire, Intel in China chose AdMeld for a cross-platform campaign on Android and iOS because of the reach that AdMeld provides them and the seamless solutions we offer.","And in Sweden, H&M is using Google+ social extensions for search addressing. Not only does it increase traffic, but it also gives them a large number of engaged followers. They\u2019ve increased their (inaudible) in AdWords because of that by an average of 22%.","Let\u2019s talk briefly about marketing. Marketing is a key focus for our consumer products, and speaking about Google+, our marketing team continues to do a phenomenal job supporting our investments there. That's a Plus campaign is now in the U.S., U.K., Japan, France, and Germany and is helping to connect communities in Google+. Since this quarter, we organized hangouts with diverse groups, so it advances into the NBA to the UEFA.","As I mentioned the Cannes Lions festival, I\u2019m particularly proud not only are we providing great marketing solutions to our partners and our customers, our own marketing team received two Grand Prix awards, one for Project Re: Brief where we worked with Coca-Cola to take an old ad and make it relevant in the digital media space, and two for our U.K. voice search campaign. But not only that they brought back 25 additional awards, five golds, eight silvers, 12 bronze, our own min-Olympics. That\u2019s our marketing team showing that innovation for everything we do.","I\u2019ll leave you with two final examples that show the diversity of Google\u2019s partnerships. In France, this quarter, we move forward with the commercial relationship with SNE, which effectively represents French publishers, to put out of print books into Google Play for Android. This helps user more easily access this material and enables publishers to generate additional revenue for their continent.","And second, from the sublime French literary tradition to even more sublime Doodle 4 Google contest. Our U.S. winner was Wisconsin second grader Dylan Hoffman, who in May compete a record 114,000 school children from 48 states. His school earned a $50,000 technology grand and Dylan\u2019s Doodle grace to Google home page for a day.","I think Dylan is not listening to this call, but if he is, he\u2019s had a pretty successful second quarter as well. So congratulations and thanks to Dylan, his family and his school from Googlers all around the world, and thanks to all the Googlers that allowed us to have such a wonderful quarter.","I\u2019m going to handover to Susan now.","Susan Wojcicki","","Thanks, Nikesh. We also had a busy and productive second quarter for all of our consumer products. Let me start with Search.","Our goal is to deliver technology that just works. Larry has described the perfect search engine as something that understands exactly what you mean and gives you back exactly what you want. We\u2019ve made a start for a more intelligent search, thanks to the Knowledge Graph which understands real world thing, their defining characteristics and their connections to one another.","Our Knowledge Graph currently includes more than 500 million thing, people and places, more than 3.5 billion facts about them. This includes entities like landmarks, celebrities, sport team, works of art and a lot more. For a summarizing related content all at one place people not only find what they\u2019re looking for, but they also make (inaudible).","For example, I was checking [films] this weekend, so I searched for the movie The Dark Knight Rises, from the Knowledge Graph results that\u2019s showed up on the right hand side of my search results, I was able to find out that the movie is coming on tomorrow, some information about the film and which actors star in it. Since, I didn\u2019t recognize all the actors, I clicked on the photos displayed and I was able to see biographical information as well as other movies they\u2019ve been in.","The Knowledge Graph results also should need related movies that other people have searched for. I discovered a number of movies, including movies scheduled to come out later this year and next year that I also want to see.","The Knowledge Graph also works great on mobile. If you voice search for Julia Roberts movies on your phone, you will see a list of her latest films in the search results. And if you are running an Android device with Jelly Bean, our latest Android release, Google will actually say the list of movies back to you, powered by the Knowledge Graph in addition to giving you the traditional search results.","Also on Android, we introduced Google Now, a feature that intelligently brings you the right information at the right time, just for you even outward. For example, one morning last week, Google Now told me that (inaudible) 16 minutes longer than normal based on current traffic. All my schedules have been late or now gone. I didn\u2019t have to do anything, the information just showed up as a notification. Google Now also shows me other things I may care about like weather, driving directions, my next appointment, cool places nearby, slide updates and scores for my sports.","As you can see, we\u2019re serious about providing more intelligent results. We\u2019re moving beyond the search engine that just matches strings of words to one that understands the people, the world where people do. Just as a knowledge graph connects real-world thing; Google+ is a social spine that is starting to connect everything across Google. With a new Google+ local feature accessible from desktop and mobile on Maps, Search and Google+, the users can find and share nearly 100 million places and local businesses like restaurants and museums.","You just can make decisions about where they want to go based on Zagat scores, summaries and reviews from friends and people they trust who are on Google+. Once they decided where to go, they can use the New Events tab in Google+ to plan their activity and to share photos and comments before, during, and after the event.","We\u2019ve also redesigned the Google+ app for both Android and iOS, and we\u2019re recently announced a Google+ experience for Google, for Android tablets and the iPad. More users are now accessing Google+ from mobile devices than from desktops. Today, 250 million users have upgraded to Google+ meaning, they\u2019ve signed up for Google+ and created a profile. we\u2019re excited about this momentum, but we know, it\u2019s still early days that people build a community on Google+.","Moving on to shopping; this is another area where we\u2019re helping people more quickly turn their intentions into actions. In May, we announced a new commercial model built on product listing app, it\u2019s called Google Shopping and our transition to the new model will be complete in the fall in the U.S. By having a commercial relationship with merchants, we believe consumers will see more reliable and up-to-date information of our prices and product availability. A merchant should receive higher quality traffic to their site.","We\u2019re also experimenting with new commercial formats on Google.com that have product summaries and larger product images. These new formats are clearly labeled sponsors and they help shoppers more easily find and compare different products, or refine their searches by brand or product type. Try searching for camping tents to see an example of these new results.","Users can find special offers and deals with Google Shopping, and can shop with confidence when they see a Google trusted store badge on retailer site.","On the platform side, we had a lot of key announcements and launches at our Google I\/O developer conference. Let me give a quick summary of the highlights. We announced 1 million new Android devices are being activated each day with more than 400 million devices now activated worldwide.","We showed our Jelly Bean, our latest version of Android and the Nexus 7, a tablet that is build for Google Play. More than 20 billion apps have been downloaded from Google Play. We announced that Chrome has 310 million users worldwide, which is up from a 160 million last May.","We brought Chrome for Android out of beta and we introduced Chrome for iOS which became the most popular free app in the Apple app store within hours of its availability.","We launched our new infrastructure service product called Google Compute engine, which lets developers and businesses run Linux virtual machines on the same infrastructure that powers Google.","Google documents became editable offline and we announced Google Drive for iOS. Drive is a place to create, share and store all your content that\u2019s available even without an internet connection, and it functions across Windows, Mac, Android, Chrome OS and now iOS.","We released 3D cityscapes in Google Earth for mobile, announced that travelers with an Android device can now access offline map of more than 150 countries. And expanded our Street View maps, our Street View feature in Google Maps to provide panoramic imagery in more than 3,000 cities, across 40 countries.","And then of course there was Sergey surprise demo of Google Glass, with a live video hangout with skydivers wearing Google Glass and jumping out of an airship nearly a mile above downtown San Francisco, and then landing on the roof of the I\/O Conference Center. To see this demo for yourself, you can search on Project Glass demo on YouTube. I definitely recommend this video.","Thanks all for your time and now back to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Susan. I\u2019m never going to jump off with one of these balloon plane. So it was an absolutely unbelievable experience and thanks for Sergey\u2019s innovation on that one. One more thing just before we turn to Q&A, just a couple of announcements, one, we have just launched our Google+ Investor Relations page, which is designed really to be a great source for Google products updates and company news relevant to investors and shareholders. So please be sure to check it out and let the IR team know what you think of it. So that\u2019s just launched about an hour ago.","And as we are about to open the lines, I just also want to invite David Drummond, our Chief Legal Officer, he will be joining Nikesh, Susan, and myself to answer any questions that you may have. So welcome David to the call as well. And we are going to turn on now Jamie to the Q&A section. So let us know how we want to operate.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.","Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 Citigroup","Great. Thanks. Two questions please. First on Motorola, the comments at the time of the acquisition is that it would accretive, do you still feel that that asset can be in any thoughts would give us as to how you would make, what has been pretty consistently a loss leading asset that Motorola Mobile, how you make that accretive? And then a product on Search and what you find in terms of the appetite with the interest in voice search, Google has had a voice search capability for a while. But as you\u2019ve noticed over time, people are more interested in using that less the quality of that versus whatever regular search. How interesting do you think that is as a growth area for Google in the future voice search? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","So I\u2019ll just answer the Motorola question, and then let Susan jump in on the Search. On the question of Motorola, look we\u2019re totally excited about this opportunity that we have with Motorola, and our management team has been there only a few weeks. Clearly, everybody should expect some changes at Motorola that we have already talked about in the public domain and when we said, Dennis and the management team is there resetting and retooling it. but we have nothing really to announce right now. I think we have to let them do their work. but I can tell you that was a probable excitement in MMI for all the employees, but also for the clients.","So I just want to come back, Mark to your point on accounting. If you actually took out the accounting issues that were related to closing the transaction where it\u2019d be just upgrade, the amortization of intangibles, and some of the adjustments that were related to the acquisition, in fact on the mobile side, they didn\u2019t have \u2013 they had a pretty stable and good quarter, and there\u2019s a lot of accounting noise in the data. So I think it\u2019s going to take one or two quarters before all that noise comes out. Susan, do you want to comment on the voice search?","Susan Wojcicki","Sure. Yeah, so I mean voice search has been an area that Google has been investing in for a number of years. we believe like we have really good technology here, because we\u2019ve invested for so long on this. and as I mentioned in my \u2013 when I talked before hand, now with the Jelly Bean release, we have the ability not only to ask a question, but also to have the answers given back to you. And so, I definitely recommend that you test it out. it is very powerful and we think in the right circumstances, users will want to \u2013 some users will want to type and some users will want to have voice. And so in the circumstances where they do, was developed a really amazing technology that is leading edge on that.","Mark S. Mahaney \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you, Susan. Thank you, Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","","Thanks for you questions, let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","We will take our next question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.","Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","","Thanks, I guess one question and two parts for Patrick on Motorola. You talked a little bit about some of the accounting noise, Patrick, and it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s finalized. Yeah, but, I was wondering if you could give us a rough sense of the purchase price allocation in terms of the hard assets, versus goodwill versus other intangibles so we can sort through some of that noise.","And the second part is, I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the Motorola home business in terms of how that fits in, if you guys consider that strategic? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","","Okay, so on the details of the purchase price we haven\u2019t given in terms of the asset and obviously the IR team can follow up with you on that, but I think in our disclosures the press release like, you will see like for example, intangibles was 30 some million in the case of Motorola and 32 I believe for Google. Just on the intangibles, so it gives you a sense of numbers for the step periods. As it relates to the home business, I mean, again a bit of the same story that I told Mark prior, which is, we\u2019ve just got into the place and we\u2019re in the process of evaluating every business of MMI, in every division of it. So it\u2019s a little bit too early for us comment on big changes right now. So I just need a bit of patient for us to complete our home work as we\u2019ve been there just for a few weeks.","Spencer Wang \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Sure, thanks a lot Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","","Thanks Spencer. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.\t","Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions, one on mobile and one on YouTube. On mobile, have you conducted any studies on the impact of mobile adoption or search query demand by end users. And do you have a perspective on what portion of mobile queries are incremental versus cannibalistic for handsets and tablets.","And on YouTube, I think one or two quarters ago, Nikesh referred to Google Analytics as the unsung hero of the business. Thinking about YouTube brand advertisers, how do you give them visibility into brand advertising ROI in YouTube, and do you think you will be able to do that to get the dollars to flow and overcome the obvious challenges that you may have there?","Patrick Pichette","","So, Nikesh would answer the second question; Susan on cannibalization of mobile versus desktop.","Susan Wojcicki","Yeah, definitely; maybe we\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at that to trying to understand how those two different types of devices and how those searches are interactive with each other. And this is very complicated, but I will say we believe that mobile searches are mostly incremental. For example on weekend, when you \u2013 those are out and about, you usually see a raise in mobile activity. And then when users are back on Monday, we see a raise of desktop. So, although it\u2019s not a one-for-one, we do believe that they are mostly incremental.","Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC\t","","And does it value Susan between handsets and tablets.","Susan Wojcicki","In terms of queries?","Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC\t","No, on the incremental versus cannibalistic.","Susan Wojcicki","I mean we\u2019d look \u2013 I think we\u2019re still in the process of trying to have run our analysis and trying to figure that out. I mean I think that the thing that handsets and tablets have in common is they\u2019re both on the go and people are willing to take their mobile, people use tablet certainly in the office environment as well. So, I would say, we\u2019re still doing the analysis on that.","Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Yeah, so we have a clear view on the handsets and on the tablet there\u2019s more analysis to be done; on YouTube, Nikesh?","Nikesh Arora","(Inaudible) Carlos, hi, so in YouTube there are two different issues. And if you\u2019re talking about performance advertisers, they\u2019re able to look at ROI on YouTube versus other performance media on the online space. I guess more interesting when you start talking about brand, because brand is not just about the online space, brand is also about the television space. And we\u2019ve done very exciting things, with single source panels, where we worked in Germany with thousands of users and try to look at advertising effectiveness and efficiency, not just on YouTube and online video, but also compared to television and we\u2019re incorporating data into our analytics and our sales pictures to show how the ROI is available on YouTube. We\u2019ve noticed only doing at higher ROI, but we also get higher reach and higher frequency capabilities on YouTube, because you are looking at users on a very large online platform.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks for your question Carlos.","Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Let\u2019s jump to the next one please, Jamie?","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Ben Schachter \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","And just two questions, I was wondering first, give an update us on Larry\u2019s health situation and then I know it\u2019s early, but can you update us on the usage of Chrome for iOS devices, and any comments you can give to help us understand the importance of that product and also how you plan to market it. And then also, historically you\u2019ve talked about self driving cars and some of these other projects as relatively low investment, high media profile projects, but it seems with Google Glass and some others and they are taking more management time and focus, should we be thinking about those differently? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Yes, I want to let Nikesh talk about Larry situation, Susan can talk about the second question on iOS Chrome and then I\u2019ll just take it to run, so Nikesh.","Nikesh Arora","There is no more new news on Larry. Larry has lost is voice and we said that means he cannot do any public speaking engagements for the time including today\u2019s earnings call, but he continues to run the company and he is here and involves in all the strategic business decisions that we\u2019re making.","Patrick Pichette","Susan.","Susan Wojcicki","And on Chrome for the iOS device from the moment we launched it was a very popular in the app store and we\u2019ve seen this one of the top apps and it\u2019s something we\u2019ve invested for many years on Chrome. It\u2019s got a lot of really compelling features, from security, being very fast and we continue to expect to see growth just because of the users using it for the different features that make it a really great product.","From the other things, the self driving cars and Google+, I mean those continue to be projects that from a headcount perspective are very \u2013 are small, we\u2019ve talked about them being they are small, but they have the potential to be very big. And I think they are also projects that \u2013 we sort of think about them as moon shops a lot of time, like projects that we think can have really amazing capabilities, but again, and they get the company excited, but in terms of actual resources, it is a very small number.","Patrick Pichette","Yeah, the fact that Sergey is actually leading the Glass project doesn\u2019t change any of the strategy. So from that perspective just very exciting and fun to share it with people when we have such exciting demos. But I wouldn\u2019t change any of the strategy in terms of the real focus of management and our capital intensity.","Nikesh Arora","Thanks, Ben. Let\u2019s go to our next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.","Scott Devitt \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks for taking my questions. I had two please. You\u2019ve previously referenced the Talent or in last year increased the cash compensation by 10%. I was just wondering given the transition of a number of companies that you compete with for Talent into the public markets, could you just give an updated view on the cost and availability of the Talent in the Valley? And then secondly on a last 12 months basis, Google has generated $12.5 billion in unlevered free cash, so you now have an 8% unlevered free cash yield and you are generating cash at an run rate that equates to about 30% of the current cash positions. So I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about the way that you are currently thinking about capital allocation or specifically a share repurchase? Thanks.","Nikesh Arora","Okay. So let me start with the second one first. We continue, and I know that sound a bit like a broken record on this, but on a very regular basis, we actually debated with our board. In our \u2013 our cash position is really a strategic asset to us given all of the innovation that's happening, and all of the options that are available to us.","I mean it has been such, and you just take Motorola, which we just closed, I mean it was a real strategic asset to us to actually be able to pounce. So we haven't changed our position in terms of share repurchases or dividends or any of the others for a time being, which does not mean we don't evaluate. We do take a good look at it. We just think that it continuous to be a strategic asset for us, and so that's why we haven't changed our position yet.","In the case of the talent, I think that the Valley continues to be hot, I mean it's a hotbed of innovation. There's a lot of need for that talent, especially the very high, the engineering front, and we're delighted by our strategy. I mean we continue to see really benchmark levels for our retention purposes, and we continue to attract the very best talent. So for us, it is an absolute strategic asset again for the company. I mean, Googlers, the engineers that are here in the salespeople and they've really make a huge difference to the velocity of the company. So the Valley has not change, it content despite everything else is going on in the world out there are. The Valley continues to be absolutely hot, and we\u2019re still pleased to have seen our strategy pay out so well. So thanks for your question Scott. Very good question.","Let's go to our next question please Jamie.","Operator","And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, great, thank you. I had two questions. First, what are you seeing in terms of mobile CPC trend, and how do you see these trends playing out over the course of the next 12 months. And then, the second question is, with the Nexus 7 on the market, can you talk a little bit about your plan to accelerate content acquisition in particular in video and book? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","I think Nikesh is perfectly suited for both.","Nikesh Arora","Hi, Heather. Thank you for your question. Well, I think the good news is that we\u2019re seeing phenomenal growth in the mobile queries across the board, whether it\u2019s tablets, whether it\u2019s mobile phones, whether it\u2019s geographical or whether we are seeing phenomenal amounts of mobile queries across the board. I think as I said, mobile is right now where Search was in 1999. we had a situation where Susan\u2019s team was doing phenomenal product innovation to keep driving more and more efficiency for the advertisers. we were working with advertisers to get them to get better landing pages, better sites, get them to understand truly the opportunities on the mobile space for example. You can make phone calls, so we have a product called Click-to-Call. Now the Search takes on a whole different meaning, because there\u2019s a better conversion and people actually click and make phone calls.","So we are seeing mobile CPCs are healthy and we expect them the long-term that they will continue to be healthy and sort of follow this trajectory that Search has followed, more inventory, more effectiveness, more ROI for the advertisers, better pricing in the market. In terms of your second question on Nexus 7, I think we have made tremendous amounts of headway in the content space that we have a lot, lot of content on Google Play. we are working very closely with the music industry, with Hollywood studios et cetera, to get more and more content on the platforms, so I think given that there are models out there where other people are offering content to the platforms. it is becoming to the standards that you can have the ability to offer content to the end user and we are making tremendous amounts of progress across the board.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks for your question, Heather. Let\u2019s go to our next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Doug Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan","Great, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask two things, just first following up on the mobile CPC question, can you just give us some color on what percentage of advertisers are bidding on smartphone to N tablets in addition to the desktop? and then secondly, Patrick can you also just help us understand the accounting around the Nexus 7 tablet and how we should be thinking about that on a growth versus net basis and the impact it may have going forward? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Okay. So I will let Nikesh cover the CBC and I also come back after.","Nikesh Arora","Yeah, actually I think I already said that in my prepared remarks that we have over 1 million advertisers working with us in mobile advertising and it gets over 300,000 mobile apps. So I think it\u2019s a substantive number in terms of number of advertisers are involved in mobile space. And I think usually people will get enrolled in mobile space don\u2019t distinguish between smartphones and tablets, they actually, they want to find the most effective ROI they can get and they want to capture as many queries as you get on these device. Patrick?","Patrick Pichette","No, the issue for the Nexus S, Nexus 7, the \u2013 I mean we have two sets of accounting, obviously, it\u2019s distributed on it\u2019s own by others like, you can get it at Best Buy and otherwise when you use the Play Store to actually buy it right, we book the revenue and then we book the cost as well and the cost will be in other cost of revenue rather than CAC or TAC, they\u2019re neither of them and that\u2019s how the accounting is set.","Susan Wojcicki","Yeah, and this is Susan, just one more thing I would add Doug on your question about the mobile CBCs and the percentage that are bidding, is a lot of campaign structures are setup so that when an advertiser participates in a bid, they actually bid, they can instead of one campaign and it can run across everything. And we adjust those prices dynamically for them, we have \u2013 it\u2019s called Smart Pricing. And so some advertisers do bid specifically on mobile and then some advertisers have bundled campaigns and we adjust those prices. So it\u2019s not just advertiser that are bidding only for mobile that are participating in mobile.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks for your question, Doug. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Great. When you look at your international result ex-FX, they actually were stable or even accelerated. Yeah, we are hearing a lot of issues over there. Can you talk about geographic mix, what countries are doing well or vertical mix and any product enhancements or new products you\u2019ve launched that are really helping your revenue growth there. And then secondly, TAC to distribution partners was up about $40 million quarter-over-quarter and continues to be a bigger chunk of your Google website revenues. What drove the quarter-over-quarter increase, was that mostly mobile or are there other factors? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","So, let me jump on TAC, and then let Nikesh answer to the first question. So TAC, it's really a mix, right, obviously TAC reflects a mix of the different distribution methods that include toolbars, chrome distribution, mobile distribution, and also obviously the AFS business as well. So there's a \u2013 if you look at our revenue mix between Google properties and network, right network will attach stronger, so that will drive TAC as well. And then, mobile is also one of these contributing factors. So we don't break down all these specifics, but it\u2019s not only mobile. I mean, we have a number of factors that are at play here. On the first question, I\u2019ll let Nikesh circle back to you.","Nikesh Arora","Yeah, I alluded to some of this in the prepared remarks. I think, as I said growth in the Americas and Asia has been steady this quarter. The U.S. and Canada have stayed strong, and as I mentioned, as you\u2019ve said there have been some issues internationally. Southern Europe, we saw slide dip as we think it is hampered both by pure macro economic conditions and all ad industry concerns. Spain was a notable sort of lowlight or highlight depending on how you look at it in that conversation. On the other hand, performance accelerated for us in northern Europe driven by the UK and the UK has been a little depressed over the last few quarters. So it is finally coming back and sort of we are seeing strength there again.","In terms of your question and on the sectors, I think travel has been strong pretty much across the board in the U.S. and the UK and around the world. Auto was strong in the U.S. for us, healthcare has been strong in the UK, and generally across the world, we've seen strong sort of performance both in finance and local, and we're seeing more and more sort of excitement and enthusiasm in sectors like CPG and entertainment given the shift to brand. But I\u2019d say, this is the snapshot in time and these things change quarter-over-quarter.","Justin Post \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Justin. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next caller please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.","Anthony Diclemente \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, thanks. One, I think for Susan, just if you can help us with the order of the magnitude the drivers of the divergence that we continue to see between CPCs and volume. I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about, of course mobile is one of those drivers, but then FX, we have a sense of that, property mix, emerging markets and add quality changes, all driving that. So I was wondering if you guys could give us like a ordered magnitude of how important each of those key drivers were in the quarter and then how we should think about those trending going forward, if we should expect that divergence to normalize or should we actually expect it to continue to diverge? It will be helpful. Thank you very much.","Patrick Pichette","","Susan, do you want to give some comments on it or Nikesh.","Nikesh Arora","I think, I had the CPC (inaudible) on this quarter and you can\u2019t have a good earnings call, if you don\u2019t talk about CPC, so here we go. CPC is an important metric for us, but if you take that independently, it\u2019s not necessarily a reflection of the fundamental health of our business. This quarter, I\u2019d say the biggest impact on CPC was actually FX. We have four or five factors that impact CPC, but the biggest impact this quarter was FX. We have clearly an impact of mobile versus tablet versus desktop, we have an impact of emerging versus developed markets, and what\u2019s happening from a macro economic point of view, that we\u2019ve talked about, we have an impact on google.com versus network, so as you see the network playing a bigger role, it impacts CPC. And finally as quality changes, also impact CPC, but I\u2019d say this quarter the impact has been felt because of FX, but from a positive perspective we see any time there was a change in CPC, which is more attractive for the advertiser that allows the advertiser get a bit of ROI, but for us it\u2019s an opportunity for the advertising.","Patrick Pichette","Yeah, it\u2019s important to know that the 16%, there was a big chunk of it, that was CPC versus the last quarter. I mean, as the euro kind of went down 9% year-over-year, I mean it obviously makes a big difference. So thanks for your question.","Anthony Diclemente \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, and that\u2019s a nice one. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Cheers. Let\u2019s go to the next question please, Jamie.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Sena with Evercore Partners.","Ken Sena \u2013 Evercore Partners","Hi, thank you. Can you just maybe talk a little bit more about the Offers business and do you feel strongly about that business as you did in the past. And maybe how that business actually will come into play with Google+ or on payments or (inaudible)? Thank you.","Susan Wojcicki","","Hi, Ken. So yeah Offers continues to be an area that we are investing in, we have, I mean we think that there is a lot of things that are really important about Offers the way it\u2019s a local business and works with both small and large business it\u2019s got, there is a lot of user interest in it. So it is an area that we are continuing to invest in. We\u2019re also, as we continue to develop our business model continues to evolve. And for example, we are putting a little \u2013 we\u2019re working with a lot of the different Offers and providing distribution for them in addition to generating our own Offers with our own sales team. So, but it continues to be an important area for us, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in the cities that we\u2019re currently operating in.","Ken Sena \u2013 Evercore Partners","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Sure.","Susan Wojcicki","Thank you, Ken.","Susan Wojcicki","","Jamie, our next question please.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Ronald Josey with ThinkEquity.","Ronald Josey \u2013 ThinkEquity LLC","Great, thanks for taking my question. Going back to mobile and the opportunity there, Nikesh I thought that might be interesting if you could talk a little bit about, perhaps what you are seeing in terms of the campaigns and there has been an acceleration, now that AdMob is fully integrated in AdWord, knowing that there is over a million advertisers and 300,000 apps. I\u2019m wondering if there is been accelerations since that's happened? Thank you.","Nikesh Arora","Hi, thanks for the question. I think as I said, we are seeing phenomenal amount of growth in the mobile query space and it\u2019s a consequence of more device, it\u2019s a consequence of more adoption of tablets around the world. It's also comfortable with the devices and using them more often. So with the number of questions they asked on the AdMobs. so AdMobs just got completed in early June. So it\u2019s a bit early to say, we're seeing acceleration. but generally, our performance throughout that integration has been very strong and we\u2019ve effectively had a very, and what we\u2019ve done about six months ago, as we took all of our sales efforts and we took our specialized mobile sales people, we had them trained all of our sales forces around the world. So that impact has even contributed more than just that integration part. but we think the integration is just going to turbocharge that effort and hopefully continue to help us drive mobile. and mobile is going to be here for a while. I think it\u2019s a fact of life for us now. So we are mobile sort of becoming as core, as desktop search was, so we\u2019re making sure that all of our sales people around the world are fully equipped and working with every advertiser, not just 1 million to make sure that people can see ROI in both mobile and desktop simultaneously.","Ronald Josey \u2013 ThinkEquity LLC","Great, thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Ron. Let's go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hey, good afternoon. I have one question just on the shifted mobile and specifically around this will be both Nexus as well as Motorola. How important do you think it is for ultimate mobile modernization to actually control the whole experience on the device and given that you\u2019ve got all sorts of different competitors some who subsidize evidently, some obviously telling full price, hardware, software combos, what do you think the right mixes for Google and when do you think you\u2019ll sort of sort this out and be a little bit more declarative in the market with your intentions? Thanks.","Nikesh Arora","I think, hi this is Nikesh again Jason. thanks again for your question. And as I said, mobile is very, very important. I think it\u2019s better to go back and think about what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. We said we\u2019re very committed to mobile; it\u2019s evident in our commitment to Android in our ecosystem as well as Motorola acquisition.","So we believe that mobile us very and very important critical to the future. Now, I know it seems a little complicated when you look at the different competitors, and how you talked about subsidies et cetera. We simplify that by focusing on, how do we provide the best experience to the user. Now providing the best experience to user, is effectively working really hard with Andy Rubin, Stephen Android making sure he is getting the best experience for the end-user and in that process he works with the best OEMs in the marketplace to make sure that the combination of hardware and software allows for the best experience to be delivered. I think, for us what's important as to get that experience delivered and we will work with whatever the industry models that are out there, either we work direct with operators, trying to make sure that happens behind the end-user and more often they\u2019ll not be work with OEMs, to see how we can get the best agreed experience in the hands of the end-user. I think that's what we're going to focus on. So, I think that's quite declarative in terms of intention.","Patrick Pichette","Yeah. I mean just to close, open is really important to Google and in that context you see our strategy is very focused on end-users and been open and we are going to get a lot of benefit that we already have and continue to get a lot of benefit out of that. So, it's a complex question, there is no doubt about it. Thank you, so much for your question. Let\u2019s go for the next question please.","Operator","Now we\u2019ll take our next question from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.","Lloyd Walmsley \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Thanks, I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the rollout of the shift to paid inclusion for Google shopping and when you expect it to be fully rolled out and kind of what you're seeing today in terms of Paid Clicks and CPCs, now that some of the shopping links have been moved to high end results and where do you think CPCs there can go relative to just core paid search?","Patrick Pichette","","I\u2019ll let Susan answer this one. Susan?","Susan Wojcicki","","Yeah, so Lloyd, so we made this decision to move to a commercial model because we saw that ultimately this would drive a better experience for users and having more up to date information and more accurate price and inventory availability and so we are in the process of rolling that out. We think it will be rolled out. We expect probably completed around the Q4 timeframe. And we are working really hard with all the merchants to get them all on board, and again we think this is actually really good for both the merchants and the users.","We actually don\u2019t refer to this as feed inclusion, just because that actually is a term from the people who have been in the industry for a really long time meaning putting in, paid things into the search results, in a non-marked way. And we\u2019re very, very clear when we show this, we do mark everything very clearly as sponsored, and again we believe that actually moving to this model is good for both the users and for the merchants and we\u2019re really looking forward to this transition.","Lloyd Walmsley \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","","Thanks for your question, a very important piece for us. Let\u2019s go to our next question please.","Operator","We will take our next question from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company.","Kevin Kopelman \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","","Hi, thanks. Could you give us a sense of how big your mobile search queries are, as a percentage of total search queries? And also on Motorola, I know you\u2019re not giving us a business update, but could you give us what the Android unit growth was in the quarter on a pro forma basis? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","","Well, on the last one, on the mobile side, the non-home side, it\u2019s all Android. And on the search queries, we don\u2019t actually provide the details. We provide the geographics, but we don\u2019t give the details of the other one. So, I am sorry Kevin if we can\u2019t be more helpful on the granular details on this issue.","Let\u2019s see, we have time for one more question, let\u2019s jump on one last question, Jamie?","Operator","Thank you, sir. We\u2019ll take our last question from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.","Jason Helfstein \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ll ask you just two. One, can you just talk about the growth of Google+ number growth, are you happy? I think you alluded to how that's going. What can you do to drive faster member growth and is that kind of part of the strategy or you just led it organically evolve. So kind of a push versus, I guess the pull strategy there. And then second, can you give us the breakdown of depreciation between Motorola and MII for the quarter? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","","Well, you\u2019ll have, in the segmented reporting you'll find that information. So, after the call, so this is for your second question, Jason. On the issue of depreciation, I think that the team can circle back which would give you the split, because we do the segmented reporting. On the first question, which is about Google growth and our success there, I\u2019ll let Susan cover that one.","Susan Wojcicki","","Sure. Yeah, so, overall we've been really pleased with the growth that we've seen, you\u2019ve talked about the $250 million accounts that we have, Google+ accounts. And I do think it's also really important to remember that Google+ just celebrated its one-year anniversary. We actually celebrated that at IO. And so, we see that Google+ account growth has growing really well. We think that one of the most important things is that when you have a Google+ account you have the ability to share. And we've talked about Google+ being the social spine across all of our products ability to make all of our products better. Not just the stream, which is an important part, but also for example your search experience. So that if I have a friend, a friend went to hotel, and +1 that hotel, if I\u2019m ongoing to that same location, I would you be able to see that information at the time that I'm doing that search. And so we have many, many use cases where we think being part of Google+ will be a better experience. And so we\u2019re working across the board to make sure that our products are integrated, we have a number of integrations across the products, probably local with the most significant one that we did this quarter, and we find that having those integrations by making the products better, also tried to more usage of Google+. So yeah, so thank you Jason, that was an important question.","Jason Helfstein \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","And with that with an eye on the clock, we\u2019ve got to run. I just wanted to do couple of things; one is thank Nikesh and Susan as well as David for joining us for the call, and Q&A. I also thank all our Googlers, I mean these last 90 days and the great results that we are posting now and beginning of the collaboration and integration of Motorola, all these things are possible because our Googlers do a phenomenal jobs every single day.","So I want to thank everybody and then as I close, remember to go and take a look at our Google+ website for investor relations. And I think you will find it pretty interesting. So with that Jamie, I\u2019ll let you close the call, and I wish everybody a happy summer.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen West","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai.","Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2016, filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumption as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them.","During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz\/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today.","And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Our revenues of $26 billion in the second quarter demonstrate the ongoing momentum in our businesses with broad-based strength globally. Revenues were up 21% year-on-year, and up 23% in constant currency. Advertising revenues benefitted from the strong performance insights, which was led in particular by tremendous results in mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube.","Healthy growth and network revenues was driven by our programmatic business. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from Cloud, Play and hardware. Our outline for today's call is first I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which include the impact of stock-based compensation. The European commission fine of $2.7 billion is reflected in our GAAP results with the fine displayed as a separate line item for clarity.","In order to assist with comparing this quarter's results to prior periods, we are also providing operating income, net income and EPS results that exclude the impact of the fine. The fine is not reflected in our segment results. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter after which we will take questions.","I will start with the summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $26 billion up 21% year-over-year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $364 million or $361 million after the benefits of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 23% year-over-year.","Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography. You can see that our performance was strong in all regions. U.S. revenues were up 23% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. EMEA revenues were $8.5 billion up 14% year-over-year reflecting weakness in the British pound and the euro. Revenues were up 21% in fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $3.7 billion up 28% versus last year and up 27% in fixed FX terms. Other America's revenues which include results from Canada and Latin America were $1.4 billion up 31% versus last year in both reported and fixed FX terms.","On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results were $10.4 billion up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.3 billion up 27% year-over-year primarily driven by Google related expenses. Specifically, costs associated with operating our datacenters including depreciation, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and hardware related costs.","Operating expenses including the impact of the EC fine are $11.5 billion. Excluding the impact of the EC fine operating expenses were $8.8 billion up 18% year-over-year. Year-on-year expense growth reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year.","As discussed previously, this affects the quarterly pace of stock-based compensation in 2017, but not the overall size of the expense for the year. In order to transition to the new timing, we made a one-time half year grant in Q1 of this year, which is reflected in elevated year-on-year expense growth in Q2. As a result, stock-based compensation totaled $2 billion up 33% year-over-year. Headcount at the end of thank you quarter was 75,606 up 1,614 people from last quarter.","Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas the most sizable headcount additions were once again made in Cloud for both technical and sales roles consistent with the priority we place on this business. Operating income was $4.1 billion, excluding the impact of the EC fine, operating income was $6.9 billion up 15% versus last year and the operating margin was 26%.","Other income and expense was $245 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% for the second quarter, net income was $3.5 billion and earnings per diluted share were $5.1. Excluding the impact of the EC fine, net income was $6.3 billion and earnings per diluted share were $8.90.","Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash, CapEx for the quarter was $2.8 billion. Operating cash flow was $7.4 billion with free cash flow of $4.6 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $94.7 billion of which approximately $57.9 billion or 61% is held overseas.","Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $25.8 billion up 21% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $18.4 billion in the quarter up 20% year-over-year. The biggest contributors to growth again this quarter were mobile search and YouTube.","Network revenues were $4.2 billion up 13% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing strength of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $3.1 billion up 42% year-over-year, we have been talking about our bigger investment areas within Google and you can see the momentum here reflecting contributions from our newer revenue streams again this quarter on top of the ongoing strength in Play.","Specifically Cloud continues to benefit from the ongoing investments in our go-to-market and product efforts. Hardware continues to grow at a healthy pace year-on-year with the extension of our product line geographically, particularly Google Home and Wi-Fi, the dollar impacted growth was more muted than in prior quarters reflecting seasonality. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.","Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.1 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 28% year-over-year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenues, as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenues, continues reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year-over-year as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate, driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, which carries lower TAC.","Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 40% year-over-year. Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was $7.8 billion, up 12% versus last year, and the operating margin was 30%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.8 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.","A couple of Google reminders for the third quarter. Headcount additions tend to be seasonally high in Q3, because that is when we bring on new graduates. In addition, please keep in mind that our marketing costs are typically weighted more heavily toward the back-half of the year due to the holiday season, particularly as we promote our made-by Google line of hardware products.","Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the second quarter, Other Bets revenues were $248 million primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $772 million for the second quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $152 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q 2016. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets, a couple of updates.","Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion, such as our recent introduction of the indoor security camera, Nest Cam IQ as well as geographic expansion both of which support its position as the leading brand in the connected home. In life sciences, in addition to our progress at Verily, Calico has focused its efforts on the basic mechanisms of ageing and three ageing related diseases representing the leading causes of death.","Calico has established more than 20 active collaborations with other life sciences companies and academic institutions. With Loon we recently demonstrated the technology in Peru by successful delivering basic internet connectivity to tens and thousands of people affected by the tragic floods there. We worked in partnership with the Peruvian government and Telefonica.","And our progress with Waymo continues nicely, as it is reflected in the writer program in Phoenix and our recently announced partnerships with Lift and Avis.","Let me wrap up, almost two years after the creation of Alphabet, we see the benefits of our focus within Google and Other Bets and are pleased with the opportunities we have for sustained revenue and earnings growth. We are obviously very happy with the ongoing strength in ads revenue, particularly in Search. Our compelling secular trends continue to drive user adoption and engagement with mobile devices. Our engineering and machine learning acumen enables us to build better experiences for users and advertisers.","We continue to see increasing contributions from our growing non-ads revenue businesses, Play continues to be a strong contributor, in addition we have been making big Bets within Google focused on Cloud, hardware and subscription businesses in YouTube in order to better serve customers, while also building additional and differentiated revenue streams.","These businesses are consistent with and complementary to our core capabilities and leverage our infrastructure, distribution and engineering. We believe we have a compelling runway here. Longer-term we see great opportunity in the businesses we are building in Other Bets. These businesses reflect the incredible engineering talent across Alphabet most notably in machine learning.","Our revenue growth and Alphabet structure give us both the opportunity and confidence to invest in our businesses for the long-term. We are doing that, while being very deliberate about the focus, scale and pace of investment and remain committed to being consciences in our use of all resources. We're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential scaling back and others and sharpening our organizational effectiveness to make the most of the resources available.","Thank you. And let me now turn the call over to Sundar.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks Ruth. We had a phenomenal quarter. Google continues to lead the shift to AI driven computing. We are working to make this incredible technology available to everyone around the world. It's our focus on infusing our products and platforms with power of machine learning and AI that's driving our success. Today, I'll spend time talking about the areas where we are confidently investing for the future. First the incredible momentum we are seeing in some of our core products followed by machine learning.","Next an update on three of our most promising bets, YouTube, Cloud and our Hardware businesses. And I will conclude the strong performance of our computing and advertising platforms. To start our core products and the AI powering them. Google has always been about using deep computer science and insights to solve some of the world's most complex problems.","People are no longer only using a keyboard, mouse and multi-touch, but are also using emerging inputs like voice and camera to ask questions and get things done in the real world. We are seeing this in the way people interact with the Google Assistant, which is already now available on more than 100 million devices since launching last year and there is more to come. Since we released an Assistant SDK that will enable a wide range of new hardware devices, which will include the Google Assistant.","We now have more than 70 home automation partners on the Assistant on Google Home and Phones, including Honeywell, Logitech and LG. So you can do everyday things around the house using your voice.","At Google IO, we announced Google Lens available later this year. Lens is a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you're looking at and help you take action based on that information. So for example, if you saw a poster for your favorite band, you would be able to take a picture and get relevant information and buy tickets to their next concert.","In Search, a great feature we launched this quarter in the U.S. is job search. To make looking for a job easier for everyone, no matter what line of work you are in. Many of these products that make people's lives easier are being powered by machine learning.","One focus area for us this quarter has been enabling our machine learning algorithms to learn and improve our products much faster. One such research initiative auto ML enables us to pursue approaches to automate the design of machine learning models. Our ability to rapidly deploy the best machine learning in all of our products enabled us this quarter to launch all sorts of new smart features, to help moderate comments, suggest smart replies in Gmail and improved translations.","We rolled out new machine learning features in Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail and Google Photos, which now has more than 500 million monthly users who backup 1.2 billion photos and videos every day. I was also pleased that deep minds AlphaGo team was in Beijing for the Future of Go Summit where AlphaGo played against the number one world player Ke Jie.","Since playing AlphaGo Ke Jie has been on a 20 game winning streak. He has said playing AlphaGo as fundamentally changed his understanding of the game. It\u2019s remarkable to see AI have such a profound effect on one of the world's oldest most strategic games. It can have the same impact in so many fields from medicine to science to energy usage and more.","Now let's move to some of our biggest Bets. First YouTube. YouTube now has 1.5 billion monthly viewers and people watch on average 60 minutes a day on their phones and tablets. That's incredible and it helps 1000s of passionate video creators make money. The fastest growing stream for YouTube is in the living room. YouTube watch time on TV screens has nearly doubled year-on-year. This quarter we unveiled six new ad supported YouTube originals from celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres and Kevin Hart, and YouTube creators like Rhett & Link.","Advertiser feedback on these new shows has been extremely positive. Last week our Live TV service YouTube TV had a ten new metro areas across America tripling the markets where it\u2019s available in just four months. And to our next big Bet with great momentum Google Cloud.","Google Cloud Platform, GCP continues to experience impressive growth across products, sectors and geographies and increasingly with large enterprise customers in regulated sectors. To be more specific about our momentum with big customers, in Q2 the number of new deals we closed worth more than $0.5 million is three times what it was last year.","Responding to the growth in existing and new customers around the world, we continue to invest in datacenters to provide them the fastest most reliable service. We opened new Google Cloud regions in Northern Virginia, Singapore, Sydney and London.","We also continue to build out our partnerships, in Q2 we announced an expansion of our partnership at SAP and a new partnership with Nutanix to integrate their products with GCP. So customers can run workloads in hybrid environments, On-Prem and in the Cloud using containers and Kubernetes.","Now let's talk about our Hardware business. Sales of our new family of hardware continue to be encouraging and we are making good progress bringing these devices to more people. Google Home is now available in four countries, the U.S., Canada, Australia and the UK and we have announced its coming to France and Germany in early August.","The Pixel phone continues to be really popular and Google Wi-Fi just launched in Canada, Germany and France to glowing reviews. Every day, I hear of people who love this product and how it has made Wi-Fi work much better in their homes. Shifting gears, our computing and advertising platforms are driving great results for our partners.","There are now more than $2 billion monthly active Android devices around the world. It's really humbling so many choose Android. We're seeing a number of hardware makers launching devices to positive reviews, including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6. At Google IO this quarter, we gave developers early access to Android O, which will focus on vitals like battery life and performance.","And Google Play continues to be a vital distribution platform for developers. An incredible 82 billion apps were downloaded from Google Play in the last year alone. That's 11 apps for every person on earth. We continue to work on the next generation of computing platforms, virtual and augmented realty. By the end of this year, there will be 11 Daydream ready devices on the market from manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and Asus.","Turning to our advertising platforms. Here to machine learning is critical to helping advertisers and app developers analyze data in real time to reach consumers with more useful ads and measure campaign effectiveness. At Google Marketing Next this quarter we launched Google Attribution, a comprehensive measurement tool that allows marketers to measure the impact of their campaigns across devices and channels all in one place with no additional cost.","We also launched new ad formats and bidding features in Universal App Campaigns to help developers grow their user base across Google Play, Search, YouTube, Gmail and the Display Network. At Google IO in 2016, we announced we had driven 2 billion app installs, today that number is more than 5 billion that's amazing growth.","With 90% of transactions still happening offline, we want to help consumers find what they are looking for in brick and mortar stores. Our store visits technology is instrumental and understanding customer behavior that starts online and ends in store. Today, our store visits measurement is the largest program of its kind and we have now measured over 5 billion store visits in 17 countries.","This quarter it also brought local ads and store visits measurement to video. Speaking of video, we are seeing continued success with bumper ads, our six seconds ad format. Both brands and viewers love the format as it's the ideal length to capture attention. L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, Xbox, Clinique and Neutrogena have all seen great success with bumpers.","And Google Preferred continues to grow, we now have 100s of brands buying Google Preferred in the U.S. nearly triple the number since it launched three years ago. We are now just helping large brands, we are also helping millions of small businesses get to online and grow. Every month Google helps drive 100 billion visits to business websites and creates more than 3 billion direct connections between businesses and their customers. These interactions drive huge economic opportunities and growth for small businesses.","Last month to increase these opportunities, we launched an easy way for millions of small businesses to create a free simple mobile optimized website. Small businesses can do it on a mobile phone in under 10 minutes, using the listing information already available on Google Search and Maps. And finally helping publishers grow their revenues remains a huge focus for us. We're using the power of automation and machine learning to improve our auction algorithms for publishers.","The 50 improvements we have made since 2016 are generating 15% more revenue for publishers using double click ad exchange. Those are the highlights from the second quarter. This week will be another highlight for me, I'm going to Africa for a Google for Nigeria event to announce new products for Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa.","I'm looking forward to seeing first time how technology and Google's products can make a real difference in people's lives. I want to express a very sincere thank you to every Googler who work tirelessly this quarter to bring all of our technology and products to the world.","And to everyone listening thank you, and I hope you are enjoying starting the week off with us. And now back to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS Securities. Your line is now open.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the question, maybe a big picture question directed to Sundar. As you think about the Google Assistant and what it can do medium-to-long term, maybe talk a little bit about how the Assistant as a product could now roll the gap between consumption and utility inside your products versus monetization over time with this specific focus I would love to hear about local in particular? Thank you so much.","Sundar Pichai","It's a good question, when I think about, we have, we are very focused over the long-term to making sure the Assistant can actually help people get things done in the real world. And so obviously when you think about it from that standpoint local becomes important. Over time, just like when the transition happened from desktop to mobile, people's bar for what they expect increased. They wanted more answers, they wanted more immediate gratification, right and that's a continuum and I think you'll see the trends. And so over time we are laser focused on making sure we can deliver against those experiences, and I think local and their particular strength over time both in terms of, the expertise we have built in local as well as our investment in Maps is hopefully paying off.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan.","Q \u2013 Doug Anmuth","Great, thanks for taking my question. First one for Ruth, I was just hoping you could help us understand at least qualitatively how core margins for the advertising business are trending within the Google segment? And then Sundar just on the Cloud business, I know you talked about four new regions being built out. Can you just talk about your strategy in building out that Cloud infrastructure, how we should think about it in terms of building out extra capacity or whether it's more in line with near-term demand? Thanks.","Ruth Porat","Thanks. So starting with your margin question like as we've often said, we're focused on revenue and operating income dollar growth and not on operating margins. We have strong positions in healthy growing areas and are adding really exciting additional growth areas and that's what we mean when we discussed driving long-term revenue and earnings growth. To get a little more specific, the gross margin, this quarter obviously reflects our product mix shift and although the cost of sales is higher as a percentage of revenues, these costs are associated with high growth product areas that enable us to create value for all of our stakeholders. And then on the OpEx side, the second quarter reflects a number of factors, first I think really to your question on an overtime point, you can see the impact of the timing shift in the equity refresh which we discussed previously. Now as a reminder that does abate in the back-half of the year, but you can see it here in the second quarter.","And then what you are also seeing an OpEx growth is the investments in areas that we've spilled out. So for example in R&D you can see the impact of the headcount increases in our priority areas particularly Cloud and machine learning and marketing spend similarly reflects the strategic priority areas we've delineated particularly hardware and YouTube subscription. But as I said in my opening comments, we're increasing investment in areas where we see the most potential, we are scaling it back in others, we're focused on organizational effectiveness to make the most of all of our resources and all of that really underpins the goal to sustain both revenue and earnings growth over the longer term.","Q \u2013 Doug Anmuth","Thanks that's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","Thank you very much. I was just wondering Sundar, you mentioned some of the strength your seeing in GCP. Now I was just wondering if you could share with us, when you do win is there any commonality around the type of workloads that people are choosing you for? And can you share with us any updates on the go-to-market and kind of how you see all about where you've come over the last year, but even more importantly what you need to do to get it where you needed to be over the next 12 months? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","All right, thanks, I would also take Doug's question on the infrastructure too and do it together, since they are related to Cloud. Overall, when we think about our infrastructure obviously we are serving Cloud as well as our internal products which are seeing tremendous growth as well. In terms of serving Cloud customers, we are world-class and available being reliable and those are things we want to stay best-in-class. So, we are clearly planning for that and planning ahead of our infrastructure and we have been consistently doing that.","And Heather in terms of your question about workloads and stuff, we are actually seeing quite a diverse set of used cases across sectors and industries and geographies and so, I would say the breadth of what we have seen it's really surprised me. In terms of go-to-market, I shared an update on last, on that last quarter not sure there is much more interesting to add, we are continuing to do it well, we are scaling up and all the teams and the structure Diana has put in place is beginning to work well. And we are continuing to hire and scale all of this up, as quickly as we can.","Heather Bellini","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney","Yes, I have two questions please. First, one on TAC, Ruth the factors that cause, have been causing characterizing relatively structural the outsize growth of mobile and the rise of programmatic. So there is no particular reason to think that, we should see anything other than gradual increase in TAC as a percentage of both O&O and network revenue going forward. So are there any reasons why that wouldn't be the case, next year or two? And then Sundar, another one more interesting innovations, that was, that kind of came out of Google IO was Visual Search, and can you just talk about, maybe a little bit roadmap for that or to the extent that which, how long it will take us actually see that broadly in the market, and what you think the appetite or how do you think that will change the way people search for products in the future they build need to also search visually through your phone? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","So on the first question, there are obviously a number of factors that affect Sites TAC we've talked about them over time. The primary driver again this quarter, as you noted in question was the strong growth in mobile and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC. But the increase in Sites TAC year-over-year, I think what I would stress is it really provides another lens on just how strong our mobile business is. There are other factors that affect the TAC rate including the mix of paid versus organic traffic as well as changes in partner mix and agreement terms. But I think at the, main point of your question here is we do continue to expect Sites TAC to increase, but our focus remains on growing profit dollars and I go back to my comment which is really pleased with the strength of our mobile business, which is benefiting profit dollars even as the TAC percentage increases. And programmatic, kind of a very similar answer which is we're pleased to have a strong position in the growing area.","Sundar Pichai","And questions around Visual Search, when we think about Google Lens, we think about it as a set of capabilities which will roll out across many different products. But we will mainly start getting it in the hands of our users in Q4. I think early days we want to make sure works well for used cases where it can and bet on the long-term trends in computer vision as we make progress there. I also think, there are cases where pulling out your phone and looking at it is a bit cumbersome and so over time as form factors emerge, there its more natural for you to look at and input that into computing you will get used more.","Overall, for humans the way they see, visual input is a very high bandwidth way of communicating and so, it's important that we bring that in computing. So, long-run I'm very bullish on it, but we're going to roll this out slowly and thoughtfully.","Mark Mahaney","Thank you, Sundar. Thank you, Ruth.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Peter Stabler","Thanks so much for the question. One for Sundar, at Marketing Next your team unveiled new ways that Google is leveraging consumer intense signals across your billion user plus platforms. It seems that some of the walls between product data silos are being lowered a bit, one of the obvious gains that [Street Harp] [ph] highlighted was search personalization. Wondering if you could speak broadly to the opportunity and looking at data from a targeting perspective more holistically across platforms? Thanks so much.","Sundar Pichai","I think it's important we have always felt as marketers when they spend and try to reach users, the more we can give them visibility about how their spend is working and they can attribute across all the stages of the funnel. I think that will really help make everything work well. So, we have always taken the long-term view. And everything we do be it store versus which we did a while ago or more recently at Google Marketing Next we talked about Google Attribution as well. So, all that starts adding up and I think pushes in this right long-term deduction. And there is more work to be done. But, I think as users use our -- use everything across multiple products and devices in a thoughtful way, I think making all of this work well, we see it as an opportunity ahead of us.","Peter Stabler","Thanks Sundar.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Brian Nowak","Thanks for taking my questions today. I have two. The first one you talked about micro moments throughout the course of the year and micro moments on mobile. I was wondering, could you give us a couple of examples of micro moments or searching verticals where you have really seen an increase in your monetization over the last year.","And Sundar, as you look out across all the search verticals, what are the two biggest one or two used cases you still see to improve the overall relevancy of search results and potential monetization?","Sundar Pichai","On the first one, I would probably be rather than be very specific, any time people are looking to buy, find, go do things, you could be looking for a local pizza or you could be buying -- we see craze like jeans near me and people are looking for jeans next to them. So these are all very, very specific things and in all of these cases, we have found we have been able to impact the experience for both users and advertisers.","So, I think that applies generally broadly, in terms of all the verticals, I think there are a lot of opportunities local has been an area of strength for us. We have seen a lot of traction and continue to think as a vertical given the assets we have built over the years we can continue to invest more and do better for our users.","Brian Nowak","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Ross Sandler","Great. I have two questions for Sundar. First is, as you mentioned 15% yield improvement on publisher yield for [indiscernible] from machine learning, is there a comparable step inside of Google owned and operated search or YouTube after implementing machine learning you saw yield improvement of x, be curious hear to that.","And then, the second question is, if you look out into the future, you guys mentioned 2 billion Android actives I\/O and you mentioned 11 apps per user in your prepared remarks. Is Google forced to unbundle their own apps from Android in the future. What's the strategy to ensure that maps and YouTube and search get distribution and Android doesn't kind of go the way of China and other markets, be curious to hear that? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","Let me take the first one first. On machine learning, we definitely machine learning we have been using it on search, Rank Brain has become one of the important signals in addition to the many other signals and search. And so, definitely that's had an impact same on YouTube across the board. I don't have any specific metrics to give but we definitely are seeing impact and we think we are in early days of the impact we can see.","In terms of Android, we are obviously thoughtfully building Android out and scaling it out and we offer our apps as part of it. OEMs get to distribute other apps as well. We think it's a very open market, open ecosystem works well for everyone involved and I expect that to continue. And a lot of our products which are successful on Android happen to be successful outside of Android as well including on the web. These are products generally used by billions of users and by now we have worked hard to earn that trust and scale and so I'm confident we can continue scaling this up.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Salmon","Hey, good afternoon everyone. Sundar, I think the last update we heard publicly on promoted places on maps was in December when you announced that you would be beginning some limited tests. I don't think there has been any public comment from the company since then quite frankly haven't heard a whole lot anecdotally about it either. So, I was just hoping for a quick update on that product? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","Overall, I mean it's in the area where we are still like really focused on improving the consumer experience I think. We are evolving maps to be a lot more beyond just driving directions and users are responding to it. And I think we are in the process of making all that work better. And also, we've also focused in terms of what we see as local opportunity within search as well. But, we will continue testing and evolving, I think we want to make sure we get the consumer experience right before we invest before on promoter opportunities on maps.","Dan Salmon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Justin Post","Great. A few for Ruth. First, I'm wondering if you could comment at all on the cloud business profitability, medium or long-term, how you are thinking about that. Second, I would go ahead and take a short at the EC decision lately, clearly it is material for financials. How are you thinking about approaching that decision, and does that impact any of your other advertising businesses as far as innovation? And then finally, any thoughts on verticals that were strong this quarter that supported the organic revenue growth? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","So, on -- as you know, we don't break out by product, just adding a bit more color on cloud. We are clearly excited about the opportunity we have here and it does continue to drive sizable revenue growth as I said in my opening comments as did Sundar and we are seeing momentum in the business. I think the comment that Sundar made about the number of new deals over 500,000 increasing 3x year-on-year gives you an indication of the momentum in the business. It's obviously not a financial forecast but it does display the traction we are having with cloud in the market and GCP remains one of the fastest growing businesses across Alphabet, G-suite continues to have strong growth.","So, we are really pleased with what that means for both the longer term trends in the profitability. We do believe that from -- the many years of investment we have already made and things like technical infrastructure and security which operate with tremendous efficiency that provides us with a benefit, but near term we are investing meaningfully in sales and engineering service support -- continuing to expand out regions to make sure that we are delivering the best experience for our enterprise customers and that's what we are really focused on.","In terms of I think your second question was the EC there was really not much of an update there, we are still early in our analysis of the decision in the right next steps and we do have time to notify the commission of proposed remedies as well as implement changes. The main thing is, we are very focused on helping users and advertisers and our reviewing our options it's an ongoing matter. So, there is not much more to comment on that one.","And then, the third question --","Justin Post","On verticals that were strong?","Ruth Porat","Yes. In terms of -- I think that what you are trying to get out here on what are seeing in particular with sites revenue and there is not anyone thing to call out whether it's by vertical or steps that we are taking. And that's really what I would point you to more. I think it's an important point that we are very excited about the opportunities here given both the underlying secular trends broadly with mobile. Sundar talked a lot about that. But, also all that we are able to layer on top of it just given the engineering acumen here and we talked about this on prior calls, it's true again here this quarter that one change has been driving the results and so what you are seeing is the combined benefit of a number of changes we have made. It's really this maniacal focus on all elements of the user and advertiser experience and nothing to call out by vertical.","Justin Post","Thank you, Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May of Citi. Your line is now open.","Mark May","Thanks for taking my questions. I think this first one is for Sundar. Data of course is a key differentiator and there is a lot of advertising, so maybe you could talk about how you've changed your use of Google search data and recently in areas outside of search and how that is or might impact the effectiveness of advertising on channels like YouTube and others outside of search?","And then, Ruth, in your prepared remarks you mentioned tremendous growth in mobile search in the quarter, I think that's a more emphatic statement in recent quarters, hoping that maybe you could provide more color on some of the areas where you are seeing the change and quite trajectory coming from within mobile search? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai","On your first question, obviously, we do these things with the foremost thing being making sure, we do the right things for user privacy. But, within our own products we are trying to help users get a better experience across on the consumer side and the advertising side and I think there is opportunity there. And so, we will be thoughtful as we move forward.","Ruth Porat","And then on mobile search, I think what you are hearing is, we are really pleased with the ongoing efforts there and as I just said there was not one change that really drove this, what extraordinary about the team is, with the focus on users and advertisers, what is it that is most useful Sundar has spoke about some of them with local, but it's really again -- it's a lot of small incremental efforts that in the aggregate continue to enable us to benefit from what\u2019s a really nice underlying secular trend here. And that's what we are seeing in the results again.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from --","Mark May","Nothing around, are you listening to this? It's something around like geography or platforms or\u2026","Ruth Porat","Not sure, if that was directed to me or but in terms of geography I think hopefully one of the benefits the way we recast the data here last quarter was, so you can actually get a bit more insight into what's going on around the globe. And that's why I made the comment that we are having a really broad strength globally. You can see it in each one of the regions here. U.S. continues to deliver strong growth engagement across products, if you look at EMEA on a fixed FX basis up 21%, you can see the same in APAC, the same in other Americas. So, yes, there is broad based strength across geographies and I think -- I'm not calling out one particular area because the -- what you are seeing here is the secular trend I have used that term a couple of times now. And we are continuing to benefit from that around the globe. And we are continuing to benefit from on top of that the efforts of our team.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Steven Ju","Okay. Thank you. Sundar, I was just wondering if you could give us some sense of advertiser option particularly among your retail appliance the store visit product, as it seems like there has been a large opportunity to drive offline purchasing. And Ruth, can you give us some sense of any headwinds you might be seeing in your streams of your revenue away from Play or GCP in the LNO revenue line as we have just knocked that across and just seeing a sequentially flat revenue line there. Thanks.","Sundar Pichai","I think I spoke about it in my opening remarks. But, since [indiscernible] measurement was announced three years ago advertisers have mentioned over 5 billion store visits globally. And I think we are just doing -- we have just badly scratched the surface. But, our marketing next in May we announced that the store visit measurement will also rollout for YouTube TrueView campaigns and we will be rolling out store sales measurement in the coming months. So, advertisers can actually measure in-store revenue, store visits delivered by search and shopping apps.","So, we have had good proof points advertisers who have used it, for example, Virgin Holidays used it, factored in store sales measurements and they realized their search campaigns generate double the profit comparatively looking at online KPIs alone. So, I think there is a lot of opportunity there. And so, we will do more by over time.","Ruth Porat","And then, you asked on the other revenue line it was up nicely again this quarter 42% year-on-year and that obviously includes the impact of FX. It's obviously a mix of businesses including some of our bigger investment areas, most notably cloud and hardware and as I said at the outset Play continues to perform really well.","I think if you are asking about the quarter-on-quarter sequentially you noted, we are talking about a mix of businesses that have different characteristics and just state the obvious Play is more hit driven. It's highly seasonal, hardware is also seasonal. So, the year-on-year provides a better sense to the dynamics of the business and that's where you can see in this line up year-on-year really nicely this quarter.","Steven Ju","Okay. Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Colin Sebastian","Thank you. Maybe just one question for Sundar. I wonder if you could update us on your thoughts regarding the conversions of Chrome and Android operating systems. And in particular I'm curious whether the emergence of Google Assistant and Voice as a corollary across devices is a reason to move forward more integration between the two platforms. Thanks.","Sundar Pichai","Look I'm -- I mean we have been thoughtfully doing it in putting users first and I'm excited at how Android apps are coming to Chromebooks and we see that as a great opportunity and I think that will help us deliver a very compelling experience. And we just have started doing at this year and I expected to really get momentum as we go through to the next year.","So, that's an example of conversions and I think that will work really well and so. And in terms of products like Google Assistant and Voice, I think we will make sure for users it doesn't matter and they work across every platform they use including our platforms as well as other people's platform. So, we think about making sure our services free as many users as possible and so we are working on that as well.","Colin Sebastian","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of John Blackledge of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","John Blackledge","Great. Two questions, so for Sundar or Ruth, within cloud could you talk about your view of G Suites enterprise penetration right now, kind of key drivers of the adoption longer term. And if you view it as a potential differentiator for Google Cloud versus other large competitors. And then, within YouTube 60 minutes per day of viewing on phones and tablets obviously incredible at that scale. Any thoughts on kind of what could drive further material viewing or engagement growth over time? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","And maybe on YouTube I would say, YouTube is one of those products which is scaling really well globally just like search did and we are seeing real strong growth on mobile. And we are seeing real strong growth for YouTube on emerging markets as well. And we are seeing real strong growth on television.","So, if I look at YouTube on mobile on emerging markets on larger screens, they all look like newer opportunities and so I think there is a lot more growth ahead.","And on cloud, I think we have kind of answered it. Obviously, we see differentiated strengths and machine learning, data analytics, security and reliability. And the combination of not just GCP, G Suite working together with GCP, we are seeing increasing win rates and option across enterprise customers. And I also think all the investments we are doing in terms of broadening our ecosystem including the newer partnerships with the companies I mentioned earlier that should begin to payoff.","And overall, the return on investment from the hiring and region expansion we are doing. So, I think we are set-up incredibly well and look forward to the momentum ahead.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks.","Ellen West","Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2017 call. Thank you and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"1340":["Google Inc.

Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded.","At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ellen West, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen West","Thanks so much, Jamie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Patrick Pichette and Omid Kordestani.","As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.","Now, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking including statements regarding Google\u2019s future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.","Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and, as applicable, other special items. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Ellen. And welcome to 2015 everyone. Before we get into the numbers, I am going to give a brief overview of our performance this quarter, as the data is actually quite noisy through the P&L. So to start, let\u2019s say, that we saw continued strength in our core advertising business. This was really driven by a strong holiday and mobile performance from our Sites line. We saw a great momentum in our programmatic business highlighted by our mobile display and our ads platform product. But we also faced a few real challenges as well.","On the revenue side, clearly as you heard out the strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in a gross negative currency impact of $616 million just into Q4. But thanks to our hedging program the net impact was actually attenuated, with a net revenue impact of $468 million. Also on the Other Revenue line not only did we see that negative currency impact really impact the Play growth, particularly in Japan, but also while the Nexus 7 was very well received as a new phone, we had real issues and unable to secure sufficient inventory to meet the demand that we had forecasted. So for both these factors in fact, we see lower other revenue growth this quarter.","On the expense side, we had number of unusual charges to our operating expenses hit this quarter. I\u2019ll provide you more details in a few minutes as we go through the conversation. But together these items added up to slightly over $300 million in expenses to our P&L.","Lastly, if you go through the CapEx line, you will note that we\u2019ve made real estate purchases in Q4, which helped us relieve both pressure on our work space for current employees but also to accommodate our future growth. And this also resulted in a large sequential increase in our real estate capital expenditures this quarter. So now that you have the basics, why don\u2019t we dive into the details?","Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $18.1 billion, and it was up 10% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations our gross consolidated revenue growth would have, in fact, been 18% year-over-year. And despite all the FX pressure our Google Sites revenue was up a healthy 18% year-over-year to $12.4 billion, was up 10% quarter-over-quarter, in part driven by the strength in our mobile search.","Network revenue was up 6% year-over-year at $3.7 billion and was up 8% quarter-over-quarter. As a reminder, our network business includes really two types of businesses with different growth profiles, our legacy AdSense business, particularly AdSense for search, where we\u2019ve continued to make policy changes for the benefit of our user experience, but which has negatively impacted the growth in clicks specifically.","Our clean-up efforts have resulted in fewer clicks, but also higher CPCs as I\u2019ll discuss in a minute. The other business that in the network line are newer display and programmatic businesses including AdMob, AdExchange, DoubleClick Bid Manager, and these continue to grow at a strong rate. Finally, Google\u2019s other revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $2 billion was up 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by year-over-year growth in our Play Store, but offset by the FX impact and the challenges in our hardware business I mentioned earlier.","Our global aggregate paid clicks were up 14% year-over-year, and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate CPCs were down 3% year-over-year and also down 3% quarter-over-quarter. And if we go on our monetization by property, the Google site paid clicks were up 25% year-over-year and up 18% quarter-over-quarter. With Google sites\u2019 CPCs were down 8% year-over-year and down 8% quarter-over-quarter.","On the network side, network paid clicks were down 11% year-over-year and down 7% quarter-over-quarter, but our network CPCs were up year-over-year 6% and 10% quarter-over-quarter for the reasons I mentioned. Our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by a number of factors. They include geographic mix, device mix, property mix, FX, as well as ongoing product and policy changes.","Turning to geographic performance, if you go to our earning slides, which you\u2019ll find on our Investor Relation website, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve broken down our revenues by US, UK and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations. So despite large currency headwinds we saw solid performance from our core advertising business around the world. The US revenue was up 14% year-over-year to $7.9 billion. The UK was up 10% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. And in fixed FX term it actually grew to 11% year-over-year.","Non-US revenue excluding the UK was up 18% year-over-year to $8.6 billion, accounting for 47% of total revenue.","And in fixed FX terms in fact the rest of the world grew at healthy 24% year-over-year. So let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.6 billion or 22% of advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other costs of revenue was $3.1 billion in Q4, which exclude SBC as well. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $5.8 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation. And as a result our non-GAAP operating profit was $5.6 billion and non-GAAP operating margins were 31% in Q4.","As I mentioned at the beginning, we had a number of unusual operating expenses that impacted us this quarter. We typically review our estimates accounting policies and balance sheet on an ongoing basis and make adjustments when we think and see it necessary. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t call out these, but because they totaled slightly over $300 million this quarter, I wanted to give you some sense of these adjustments, although I won\u2019t be providing a lot of detailed break-out.","So first we took approximately half that amount in compensation charges resulting from a one-time payment and reclassification between SBC and bonus expense. The other half came from a review of our real estate portfolio, where we decide to take write-down on a small number of assets and also one-time payment to buy out a number of leases in a couple of markets where we face acute space pressure.","Headcount was up, but just over 2,000 in Q4. In total we ended the quarter with approximately 53,600 full-time employees. You\u2019ll notice also that our effective tax rate was 16%, again another discrepancy for Q4, which was really, primarily impacted by the extension of the R&D tax credits for 2014 with the entire credit being taken in Q4. As well as continued mix shift from earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.","Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $128 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging programs. For more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.","We are pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.4 billion. Our CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion. And this quarter, most of the CapEx was spent on related to facilities, production equipment, and datacenter construction in that order. So as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we have been opportunistic about acquiring space in real estate where we need to relieve pressure and accommodate for future growth.","To that end, our facilities expenditure included just over $900 million of real estate investments during the quarter, of which $585 million was related to the acquisition of our property in Redwood City that we disclosed in our 10-Q for the third quarter.","Our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, and I also want to note that we completed in Q4 the sale of Motorola Mobile to Lenovo in October 29. We recognize a gain on disposition of $740 million net of tax, which is included in our net income from discontinued operations. So there you have it, despite a noisy quarter from a P&L perspective. We can say that we had strong results in our core business as evidenced by our 18% fixed FX growth this quarter and are well-positioned for the year ahead in the long-term.","As Larry says, although the vast majority of our resources in time continue to be invested in our core products, we also have enthusiasm to invest in new promising ideas like Self-Driving Cars or Loon. We use the same disciplined approach to these new areas that we used for investing in our earlier bets like Android or Chrome or Display.","Our projects start with small dedicated teams that are given clear milestones to hit before they can get further investments. And in cases where we achieve success against our milestones, we expand our investments, and you saw this as an example earlier this week with our Fiber teams. We greenlighted 18 cities in four metropolitan areas in the U.S., out of the 34 cities and 9 metros that we had reviewed in 2014, and they\u2019re off to the races.","In other cases, when the teams aren\u2019t able to hit hurdles, but we think there are still a lot of promise. We might ask them to take a pause and take the time to reset their strategies, as we recently did in the case of Glass. And in those situations our project don\u2019t have the impact we had hoped for, we do take the tough calls. We make the decision to cancel them and you\u2019ve seen us do this time and time again.","So before I turn it over to Omid, I\u2019d like also to note that in many ways 2014 was a year of significant investment growth, both in CapEx and OpEx at Google. From an investment perspective, we\u2019ll continue to seek a healthy balance between growth and discipline and the willingness to throw a little back when we reached the limits of what we believe we can manageably absorb. So with that in mind, I\u2019ll take it over to Omid now to provide more specifics on the successful performance of our core and new businesses.","Omid is joining us by phone from another location today. So I hop it over to you, Omid.","Omid Kordestani","Thanks, Patrick. Hi, everyone, happy New Year. And thanks for joining us today. This is Omid. It\u2019s my pleasure to join you from London tonight. I\u2019m glad to be here to reflect on the last quarter and look ahead to 2015.","2014 ended with healthy momentum enabling us to achieve $66 billion in revenue for the year. In Q4, we launched Lollipop, our newest version of Android, refreshed our line of Nexus devices and introduced Inbox by Gmail, a new inbox that enables users to focus on the messages that matter most to them.","Meanwhile our sales teams worked diligently with our advertising partners to deliver a strong holiday season. Today, I\u2019ll do a quick walkthrough of the business highlights from Q4. First, I\u2019ll give an overview of the different sectors of our ads business, performance and brand advertising and our advertising platforms. Then I\u2019ll cover progress in our emerging non-ads businesses.","Let\u2019s begin with the performance advertising. We continue to evolve the foundation of Google\u2019s advertising business to reflect a multi-screen constantly connected world. Mobile is now a behavior, not a device, and it has a variety of unique characteristics.","First, let\u2019s talk about local advertising. On mobile, consumers want to know about the stores and goods near them. We launched some exciting updates last quarter. In October, we announced local availability for product listing ads and local store front, products that give customers real time information about goods that are in stock close to where they are.","Major retailers like Macy\u2019s and REI took advantage of these local inventory ads during the holidays. Overall, we saw strong engagement and results from big-box retailers during the holiday season. A second priority has been the creation of new measurement tools. We recently added estimated store visits to our estimated total conversations measurement suite. Now, advertisers can see a reliable estimate of the number of times a search ad click drive the store visit.","During the holidays, ULTA Beauty reported that 12% of clicks on search ads led to a store visit with significant gains in ROI from their AdWords search marketing spend. These mobile-specific metrics help advertisers measure the full impact of their mobile marketing.","The third area of progress is apps. We have driven hundreds of millions of app downloads on Google Search, AdMob and YouTube. And this business continues to grow at a healthy clip.","During the holiday season, Office Depot used Google Search Ads to promote their ElfYourself app that helps shoppers create videos of people re-imagined as dancing elves. By using Google Search Ads they saw a 65% conversion rate. We have recently enabled users to more seamlessly navigate between apps and the web and find what they are looking for in apps more quickly.","In organic search 15% of signed-in users\u2019 searches on Android now return deep links to apps. We also offer app deep linking in search ads. Booking.com uses Google Search Ads to drive installs and reengagement via deep linking for their mobile app.","Last quarter, we continued to see great traction with our established mobile advertising products as well, particularly Google Shopping. Online growth remains strong with Google Shopping traffic on mobile devices up nearly 100% compared to Q4 2013. For much of the holiday season mobile shopping clicks exceeded those on desktop as users increasingly made purchase decisions on the go.","Now, I would like to turn to YouTube, where we continue to deliver great results for brand advertisers. YouTube now has more than 1 billion users. Everyday people watch hundreds of millions of hours of video on YouTube, generating billions of views. Watch time is up 50% year-over-year. We continue to invest in our YouTube Partners and Partner revenue has increased by more than 50% year-over-year. We are seeing great momentum in mobile advertising on YouTube. Mobile revenue on YouTube is up more than 100% year-over-year.","TrueView, where advertisers pay only if someone watches their ad also continues to do very well. Walmart U.S.\u2019s holiday performance is one of many success stories. During the week of Black Friday, they used YouTube\u2019s TrueView format to drive a 300% week-over-week increase in views of their channel and more than 28 million views on the week.","This was a 600% increase in YouTube channel views over the same week in 2013. And while we are all anticipating a certain football game in Arizona this weekend, the action has already begun for its advertisers on YouTube. Nearly 70 ads or teasers related to the big game have been posted to YouTube this year, up 55% from the same time last year. People have been - people have already watched them more than 44 million times, up 25% from last year and for more than 70 million minutes on YouTube nearly tripled the watch time compared to the same point last year.","On average people watch each ad for more than a minute-and-a-half. We continue to develop the tools that make digital work for brand marketers, their agencies and premium publishers.","There were two particular areas of focus from Q4 that I would like to highlight, programmatic and measurement. Let\u2019s start with programmatic. Automated ad buying has benefitted performance-driven advertisers for years. We\u2019re now extremely well positioned as brand advertising shifts to programmatic as well.","We\u2019re seeing great traction overall from our advertising and agency partners. Today, all the top 10 global agencies use at least one product in our double click suite. Specific products within the double click suite have shown exceptional momentum. DoubleClick Bid Manager, our primary frontend for programmatic buying has doubled in volume over the past year.","During the recent us mid-term election, programmatic represented nearly one-third of advertisers\u2019 Google ad budgets.","We\u2019re seeing that video, the ultimate brand medium, is starting to move to programmatic as well. After launching in June of 2014, Google Partner Select, our premium programmatic video marketplace now has more than 50 publisher partners including Hearst Television, and Food Network, and includes brands like BMW.","Next, we continue to invest in measurement tools that enable advertisers, agencies and publishers to better understand the results of their digital marketing. It starts with addressing the question of viewability. Nothing else matters if a human did not see your ad. This is the top question for the industry and at Google we are doing our part to address it.","Since July, we have been rolling out viewability report across our ad platforms, so that brands will know whether their video ads on digital channels were actually seen or not. We recently extended this activity reporting to video ads.","Large advertisers are finding technology like this to be very useful. For example, Kellogg\u2019s used DoubleClick Digital Marketing to buy their inventory programmatically and increased their ad viewability by 70%.","Once a brand knows that their ads have been viewed they need to determine if the right people saw those ads and if they made an impact. That\u2019s where our tools to measure brand lift come in. We have run more than 6000 brand lift surveys to help determine brand recall and purchase intent.","For example, Mondelez wanted to measure the effectiveness of a recent digital campaign for the launch of a gum brand. With brand lift they found a 36% lift in brand awareness versus a control group, and a 97% lift in ad recall versus a control group. Getting these types of feedback in real time is impossible with offline media. This sets digital apart.","Let\u2019s move now to our emerging non-ad businesses. Google for Work had a great quarter. We started working with PwC to help them and a company they advise used Google for Work to move their businesses to the cloud. Cloud Platform continues to make good progress. We hosted our second Google Cloud Platform live event in November where we announced several new products such as Google Container Engine.","Our digital content businesses are strong. I\u2019m excited about Google Play\u2019s development. Movies are now available in more than the 102 countries, music in 58, and books in 65. It\u2019s growing internationally at unprecedented speed. In December, we partnered with Sony to digitally release the interview. It has been publicly reported that the film generated over $15 million in its first weekend, and that Google Play and YouTube drove the majority of those sales.","We launched YouTube music key beta a monthly music subscription service that provides ad free music, background play, and offline viewing. This will also include a subscription to Google Play Music with more than 30 million songs, expert queue rated play lists, and more. Our hardware efforts demonstrate momentum just in time for the holidays we launched the Nexus 6, Nexus 9, and Nexus Player devices.","Chromecast continues to be a hit. Just last week, we saw our 1 billionth tap of the cast button. Chromecast usage per device has increased by 60% since launch due to a growing roster of new apps and features.","According to NPD Retail Tracking Service, in 2014, Chromecast was the number one selling streaming media device in the U.S. Chromebooks are now available in 33 different markets and enjoying strong success in K-12 education market in the U.S. I continue to be impressed by the work of our marketing teams that they\u2019ve done around the world. The Year in Search has become an instant classic and YouTube Rewind is fast becoming one.","From the Android Be Together Not the Same Campaign to Nest\u2019s first TV ads and much more our marketing team contributed to our success in the all-important Q4 to a wide variety of efforts.","That\u2019s the wrap for 2014, and we are excited for what lies ahead in 2015. In closing, I want to thank our great partners, customers, and users, without them, we wouldn\u2019t be successful. Thank you all so much.","Now, let\u2019s get back to Patrick for Q&A.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Omid. Before we turn to Jamie for Q&A, I was highlighted by the team here that, I actually had a slip, I said Nexus 7 instead of Nexus 6. And although the Nexus 7 is still a great device, what I really meant in my comments was to talk about the Nexus 6, which is this amazing device that we have launched with the Lollipop launch.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it to Jamie, and we\u2019ll go to Q&A. Jamie, if you can give the instructions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju","Okay, thanks. So Patrick or Omid, I think, it\u2019s been a few years since you talked to the Street about the run rate of your Display business. I wanted to see if you are willing to toss us a nugget here in terms of what your gross billings currently maybe, recognizing that you may be seeing growth in that revenue contribution depending on different products. And also it looks like the UK revenue saw modest bit of acceleration on an FX neutral basis, granted comps were probably modestly easier, but anything you can call out that would help there? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Yes, sure. It\u2019s Patrick here. So on both topics, on the UK, we did see a good performance this quarter on UK versus last quarter, and as you said - mentioned, a 11% year-over-year. So the note of the UK is, the core business there is doing well. If you go back to last the deceleration, we have - it\u2019s a big portion, it\u2019s like 10% of our revenue, and we over 10%.","The - you will remember that in our mix of products that are in the UK, clearly, our core products are there, but also AFS, like the network business is actually prominent in UK, as well in the U.S. less so in the rest of the world. And so that has an issue on the mix. And then also think of it as a promising item, which is, there is areas of new products, such as Play that are actually stronger international than they would be in the UK or in the U.S. So there lies some of the differences between the growth rates, but in many ways a lot of opportunities there, so that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in the UK, quite pleased with the progress there in Q4.","And then on the issue of Display, we haven\u2019t updated the numbers to the Street. And so we have to continue to, kind of, give you the updates that we do, and if we actually have a chance in the future then we\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s time to do so. So thanks for your questions, Steven. And we\u2019ll go to the next question, please. Jamie?","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner","Hi, thank you. Two questions, if I may, Patrick. You hired 2,000 people this quarter versus 1,700 in the same quarter last year, which is a 22% increase. But Google management talks a lot about the opportunity in front of the business. If that\u2019s the case, why aren\u2019t you hiring more people and spending more in R&D. Can you tell us what are the specific constraints that you guys have or imposed on yourselves that prevent you from hiring 3,000 people this quarter instead of 2,000? That\u2019s the first one.","The second is the following, a few quarters ago, I seem to recall you saying that, you did not manage the business for margins, but you managed it for profit growth. Yet your operating income is down year-on-year and even if you are, the $200 million is growing very slowly. You could see how investors would look at that and say, well, how do you reconcile these things? How do you think investors should think about this trajectory of operating income growth? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Okay. So let\u2019s take them in - each in step. On the issue of hiring, you will notice that relative to last quarter also, which is our third quarter is typically a big quarter, because we get the influx of the hires we do at colleges and otherwise. We actually decelerated from the third quarter as well. What we are managing for is, we just have a very high bar for hiring, if you can pass the bar, then we hire you. We also have capacity constraints on leadership, because there is a natural kind of number that you can kind of absorb within the culture of Google, it\u2019s really important not to lose that culture and to have a velocity, to have traction.","So there is no sense bringing 5,000 people that we couldn\u2019t kind of bring into the teams and really make them perform it. So what we manage on the hiring is, we have our plans, and so we have a rate of targets of hires per each of the pals and the areas of the company. And then from there, the next hurdle is really about, can we find these people?","And then finally, just making sure that we keep this kind of balance of bringing at a reasonable rate, so that we can actually absorb them in the company without losing the velocity and the culture of the place. So it\u2019s actually a pretty complex puzzle, but we are managing it, it\u2019s never perfect, but we are managing it, to the best we can. So that\u2019s the first question.","On the issue of margins, look, we have different, if you think of the businesses in Google, we are looking for growth, we are looking for growth in revenue, we are looking for growth in operating profits absolute dollars, and we are looking for great returns on investment. That\u2019s the puzzle we solve for.","So you have an advertising business that may have higher margins, lower capital intensity, than say, another business, which maybe Play, which has much lower margins, great prospect for growth with very large pools of revenue and margins available and we go after them for sure. You have Fiber right, and in the access, which is a completely different kind of capital intensity. But, again, the question is, does it promise, or does it have a case for large dollars operating profit delivery and high revenue and then a decent return on capital, that\u2019s how we manage it.","And to kind of say, okay, well, we have what we have today, but if Play could grow at, just to take the case, ten times faster than it is doing right now, right, it would impact margin, because on the weighted average basis, it would drag it down, but we love it. We love to be able to grow Play ten times faster than we are today. So that\u2019s how we think of the puzzle. We manage them each individually for their potential, their returns, we all look for these big margin pools and these big revenue pools, and then we just allocate our capital to make sure that it\u2019s balanced across these initiatives for maximum velocity. That\u2019s the way we think about it, Carlos.","Carlos Kirjner","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you very much for your question. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.","Anthony DiClemente","Thanks a lot for the question. I have two. Patrick, given the importance of Google stock price as a motivator for existing employees, for recruitment of new employees. I think, many investors out there wonder if we are getting closer to a point where it might be a wise use of resources to return capital to shareholders. Other large tech companies do it, nearly all the media companies do, at what point would you and at what point would the board of Google consider capital returns?","And then second question is, I\u2019m just wondering on the switch of the default browser on Mozilla from Google to Yahoo! in the quarter, and going forward is there any way you can quantify the impact of that? And the investors also wondering, is it possible that could happen for your Safari agreement with Apple? Thanks a lot.","Patrick Pichette","So, why don\u2019t I take the last question first and then the first question. The last question is, you\u2019ve all heard the announcements about Mozilla. And so when we don\u2019t comment on the details of any of our partnerships that we have. Having said that, we continue to do two things that really matter. One is our users continue to actually go in, if they love Google, they will continue to find Google, whichever platform, whichever browser, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve focused on doing.","And then the second piece is the way to win this in the long-term, right, it\u2019s very simple. You just make wonderful products. And when you make wonderful products that are magical people will find them.","And so that\u2019s the strategy that we\u2019re using and we just don\u2019t comment on any of our - we\u2019ve never commented on any of our deals, so we want comment on Mozilla either. And then, for your first question, Anthony, I mean, again I can\u2019t - I just can reiterate the same message that I give on a regular basis, which is share price does matter. It matters to our board. It matters to all of us. We\u2019re all shareholders in the company. And we do review this issue on a regular basis. We review it again responsibly with the Audit Committee, with the board. And I just have nothing to announce today.","Anthony DiClemente","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you so much for your question, Jamie. Let\u2019s go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the questions. One on device mix, which, Omid, you called out. Is there any sense you can give us of whether some of the pricing per ad unit is starting to close from the device mix. So even though you\u2019re giving more volumes from mobile whether be smartphone or tablet we\u2019re starting to see any impact of pricing continues to move up versus desktop pricing you\u2019re seeing across your ad portfolio, would love any commentary around that. And then second, Patrick, you called out the FX impact in the Q4, any help you can give us on how we should be thinking about the FX impact going forward on their a gross or a net basis to the business as you see it versus spot today? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Sure, I\u2019ll let Omid answer the first question then I\u2019ll jump on the second.","Omid Kordestani","Sure. Thanks, Eric for the question. The way we look at this, as I said, we look at mobile and as a behavior today really as - versus a specific device. And people are using screen interchangeably, simultaneously throughout the day. And we really think about the user and the context rather than a particular form factor or device. And similarly in terms of the pricing model here, what we are focused on really building this ecosystem just the way desktop took a long time to develop and have the right ad formats that really took advantage that the platform had to offer. We\u2019re looking at this the same way.","We are developing different kinds of formats, working with marketers on mobile, estimated store visits, app install, app re-engagement ads and cross device conversions. And we really feel good about the traction we\u2019re having and our sales team and advertiser agencies partners are working with us making rapid progress here.","So unfortunate, I can disclose any specific breakdowns, but I can just say that we are very focus on all aspects of this just as we evolve to desktop we\u2019re doing the same in this world. On to you, Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you. On the issue of FX, I think that the most important point to think about in Q4 is - I mean it was material. As I said, it was like on a gross basis over $600 million. You\u2019ve all seen the deterioration of the euro, the GDP, the yen, I mean it\u2019s versus the U.S. dollar. The one thing I would just note from our results in Q4, I mentioned this in the past that, our FX rates are set at Google a month in arrears. So in last week of November we would have set our FX rate for December. So interestingly, the December rates we\u2019ll set January.","And you\u2019ve seen already in December a continued kind of nose dive in certain areas, especially the euro, and the yen. So, all I can say is for all the information we have right now is, that\u2019s not going away.","And I think that everybody should be kind of considering it. On the flipside of that, I just want to kind of reinforce the fact that our FX hedging program continues to do exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do, which is in a low volatility environment we buy insurance. And in moments where we have such shocks like we\u2019re having right now, we did get a lot of benefit out of this hedging program and just as a remainder we hedge profits, right? We don\u2019t hedge revenue. It just happens that we book the profits to revenue, because of the accounting rules.","And so we\u2019ve seen in Q4 approximately $150 million of hedge benefits, which is actually quite a substantial amount on the total $600 million and we\u2019ll continue to have hedge benefits through the course of the year to a certain extent. So I think that from that perspective, right, real hit in December additional, but in a good position from our hedge FX program.","Eric Sheridan","Great. Thank you so much.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you for those questions. Jamie, why don\u2019t we go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler","Great. I had two questions. Patrick, towards the end of the prepared remarks you said that Google show a balance of growth and discipline, and a willingness to throw a little back. Can you just elaborate on that comment? What do you mean when you say that? Are you referring to the pace of expense growth or throwing something back in terms of capital allocation, just a little clarity on that one?","And then, Omid, the question on app indexing, I think you guys said in November that log-in searches have about 15% coverage in terms of app content. Where is that percentage today and when do you guys think it will be closer to 100%? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Ross, let me - it\u2019s Patrick, let me jump in on the first question then I\u2019ll let Omid answer the second.","On the first one, all I wanted to highlight to our investors, shareholders and community at large is, as I said, 2014 was a year of significant investment growth. I mean, we see real potential in so many areas that are exciting to us and where we see great momentum. That - what I wanted to make sure is that, our investors continue to understand that we will push for growth, but in a disciplined manner. And if things don\u2019t materialize in the way that you don\u2019t hit your hurdles, you don\u2019t hit your timing, right, we are actually disciplined to make sure that we don\u2019t have expenses ahead of the curve and we continue to monitor it quite closely.","So in that sense if we see conditions change, it\u2019s really important that you have the confidence that when we manage these investments we do it in the prudent manner, right, optimistic, but there\u2019s always a dose of circumspection to make sure that you get the best bang for your buck in these roll-outs.","And that\u2019s what I really want to kind of communicate and signal to the Street, which is, it\u2019s a balance. It\u2019s always about a balance but given our situation, given all of the results that we\u2019ve had, I mean, 18% year-over-year growth, in our sites if you just look at the sites, which is the core of the business growing 18% year-over-year, despite all the FX headwinds, right?","It just tells you, look, this is a license to continue to invest smartly in the way we do, but I just want to kind of reaffirm to you that we do it in smart way and a discipline manner. We\u2019re driving forward make sure we don\u2019t waste our shareholders money.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Omid to answer the first question, please.","Omid Kordestani","Yes. Thanks, Ross. So as I said in my opening remarks that 15% of signed-in users\u2019 searches on Android now return deep links to app. The way we are focused on this is that we have opened up app indexing to all Android developers, so their apps can appear in searches, also linking directly to the right content in the apps. And it really becomes the job between the developers trying to understand intent and how obviously our research works and determining the best results to provide, including the deep links. We offer this deep linking and search ads as well. Booking.com use Google Search Ads to drive installs and reengagement via deep linking for their mobile approximately, and we are seeing more and more adoption like this by our advertisers.","So, obviously, it\u2019s an area we are going to continue making progress on, we are very pleased to the traction we are having and how mobile monetization is performing. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks for your question, Ross. Let\u2019s go to our next question, Jamie, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.","Benjamin Swinburne","Thank you. Patrick, just going back to return of capital again, there was\u2013 there\u2019s some news today that there is a potential bill to allow repatriation of cash back to the U.S. at a 6% tax rate. I\u2019m wondering, would that impact, how you and the board would think about return of capital, or is that sort of a completely relevant separate point?","And then second, for me - for either of you, any color you can share with us on your wireless ambitions, I think, both on the MVNO side and 3.5 gigahertz, there has been a lot of discussion in the press about what Google is up to, any update you can give us on that, would be great?","Patrick Pichette","So, on the second question, thank you for your questions, Ben. And on the second question that you\u2019ve asked, right, there is a lot of speculation out there. And if we had to answer off every speculation on Google\u2019s part, what\u2019s going on, I mean, we just would be - my PR team would be really busy. So we just won\u2019t comment on any speculative news.","On the first question, on return on capital, absolutely, I mean, we have right now a mix of, kind of, roughly 60-40 between our U.S. 40, international 60 of our cash. We have good use for our cash in both places. But if, in fact, we had a lot more flexibility about repatriating cash, that would make a big difference in the way that we think about it and or, at least, we\u2019d take it in consideration for sure in our dialogue with the board. And so it\u2019s clearly one element, that\u2019s part of the puzzle that we would take in consideration. So if there is anything you can do to get that thing through Congress, Ben, we would really love it and just let us know when that happens.","Benjamin Swinburne","I will call my Congress person. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you so much. All right, Jamie, we are going to go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JP Morgan.","Douglas Anmuth","Thanks for taking the question. You\u2019ve had greater emphasis on e-commerce over the last few years with Google Shopping and Express. I was hoping you could give us an update on Google Wallet and how strategic that is to your business overall and kind of closing the loop payments in general.","And then secondly, can you comment, Patrick, on whether there is just anything in particular in driving the gap that we saw on sites between paid click volume and CPCs beyond some of the normal mix shift issues and FX? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","So why don\u2019t I take the second question immediately, and then I\u2019ll let, Omid, answer the issue of the commerce. So on the first one, look, it\u2019s - I want to come back on the sites issue, because 25% and then the minus 8% in terms of click growth and CPSs. And I want to start with that, because that\u2019s always the case when people kind of just focus on one, they - we kind of tend to forget the big picture, which is, it\u2019s a mix of these two things that give you this revenue that\u2019s been very strong in sites this quarter, so never look at them in isolation.","Having said that, as I said in my prepared remarks, the monetization metrics for sites has all the factors that I kind of usually discuss, which is geographic, device, property, the FX and all the things I talk about. So I think, it would be misguided again this quarter to pin it down to just one trend. I think people have a tendency to say, okay, well, it\u2019s mobile, or it\u2019s FX. And but I would like to point out three things specifically this quarter.","As we know as I already mentioned right, FX has been a big impact this quarter. I also noted the strength of mobile performance in our sites earlier. And I remind you that, our sites line also includes YouTube, where we continue to see impressive growth, both in developed countries and emerging markets.","So, there is the rest of it, there is all these pieces, but these are some of the pieces that we should take note during this quarter. Does that make sense? I will turn it over to Omid, to answer the first question on what\u2019s going on with Google Shopping et cetera?","Omid Kordestani","Yes, on Shopping and commerce in general, then I\u2019ll talk on payments, really our focus is building products that turn consumers\u2019 shopping intents into actions, quickly, easily and enabling businesses to connect and retain these customers. On payments, the goal is really to remove all the friction that one encounters now in the shopping experience. And what we\u2019re really working on here is, move beyond just tap and pay and have a full functional payment system.","Today, users can send to money to friends through Gmail using their wallet app and also just made this functionality available in the UK. Loyalty, gift cards can be stored on the Wallet app to buy with Google button makes it possible for users to purchase with two clicks. So we really are focused on building a rich offering here to make it easier to shop and pay and remove the friction. Thank you, Doug.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you so much for you question, Doug.","Douglas Anmuth","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post","All right. Thank you. I don\u2019t know if you can help us at all, but just kind of overview of core search growth at all, if you can, in some of your mature markets anyway to breakdown that at all? And then as you think about the search improvements you\u2019ve made, just a little high level overview, obviously, big changes with PLAs and enhanced campaigns over the last couple of years, didn\u2019t seem like, there was a lot for this holiday, but maybe outline some of the improvements you\u2019ve made recently? And then any - how is your pipeline looking for this year? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Omid, do you want to take that question?","Omid Kordestani","Yes, I\u2019ll start and then we can add more context if you have more color you need, Justin. So in terms of product listing at PLAs, it\u2019s very successful products and we are really pleased with its performance, advertisers are very pleased with it. And we also have local inventory apps that enable merchants to show customers this information in the U.S., UK, France, Germany, Japan, and Australia, and obviously we are going to continue to expand that.","As I said in my remarks, we added estimated store visits in December, and it\u2019s been one year since we launched estimated total conversions. And just to give you some anecdotes with customers, PetSmart saw 10% to 18% of clicks on search Ads led to store visits and they\u2019re now investing more in Ads to reach customers across multiple screens, Famous Footwear nationwide chain have 1,100 stores. They found that 15% to 17% of the clicks on Ads resulted in store visits, and they were able to mix up the products that they promote and there is in-store merchandising strategies by region.","So it\u2019s - for us it\u2019s early to think about the impact of revenue, but we really expect these suite of products to continue to help the advertisers measure at a full value of their online spending and work with us to enhance those. In terms of specific search numbers, we don\u2019t really break that down, and provide any more data on that. Thank you for your question.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Justin. We\u2019ll have - do we have time - couple of more questions, okay. So, Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Mahaney","Hey, thanks. I\u2019ll echo Stephen Ju\u2019s comment earlier, I think it would be great if you broke out that nonperformance advertising at some point in the future that data point would be very helpful. The CPC trends on sites that - they kind of inflected back down after showing a positive trend. It\u2019s kind of hard to think that that\u2019s nothing, but FX, I know, you have this mix of other factors, could you just clarify that, or could you quantify what CPC sites, CPSs would have been year-over-year ex-FX?","And then finally, Omid, could you just talk broadly about YouTube and you\u2019ve come back you\u2019re more engaged with the company, I think, there is bit of a change in management\u2019s approach, I think, the YouTube and how you want to position it, I know it\u2019s a broad question, but could you just talk about what you want to do differently with YouTube, going forward to the next few years? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","So on the first question, why don\u2019t I jump in and then I\u2019ll let Omid talk about Q2. Look, as I mentioned just a minute ago, if you look at the sites CPCs, we purposefully actually don\u2019t point to one item, like I think, it would be tempting to just say, okay, so it\u2019s all FX this quarter, because geography has a big impact. As I mentioned right, the different properties on our sites, YouTube has an impact as well in the sense that\u2019s it\u2019s growing and it\u2019s growing in emerging markets, as well as in its core more developed markets.","I purposefully made the case that\u2019s important to note that, on the mobile side, I think, we see continued strength in mobile. And so from that perspective, it\u2019s always trying to catch-up to the desktop, which itself as always improving, but we see positive trend there. So it is the mix of all these factors and we don\u2019t give down all of the details on a quarter-by-quarter basis, because they just move all over the place. So that\u2019s the answer for that one, Mark. Sorry, that\u2019s not Mark. And then, I\u2019ll let Omid answer the question on YouTube.","Omid Kordestani","Sure. So first of all, in general, just to give you sense of this, as you said, I\u2019ve come back in, I just spent a lot of time CES, here in Europe spending time with customers as well. And there is just tremendous excitement about YouTube, and over 1 billion people come to the service every month and YouTube mobile revenue is up more than 100% year-to-year. And what we\u2019re really after here is finding the click for brand, GRP brand list, other metrics, and advertisers are already running brand list studies about 6,000 of them have done this with that - already with us.","And what\u2019s really unique about this service is the velocity that the creators enjoy to create and deliver content to a worldwide audience, and our investments in the service and the creators just continue to pay back for us. So I know based on my meetings, I spent a lot of time with consumer goods companies at CES with major agencies there. Everybody just wants to do more. There are a lot of success stories the way they engage with us. And for us the challenge frankly is to structure our sales organization, hire the right people to go deeper with these customers with our agencies. And so you\u2019ll just see a lot of success and emphasis from us as we go after the branding dollars.","Mark Mahaney","Thank you, Omid. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you so much, Mark. Jamie, we\u2019re going to take one more question, so if you can turn it on, please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Mark May with Citi.","Patrick Pichette","Mark, are you there?","Operator","And if you check your mute button, sir, we cannot hear you.","Mark May","Hello.","Patrick Pichette","There we are.","Mark May","Right, sorry about that. Two questions please. Could you tell us what your strategy is in the area of digital payments and is there way that you can leverage Android to develop differentiated product in the market.","And then, secondly, sorry, if I missed this. But how should we be thinking about the strategic and the financial importance of search partnerships like, for instance, the Safari deal. And if there is anything that we should be reading into the recent changes at Mozilla, and I think before that Spotlight and Siri search as far as either Google strategy and thinking in this area or its competitiveness in these deals? Thanks. Sorry, it\u2019s a lot, but\u2026","Patrick Pichette","That\u2019s okay, Mark. No problem. So I\u2019ll take the second question, and then I\u2019ll flip it over to Omid to answer the Wallet one. So on the issue of partnerships, Google has a lot of partnerships, right, it\u2019s got - it\u2019s an anchor of our strategy, because that actually gives us distribution, distribution is good. And so we also we look for partnerships in many spaces.","Partnerships have to be win-wins, and in that sense, right, we\u2019ll always look for those combinations. But also at the end of the day, there\u2019s a second piece of the strategy, which is, as I said earlier, building amazing product, because if you build the amazing products then people want to distribute you product.","And so that\u2019s why, we have a meet in the whole search team that actually do this amazing job through the knowledge graph and all of the other elements of search, and no matter what the device, no matter the location, no matter the time of day. If we give you the answer as you\u2019re looking for and 10 clicks less than it was before and then even faster and better all the time, that\u2019s what wins, and that\u2019s the core of what we\u2019re focused on, and then people will find the way to get the Google.","So, yes, partnerships matter. But at the core of it, you need partnership, because you have a phenomenal product. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue to build this amazing company. So I\u2019ll let with that Omid talk about our developments for digital payments.","Omid Kordestani","Hi, Mark, I already addressed this a little earlier, but - so I\u2019ll summarize it again. But we\u2019re really after removing the friction here in all the products to improve commerce and make the experience for our users seamless here. And there\u2019s really two areas we\u2019re focused on; one is really building a full functional payment system that just is beyond tap and pay. So I mentioned that earlier using Gmail and the Wallet App to send money to friends, loyalty and gift cards and buying with Google button with a press of two clicks.","So and we just - the NFC devices are available, and we are really getting closer and closer to broader merchandise option. And so you\u2019ll see us emphasizing that through the devices that we are supporting out there, as well as the payment services and commerce services that we provide. So I think, you will see a lot of progress here as we - as I said try to remove the friction here.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you so much for your question, Mark. Omid, I need to thank you. I mean, you\u2019re at the other end of the world and staying late for us, I think, I just can\u2019t thank you enough for all of your support over\u2026","Omid Kordestani","It\u2019s my pleasure. We\u2019re excited about the year ahead and looking forward to future updates with this group of people. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","For all of you thank you again for your support in 2014. Welcome to 2015, and I couldn\u2019t stop without thanking again all of our partners, our users, and lastly, our employees, all Googlers around the world that make this magic happen every day, couldn\u2019t do it without you, so thank you again.

It\u2019s great to be on the call this afternoon. If you\u2019re listening online, I hope you liked our warm-up video. I heard they had a great time making it. Okay, we had a really strong start to 2013, with Q1 revenue up 31% year-on-year to $14 billion. I want to give a big shout-out to the sales teams that made this all possible. We tend to focus on product and engineering, but our business organization is tremendously strong. They are Google\u2019s unsung heroes.","Over the last two years, we worked hard to increase our velocity, improve our execution, and focus on the big bets that will make a difference in the world. Take Google now, our goal is to get you the right information at just the right time. Launched nine months ago, Now provides boarding passes, delivery updates, and traffic conditions without you having to ask first. In this quarter, we added movie tickets nicely packaged with directions to the theatre. I am also excited about our Voice Search momentum. Looking for the nearest pharmacy, just ask Google for directions, and we\u2019ll deliver them instantly, no typing needed. And you can now ask conversational questions like do I need a jacket this weekend. Voice commands are going to be increasingly important, it's just much less hassle to talk than type.","So in this quarter, we launched Chrome support for Web Speech APIs. Developers can now easily add voice recognition into their web apps. We expect to see a lot of innovation there. The velocity around Google Play is tremendous. It\u2019s a big bet and one that\u2019s fundamental to the success of the Android ecosystem. In our first year, we assigned partnerships with all major movie studios, music labels, and publishers, and our digital content is available in over 20 countries globally, seven of which we launched in Q1, including India and Mexico.","And last week, we released a beautiful new UI with better recommendations, bigger images, and a simpler way to buy things. Play is already a great product and we are improving it at a rapid rate. As devices multiply, it\u2019s really important that our products work seamlessly whatever device you are using at the moment. It's why I love Google Play, the ability to buy books, apps, movies or songs and have them instantly available on your Android devices even when you buy it on the web. When you switch devices while reading, your book opens exactly where you left off. In the same way, we need to make advertising across devices really simple for our customers. Online advertising has developed in a very device specific ways with separate campaigns for desktop and mobile. This makes arduous work for advertisers and agencies, and means mobile opportunities often get missed.","So in February, we launched Enhanced Campaigns, a significant upgrade to AdWords. Nikesh will talk more about that in a moment. But our goal is simple; to enable advertisers to focus on their audience and their message while we dynamically adapt their campaigns across multiple devices. I've been very pleased with the rate of progress so far. We are smoothly moving a huge advertising system and ecosystem on a dime.","In today's multi-screen world, the opportunities are endless. Think about your device. Battery life is a challenge for most people. You shouldn\u2019t need to carry around a charger with you to make it through the day. If your kids spill their drink on their tablet, the screen shouldn't die, and when you drop your phone it shouldn't shatter. There is a real potential to invent new and better experiences, one that are much faster and more intuitive, so having just seen Motorola\u2019s upcoming products myself. I\u2019m really excited about the potential there. In just under a year, they have accomplished a lot and have impressive velocity and execution.","I want to finish up by talking a little bit about the future. We invest the vast majority of our resources and time in our core products as well as our big bets like Chrome, YouTube and Android, but as CEO it\u2019s also super important to keep focused on the future. Companies tend to get comfortable doing what they\u2019ve always done with a few minor tweaks. It\u2019s only natural to want to work on other things you know, but incremental improvement is guaranteed to be obsolete over time, especially in technology, where history has shown that there is a lot of revolutionary change.","So a big part of my job is to get people focused on things that are not just incremental. Take Gmail, when we released that, we were a search company. It was a leap for us to put out an e-mail product let alone one that gave users 100 times as much storage as anyone else. It was the same with Android, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in what appears to be speculative projects to you today such as self-driving cars.","We found that with ambitious goals and a committed team you can make progress pretty quickly. The best people often want to work on the biggest bets and there\u2019s not much competition, because no one else is crazy enough to try.","We started Google Fiber because Sergey thought it will be great to show how high speed Internet access can improve people\u2019s lives. Three years later, our first homes are live in Kansas City, and in the last two weeks, we have announced plans to roll out service in Austin and Provo.","And just this week, after three years of development, we started handing over Glass devices to developers. I get chills when I use a product that is the future, and that happens when I use Glass. Someday, we will all be amazed [that computing involved] [ph] fishing around in pockets and purses.","There are so many opportunities in the world to create technology that makes people\u2019s lives better. We are still only at 1% of what\u2019s possible; we are really just getting started. And that is why I am so excited to be here working hard with Googlers to take our company to the next level. Thank you.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Patrick for some detail.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. So let me dive in by reviewing the details of our overall business financial performance. So here we go.","Our total gross consolidated revenue grew 31% year-over-year to $14 billion in Q1. The overall business was down 3% quarter-over-quarter driven by the softness in Motorola Mobility segment specifically.","Were it not for currency fluctuations, our consolidated revenue would have grown 33% year-over-year or an additional $96 million, but the quarter-over-quarter impact was really immaterial. Google standalone gross revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $13 billion and was flat quarter-over-quarter. Google website revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $8.6 billion flat quarter-over-quarter with strength across most major geographies and industries.","Google network revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $3.3 billion and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter impact was largely due to the effect of advertising policy decisions implemented during Q4 and in Q1 as well. Other revenue grew 150% year-year-over to $1 billion and 27% quarter-over-quarter driven by Play store sales, which also includes both hardware and digital commerce sales.","It\u2019s worth noting that a significant part of the sequential other revenue growth is due to the implementation of an accounting change in our Play app revenue recognition policy. Currency fluctuations had an immaterial impact of Google standalone revenue both year-year-over and quarter-over-quarter.","Turning now to Motorola Mobility, gross revenue was $1 billion. We continue to be very pleased with the velocity of change at Motorola as Larry mentioned. For example, this week we closed our sale of the Home business, as well as the Flextronics outsourcing agreement. We\u2019re seeing a lot of progress across the board in the transformation of the Motorola Mobility. We\u2019re excited about the future, but I wish to remind everyone that results from that segment will continue to be variable.","At Google, global aggregate paid click growth was strong, was up 20% year-over-year and, in fact, up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 4% year-over-year, as well as down 4% quarter-over-quarter. Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q1 CPC growth. And similar to last quarter, as I mentioned, the advertising policy change affecting network revenue continue to lower the aggregate paid click growth and improve CPC growth on a year-over-year basis.","In addition, our monetization metrics continued to be impacted by the usual factors that I\u2019ve covered many times including geomix, channel mix, property mix and product changes.","Turning now to geography and our geographic performance of Google standalone business, we continue to see steady performance across the U.S., the U.K. and the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you\u2019ll find in our investor relations website, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve broken down our revenue by U.S. U.K. and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.","Revenue was up, from the U.S., was up 20% year-over-year to $5.8 billion. The U.K. was up 21% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, which include $20 million of benefits from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the U.K. actually grew 20%.","Non-U.S. revenue excluding U.K. accounted for 44% of our total revenue or $5.7 billion, up 24% year-over-year, which includes a $15 million benefit from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of world in fact grew 27%. So coming back at an aggregate level for total consolidated business, other cost of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q1, excluding stock based compensation and Motorola restructuring.","Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $3.9 billion, which also exclude our stock based compensation and Motorola restructuring. And our non-GAAP operating profit was $4.2 billion in Q1 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 30%.","For standalone Google, traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion or 25% of total advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $2.1 billion excluding $99 million of stock-based compensation. The year-year-over increase was primarily driven by equipment cost including costs associated with the hardware sales on Play, carrier OEM revenue share driven by the implementation of our accounting change in our Play app revenue recognition policy that I mentioned a minute ago and content acquisition costs.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.5 billion excluding stock-based compensation of $556 million in this case and non-GAAP operating profit was strong at $4.4 billion in Q1 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin for the Google segment of 34% for standalone. Lastly, depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment for standalone Google was $520 million for this quarter.","At Motorola Mobility, our total non-GAAP operating expenses including cost to revenues were $1.2 billion. And keep in mind that intangible amortization of expenses attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola Mobility are in fact, included in these non-GAAP measures. Of the $315 million in intangible amortization expense in the quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola of which $116 million was allocated to Google and $37 million was allocated to Motorola Mobility.","And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss for Motorola Mobility was $179 million in Q1 resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of negative 18% for that segment. Let me turn to head count for the consolidated business. In fact, it was roughly flat for Q1. Keep in mind, the consolidated head count includes the Motorola Home and Home comprise roughly one-third of the total Motorola head count. Standalone Google added about 1,200 people and in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter around 53,900 full-time employees. Many of you may have noticed our effective tax rate that was very low at 8% in Q1.","Please note that this quarter, the rate reflects a recognition for the full-year benefit of our 2012 federal R&D tax credit, which Congress extended, but only retroactively in January of this year, so there was a catchup for the full of 2012 in Q1. Additionally, there has been the usual mix shift of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries that continue to impact our tax rate.","Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $134 million, which reflects interest income and realized gains on investments offset by the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense from our hedging program. For more details on those or any again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.","We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $3.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $1.2 billion versus last quarter at $1 billion and the majority of CapEx spend was related to production equipment, data center construction, and facilities related purchases. Our free cash flow was also strong at $2.4 billion and please note that cash flow and CapEx both include the Home business for now.","And before I hand it off now to Nikesh, I want to say a few words about investing in our future and preparing for the growth of our businesses. The success of our products and our continued strong performance as portrayed by Larry\u2019s comments, continued support, our optimism, and our confidence to continue to funding the strategic growth areas. These include not only products like Search or YouTube and Android or Chrome, but also our infrastructure as well.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it off to Nikesh who will cover in more details, our business performance in the quarter. And after his remarks, we\u2019ll open up the phone for questions. Nikesh, all yours.","Nikesh Arora","Thank you, Patrick. Our business is continuing to perform well. We had over $13 billion in Google standalone gross revenue. Our core business is strong across Search and Display including the continued rise of Mobile. I\u2019m particularly pleased by the positive growth we have continued to achieve in Display. Let\u2019s review a few key highlights for the quarter before we talk in more depth about multi-screens, which Larry alluded to in bad advertising momentum.","From a regional perspective, growth was fairly stable across the board this quarter. Asia continues to be our fastest growing region, Southern Europe remains stable despite the continued economic woes in the region. Auto has been a strong sector for us globally and the cold spring in the U.K. has lead to stronger growth in the retail sector there.","Our shopping business continues to expand with over 1 billion products listed. This quarter, we rolled out product listing ads in Europe and also brought them to mobile devices. I want to mention our policy efforts that ensure that we're working with only the highest quality partners, which Patrick has already alluded to. We want to make sure we protect users from having bad experiences with websites and online services. So we\u2019ve tightened our policies and enforcement in few areas like downloadable software applications. While these steps may impact network revenue in the short-term, they're essential in the long-term for a better, safer web experience for users and to encourage brands to invest more in online marketing and in our network. We strongly believe what we've done benefits us in the long-term.","Shifting gears to our Enterprise business, the Enterprise business continues to experience strong growth, across pretty much all products, regions and industries. While our SMB segment is growing steadily, we're seeing significant increase from large global organizations, in fact 58% of the Fortune 500 are now actively using abate enterprise cloud product from Google.","Recent wins include ANA from Japan, the largest airline, Woolworths with over 200,000 users, Australia\u2019s largest retailer, BMW, it will use Google Places and Street View in their ultimate driving machines and the Country of Malaysia, they are adopting Google Apps for 10 million students, teachers and parents. They are going to deploy Chromebooks to primary and secondary schools nationwide.","Moving on to our marketing efforts, our marketing team continues to execute flawlessly. They have helped Chromebooks increase their footprint in the U.S. expanding to more than 1,000 Best Buy stores nationwide, which pretty much doubles the previous number of stores we had. The Samsung Chromebook has been the top selling laptop in Amazon since it launched. We have rolled out Nexus 4 in Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and expanded in the U.S. to 3,000 T-Mobile stores.","I want to focus the rest of my remarks on two continuing trends that present great opportunities for us. First, the shift to consumers to a multi-screen lifestyle and second, the ongoing movement of brand dollars online.","As Larry has said, consumers are accessing content interchangeably on many screens throughout the day. Our clients are hungry to advertise where consumers are. In fact, 95% of our clients have campaigns that run across multiple screens.","In February, working with Susan and Sridhar team we rolled out enhanced campaigns to make it easier for clients to manage and measure campaigns that reach people across devices. Market dealers will be able to deliver ads that are more relevant to the users\u2019 context using features like offers and proximity bidding. And they will be able to do a better job of measuring mobile conversions.","Enhanced campaigns is an important long-term bet that will help market tiers. You know this is a big change for many of our advertisers and we\u2019ve invested tremendous amounts of time and effort into making the transition as smooth as possible. In the first two month since launch, more than 1.5 million campaigns have already been upgraded to enhanced campaigns. And these clients are beginning to see great results.","We expect to migrate all campaigns that we manage by the end of the current quarter. While this is a complicated task, it\u2019s a great example of our focus on flawless execution on behalf of our customers. Now on to brands, we see great remarketing success stories everyday. Nissan, Mexico\u2019s biggest launch of the air, the Pathfinder featured 13 video ads and a new approach to remarketing AdWords of video.","Nissan connected their stories of making sure that users who watch their videos were shown a new one each time. Newer brand-friendly formats like our expandable Lifebox ads, our Reserve inventory solution are helping clients create beautiful experience with sight, sound, and motion. Over the past year, the number of advertisers using our Google Display Network Reserve option has increased four-fold.","Now, we have two-thirds of the top 100 Ad Age brands using those products. This is really helpful in developing deep partnership with our clients especially in the branding arena. For example, we\u2019re now working directly with Adidas in Germany on the new global branding budget. Brands are also continuing to see the power of YouTube to help them reach consumers across the screens.","Today, more than a billion people are finding the channels they love on YouTube every month. Users are now watching over 50 million more hours a day compared to a year ago of 50% increase.","We had a record year for our Super Bowl Ad Blitz program views, votes, watch time and advertiser participation were all up from last year. We saw increased engagement across all screens. We had 1.3 million total hours of watch time of commercials on Ad Blitz, that\u2019s equivalent to the length of 325,000 Super Bowls. More brands are also using YouTube as a strategic part of their campaign to reach the younger generation.","For example, Chevrolet built awareness of the Chevy Sonic, but made for digital videos supported by YouTube and Google Ads, all contributing to successful launch of this all-new sub-compact car.","Our work in brands also helps our publisher partners, our Ad Exchange supports all formats, all screens, and hundreds of publishers and continuing to grow well. We are offering new solutions for publishers like Google Consumer Surveys and Google Play to help them make money from their content.","In conclusion, I want to thank all Googlers who helped deliver a great quarter into our business. This industry is moving very fast and the opportunities are numerous. We\u2019re lucky to have such skilled and hardworking employees to help drive Google and our partners in the future. With that, thank you Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Nikesh. Sean, if you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll start the Q&A section now. So I\u2019ll ask you to give us the instructions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely, thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Mahaney \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, two questions please. First, Patrick, you mentioned this accounting change that I \u2013 could you just give us a little bit more detail on what that accounting change was versus Play? And then could you talk about the TAC trends? I know it\u2019s just one part of your business, but you seem to be moving in different directions on your own sites, continuing to rise pretty dramatically, but on your network partner sites, falling off pretty significantly. Can you just help us think about what that should look like going forward for both of those segments? Thanks a lot.","Patrick Pichette","Yeah, thank you for your question, Mark. Let\u2019s take them in row. First on the apps revenue recognition policy, let me explain what happened there, and I\u2019ll use it with an example if you don\u2019t mind. If you \u2013 and the way we did it is, we changed the revenue recognition. So if you say, you buy an app for $1 on the PlayStore, $0.70 of that dollar will be paid to the developer and does not impact on P&L, it didn\u2019t before and it still doesn\u2019t today. So that hasn\u2019t changed.","In the past though, we would have booked the remaining $0.30 on a net of payments to carriers and OEM and then booked that as gross revenue. Beginning in Q1, however, the entire $0.30 is now booked as gross and the payments for the carriers and the OEMs are now booked on other cost of revenue. So that\u2019s the big change that has happened and basically the reason why we did this is as part, we were looking to the second half of 2012, we were seeing these used to be kind of immaterial numbers for us. And then when we saw through the second half of 2012, we decided to kind of tune our accounting policies and made that change in Q1. So that\u2019s the issue what\u2019s going on the revenue recognition. So you\u2019ll see the impact both on gross and then as I said on other cost of revenue and then you get the net. So on a net basis, it doesn't change.","On the TAC issue that you\u2019ve raised, Mark, the answer is pretty simple, right? If TAC is dropped overall, because of the change in our ad policies that we\u2019ve done through Q4 and Q1, so in pushing hard on implementation of our ad policies to the benefit of the user, the impact of that is actually that it lowered our network revenue, but it also lowered our TAC, which is tied to AdSense partners in that role.","On Google sites, you have noticed that it continues to grow, and it grows because of mobile growth. So the volume of mobile in our mix is driving TAC to go up. So, overall TAC is down for the quarter as an aggregate basis. The ad policy changes have driven them down and then our mobile for our own sites continue to drive them up. But that\u2019s a good story because it means mobile has really continued to be on fire. So that\u2019s the pieces of the puzzle. Thanks for your questions because it wasn\u2019t that easy to understand at first. But I hope that clarifies the point. Thank you, Mark. Sean, to our next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Ben Schachter \u2013 Macquarie Capital Inc.","Larry, in your prepared comments, you spent quite a bit of time discussing the non-core future products. I wonder if you could talk about any changes to the amount of resources being invested in Google X and these products? And also, can you tell us how you determine the appropriate size of the investments in these various teams and products? And then just quickly separately, Knowledge Graph, just in general if you can give us an update on the progress and sort of how you measure that progress internally? Thanks.","Larry Page","Yeah, thanks, Ben for the questions. I feel like every time I say anything I get this question. I think honestly my job as CEO is to get people to do those things. If you look at most companies, they will never do anything different and eventually they run into problems for that reason. So I think that\u2019s the common failure mode. I think the reality is it\u2019s pretty hard to invest significant amounts in new things, because it\u2019s actually difficult to get people to do those things.","So, we have nothing to say differently about our general philosophy of 80% on our core things. I said that in my remarks basically that we\u2019re still focused on our core products and our big bets. And that\u2019s clearly, the vast majority of our resources, and we\u2019ll add resource to the new things as we\u2019re able to and as they show success.","As an investor, I am \u2013 I as a big shareholder of Google, I\u2019m certainly not worried about the expense of that because I don\u2019t think like I said it\u2019s not easy to spend that much money on the new things. I\u2019ll be more worried that we don\u2019t do those things fast enough and build on revolutionary change that happens in the technology industries.","On the Knowledge Graph, I think there\u2019s been tremendous progress there, we\u2019ve done internationalization. There\u2019s a quality improvement and we\u2019re improving the kind of questions we can answer as I mentioned about weather and other things that happens from improvements to our Knowledge Graph, and I\u2019m very excited about that. And I think we still have big investments there and you still for a long time will continue to see improved products there. So can we have our next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. First question for, Larry, I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on the impact of Facebook Home for Android just given some have talked about the possible impact on engagement with other Android apps. And then secondly, and I guess this would be for anyone who wants to take it, I think investors are just wondering about Enhanced Campaigns that you talked about launching in February. should we expect any sort of bumpiness or any sort of near-term dislocation from your advertisers who are starting to become accustomed to Enhanced Campaigns, on boarding to that platform with the understanding in the long-term opportunity of course? Thanks.","Larry Page","Thanks, Anthony. I\u2019ll take the first question there; maybe, I\u2019ll give the second one to Nikesh. I think that Google is really focused on building and creating great Android experiences within the strong ecosystem that we have. And it\u2019s really great to see developers really focused on and building for Android. So I\u2019ll give Nikesh the second question about The Enhanced Campaigns. But I\u2019m certainly, as I mentioned, I think it\u2019s gone pretty smoothly. I\u2019m pretty excited about it.","Nikesh Arora","Yeah, thank you, Anthony. As Larry just said that, it was very complicated. We had to train a sales force around the world and to launch simultaneously and work with our product team. But so far, the feedback we\u2019ve gotten from advertisers is, it is positive, because it basically takes away a lot of work from them and we\u2019ve been able to migrate 1.5 million campaigns to enhanced campaigns. we also have some great suggestions from our advertisers about what we should do to make it better and we\u2019re beginning to implement those. So we\u2019re hoping that towards the end of this quarter, we should have migrated all of the campaigns, which are done separately as mobile and separately the desktop as combined and really offer them the benefits of location, context, screens, all with one campaign. So effectively I think in the long-term that should be better ROI.","Anthony DiClemente \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","Nikesh Arora","Sean, why don\u2019t we go to the next question please?","Operator","Absolutely, your next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Justin Post \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Thank you. My question just is the mobile impact on the business, it looks like your top line revenues have somewhat stabilized. But how is the transition to mobile impacting your kind of high level revenue growth over a period of quarters and also your margins, maybe you could give us a little help on that? And then maybe, Larry, could you address the concern that constantly comes up about people using apps versus a Google Search, obviously, the disclosures you\u2019ve given suggest revenue on mobile is going at or above the industry, but are you seeing any pressure from app usage versus search usage on mobile? Thank you.","Larry Page","Yeah, thank you, Justin. I think, maybe, I\u2019ll take the first one, second one first. You know we always get this question about other apps versus Google Search. I think, I am not super concerned about that issue. I think that people use lots of apps on the web over many strong sites and so on. So we\u2019ve been dealing with that issue for a long time. I think fundamentally search is an amazing thing for publishers and software developers and everybody else and we deliver a lot of traffic and lot of users to things and so, I think in general the information wants to be found and we\u2019re working hard to make sure that the user experience is great and that we are delivering people into the right places. So I think I feel pretty confident on that \u2013 in the future that we\u2019ll get through that just fine. So the second half of your question?","Patrick Pichette","The first part of the question was about top line Mobile versus other impacts on the business and margins. Let me just jump in on this one quickly, and it\u2019s really about the new reality where we have all the multi-screens. And I mean, Larry talked about this at length at the last earnings call where the reality now is it\u2019s not about mobile or tablets or desktop, it\u2019s about this unified life that you have where you\u2019re always connected and the question is are you giving the best answer all the time following me throughout my day.","And that\u2019s why in fact Enhanced Campaigns is a great signal of that; where you\u2019re saying, hey, let\u2019s find the right ad at the right time and the right answer at the right time for you to during your day. So I think that rather than to ask if you know which small piece part is going to kind of contribute plus or minus, the real question is are we growing the pie of your day with Google and in the long-term are we really kind of contributing to create the best answers both for the advertisers and for users, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re actually pushing for.","So I think that this trend really presents to us enormous opportunities and when people ask about what\u2019s going on with TAC Patrick or what do you think the impact of CPC on a very specific basis, I think that that\u2019s the wrong way to ask the question. The real right way is the excitement we have about kind of helping you throughout your day on all your devices, right and the pie grows for everybody. And that\u2019s the right way to ask the question. So thanks for your question on that, Justin.","Justin Post \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Why don\u2019t we go to the next question, Sean?","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Carlos Kirjner \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you for taking my question. I have two. First on Google Fiber, taking aside the user experience for those who get it. How do you expect Fiber to have major impact given that you take many billions and several years to pass, something like 20 million U.S. homes, and after all of that, time and money, you would be at best and mid-sized provider in a market that accounts for less than half of your current business.","Secondly, on the future of Search, Larry you mentioned voice commands in your opening remarks. We already get voice output with Jellybean. Put this together with Google Now and Knowledge Graph and we see our future where you'll get the answer to your question sometimes before you ask it. How do ads come into this view? How do you generate revenues in the world like this where you guys seem to be going to? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Why don't I jump on the first question and I'll let Larry answer the second one. Look, on Fiber, I think it's really simple. It's very early days. We're totally excited about delivering a great user experience with faster than Internet speed. And Gigabit as Larry said with Sergey's kind of quest a few years ago, Gigabit speed over hundred times faster than the average American. I mean, that is a great user experience and it's really about pushing for speed and writing the new chapter, the next chapter of the Internet. So for us I think we really are excited about this and that's really where we're focused on. On the second question, I'll let Larry give his comments.","Larry Page","I'm glad you're very ambitious too, because Fiber industry is not big enough for you so I applaud that. I think, we would love to find businesses much bigger than our entire current business to invest in, but I think there's only a very small number of such companies that even exist. So I think, we look at places where we can provide a lot of \u2013 on Fiber we look at places where we can provide products that can make really big difference in peoples' lives and we can make a lot of money and resources doing it. And I think it certainly meets that criteria, although as Patrick said, it's very early days. On the voice pass and knowing what people want before they ask for it and how do we make ads on that, how do we make revenue and ads on network.","I am not worried about that at all, that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been doing this for a long time and in fact, we really view the reason we\u2019ve been successfully doing advertising is we feel that is another source of information, seeing all the search ads that we show has to be very relevant and make sensitive at that moment. And the more \u2013 the better job we can do in providing you information even with [with regard you\u2019re] asking for it, the better we can also provide commercial information to you that people are excited about promoting to. And I think that\u2019s actually huge, huge opportunity for us. We are all about making things more efficient, marketing the right information to the right people at the right time and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to improve in the kind of world that you are talking about. All right, can we have our next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Scott Devitt \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. I had two please; the first one for Nikesh. You recently discussed the opportunity for online advertising to exceed 50% of total advertising in the next five years and you referenced video and Internet connected devices\u2019 as catalyst, it\u2019s a big number. So I was just wondering if you could talk about that in a little more depth and the way Google products actually service catalyst for that change?","And then secondly for Larry, could you just discuss the transition in Android management and what exactly Andy Rubin is going to be doing now that he has a new role? Thank you.","Larry Page","Okay, Nikesh, you want to take the first one?","Nikesh Arora","Sure. Scott, thanks for your question. I think what I was referring to was the fact that I believe in the next few years, we will see connected TVs everywhere and we\u2019ll be able to address a TV using IP. When that begins to happen, I think the products we have in place, where we can dynamically serve ads, which are more personalized, which look more like information on display platforms or video platforms is going to be very relevant.","So I think over time the television industry shifts to a more addressable, more personalized, more IP addressable type of platform and I think we\u2019re well positioned in that space given our large focus and emphasis on brand, given our huge technology efforts that Susan\u2019s team does in our display and video and really getting our sales force working really well with various brand advertisers around the world. So, we are preparing for that eventuality and we hope it comes sooner than later.","Larry Page","And on the management change question, I think, as we\u2019ve already said, we\u2019ve really exceeded crazy ambitious goals we dreamed of for Android. It\u2019s the most used mobile operating system in the world and a very big thanks to Andy for that. He really decided it was time to hand over the reigns and start a new chapter at Google. And we actually have an outside \u2013 we haven\u2019t said what that is and I\u2019m not going to make news today on that. And actually going forward, Sundar is going to lead Android in addition to his existing work on Chrome and apps. He has a great talent for creating products that are really technically excellent yet easy to use and he loves a big bet too. So, we said how that performed I think we had very smooth transition and of course excited about the future.","Nikesh Arora","Sean, let\u2019s go to our next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Ross Sandler \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Guys, I had a couple of questions about Google Glass. Larry, we had a chance to try out Glass a few weeks ago and we think you guys really nailed it, so congrats to the team. But can you talk about the overall strategy with Glass? How do you plan to build up the ecosystem for the third-party developers? What do you see as the biggest functions that Glass could address for users? And then do you expect the $1,500 price tag to come down to a level that\u2019s more mainstream or is this likely to remain a higher-end luxury device. Thanks?","Larry Page","Yeah. Thanks, Ross. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re excited about Glass. I am too. Now let\u2019s say it is early days on the profit for just, handing over small numbers so far. I think that we\u2019re probably pretty good at third-party ecosystems, our experience on Android and the bunch of other areas. So I\u2019m not too worried about that. There\u2019s been a lot of speculation on that. I would just say it\u2019s early. And I think the price tag was set for developers for an early test.","We don\u2019t have any news to announce there, but it was clearly \u2013 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll call it a luxury price, but certainly a pretty high price. I think that what I\u2019m, like doing with my Glass, I think \u2013 what do people do in Glass? I really \u2013 I find that photo taking and the video, phone calling, quick messaging, directions, all to be a pretty amazing experience and that\u2019s some of the core functionality we built into the device, we\u2019re excited to really get it out to some developers and have other people create some amazing experiences with it, which we haven\u2019t thought of yet. I guess that it\u2019s still early days. But I think it\u2019s very exciting. Our next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Brian Pitz \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Thanks. You mentioned expansion in the PLA ad format during the call. Would you give us a sense for how maybe CPCs on these PLAs compares to the overall average and what kind of trends you're seeing? And perhaps any comments on the current mix of CPC versus cost per action or convergence and any kind of incremental data on how they perform? Thanks.","Nikesh Arora","Hi, this is Nikesh. So I guess on DLA so far we're very excited, we have a whole billion items in the product listing ads and we just launched it in Europe. It's too early for us to share numbers around that topic, but so far all I would like to say is, it's been neutral. There has been no impact that we\u2019d like to share at the current moment.","Brian Pitz \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay.","Patrick Pichette","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Douglas Anmuth \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks for taking the questions. Just want to ask two things. Nikesh, you talked about Southern Europe being stable in terms of macro. Just curious, since over the last three months if you have seen any changes at all in macro across the U.S. or Europe? And then secondly, Patrick, if you could just talk about how you think about the longer-term margins on the Google segment, that would be helpful. Thanks.","Larry Page","I think Nikesh seems to spend a lot of time in Europe due to the nice weather there.","Nikesh Arora","Nice weather just be more recently, Larry, Q1 was pretty dismal, but \u2013 from a weather perspective. Douglas, thanks for the question. I think, as I said, Southern Europe has been stable, because there has been concern at the macro level in Southern Europe, but our business has been stable. I think the macro conditions have been going on for a while. As far as the U.S. and Europe, I don't think there was anything out of the ordinary that we saw as it relate to our business results, and our teams continue to execute and we continue to engage with advertisers across the board, large and small, and we haven't seen any shift in those trends.","Larry Page","Let me jump on the second part of the question. Look I \u2013 it\u2019s very clear, we care about revenue growth, we care about profitability, and as we\u2019ve said before, right, we\u2019re not in the business of money losing businesses. So regarding margin, for us what really matters is every incremental profit dollar creates shareholder value and we\u2019re focused on growing these profit dollars rather than the specific of the average aggregate margin.","So if you have business for us, that can be a $20 billion business that has a much lower margin than ours, but kind of contribute a couple of billion for the bottom line of the company, what\u2019s not to like, right, especially if it\u2019s rather capital light. And these are the areas that we\u2019re, in addition to our core business, right, exploring and by the way, they have a great symbiotic relationship, right.","When you have devices that are kind of magical and that kind of feed within our core software businesses, there\u2019s this kind of magical relationship as well that kind of continues to enhance our offering. So the real trick there is to keep focused on dollar margin pools, dollar margin in revenue and then not worry too much about where the aggregate shows up because it\u2019s all good for the shareholders.","Nikesh Arora","We shall say, of course, we always look for businesses that are very high margin and high revenues of course too. We\u2019ll take our next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, great. I just had a couple of questions. One, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you guys can do to help prevent Android fragmentation if you could kind of give us your views there. And then on Fiber, I had a follow-up, if maybe you could go beyond the obvious, which is the obvious benefits that people are getting in cities that you\u2019ve rolled out to. If you could maybe help us think about the types of services or offering that you guys see as being possible as this becomes more broadly deployed.","And then lastly, especially given your prior comments on capital light, I was just wondering how we should think about your appetite for CapEx for Fiber. Thank you.","Larry Page","Yeah, thanks, Heather. I guess I can talk a little bit about the Android in the area. And I think that I\u2019ve actually had the pleasure recently of using a bunch of different Android phones from different manufacturers. The experiences are a bit different. The return, the menu back button is on different sides or things like that. There\u2019s differences like that, just somewhat fragmented. But beyond that, we had a pretty great overall experience and there\u2019s a lot of innovation and that the platform is moving really quickly and that\u2019s how we designed it.","So I think that\u2019s \u2013 then the negatives on such fragmentation and the positives on such innovation and flexibility for the different users of the Android ecosystem. So I think actually it\u2019s working pretty well. And we obviously evolve the ecosystem and make sure \u2013 making sure that user got a really great experience and making sure, paying attention to the lab and making sure that works well. But I think we\u2019re actually doing a pretty good job. I think on Fiber, you had some questions on Fiber, I think Patrick can address that.","Patrick Pichette","Yeah, I think that the thesis is not only about the future but it\u2019s really a lot about today. Speed matters today, right? When you wait for three seconds to get to a YouTube video today with your current provider, right? That is a terrible answer. And we think that Fiber and the services we offer in Kansas City today actually can go \u2013 goes a long way to solving a lot of today\u2019s frustrations independent of tomorrows.","In addition to that, our Kansas City offer that we have, right, is already quite differentiated in offering kind of an amazing service, for example, with storage with 2 terabytes of storage available and another in the cloud that really kind of not only is about speed, but it\u2019s about a package that says, you should have abundance. And with abundance, then the third piece which is kind of I think where you were going is the excitement of what the developer community can actually create for a world that is in fact, at blazing speed and with an abundant of storage.","So I think it\u2019s already today answering a big need, it\u2019s already today quite differentiated and it is just laying the path for what should be the next change of the Internet. And I think that you see it in Kansas City with so many developers moving to Kansas City to actually kind of create this coming world, just gives you a glimpse of all the opportunities that are out there. And that\u2019s why we are very excited about it. I think it\u2019s a\u2026.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","And that\u2019s great, thank you. And I was just wondering if you could help us think about the appetite for CapEx?","Larry Page","All right. I mean, we\u2019re going to look at these businesses as we look at any business and make appropriate investments. I think that obviously we know what\u2019s going on with our business and excited, it\u2019s early days, we\u2019re excited about it. And we will continue to evolve that. But as I said earlier too, I mean, it\u2019s difficult if you \u2013 even if you want to spend a lot of money on these kinds of things I think it is quite difficult to do that. So I think that\u2019s also good to keep in mind, some things have a natural rate of growth, but makes sense we\u2019ve done pretty well with that over time.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Nikesh Arora","Let\u2019s go to our next question, Sean, please. We probably have time for one or two.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Stephen Ju \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Thanks very much. So Larry, can you give us some sense of how much incremental engagement you think you can see for Google\u2019s products with new form factors like Glass, and I guess, Watch, as we look out over the next three to five years? And how transportable is Android across these form factors and in terms of getting OEMs and other operators beyond just the smartphones and tablets to adopt that. And, Nikesh, thanks for a number of campaigns on the enhanced campaigns platform. Now wondering like what percent of your advertisers do you think have optimized their sites for content delivery across multiple devices? And when do you think we\u2019ll get greater ability for attribution across mobile and desktop? Thank you.","Larry Page","I think, Steve, there is a lot of questions, I think we got (most of them) [ph], let\u2019s see. So incremental engagement from Google\u2019s products from Glass and so on and watches and things, I think that computers are now pretty big part of people\u2019s lives and I think that\u2019s increasing as it gets more and more useful. And so the amount of time, you only have 24 hours in a day, so there is some limit to that. But I think more importantly, the usefulness of your engagement is going to increase. So right now, while you are just kind of using your computer or your phone or your tablet or whatever and you are kind of bored, maybe you will be less bored and more productive or enjoy what you are doing more and seeing more meaningful engagements. And I think that can result in much better business results and happier people and all that.","I think obviously Glass runs on Android, so it\u2019s been pretty transportable across devices, and I think that will continue. I think, Nikesh, do you want to address the enhanced campaigns a little bit?","Nikesh Arora","Yeah, so thank you Steven for your question. I think what\u2019s important to note is before we launched our enhanced campaigns journey in February, we have been very actively working for the last year plus on our grow more campaign, which is grow more, because clearly, the first part of anybody leveraging the mobile websites just to have one. So we spent a lot of time working with our advertisers and partners out there both to get them online and also to get them mobile. And I think the enhanced campaigns with them was a logical step beyond that. Once you have mobile capability, once you have mobile sites and desktops, we want to make sure that you can get best ROI across those things. I think we\u2019re still working on this; we\u2019re still down the journey. we have a significant number of our early adopters on to enhanced campaigns and as I said, we intend to get them all migrated in the next few months, another next 10 weeks actually. So should be pretty good.","in terms of future, I think we also alluded to the fact that some of the things we\u2019re offering them are things like proximity bidding and offers. so it\u2019s more about first getting them to leverage, their current capabilities, but then also giving more context and more location, which hopefully generates more ROI in the future.","Steve Ju \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Thank you.","Nikesh Arora","We have time for one last question. Sean, who\u2019s getting our last question?","Operator","Our final question comes from Neil Doshi with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Neil Doshi \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Great, thanks for squeezing me in. Larry, could you talk a little bit about online\/mobile to offline attribution and what Google is doing to help kind of bridge that gap and to help our advertisers realize ROI? And then, Nikesh, can you just give us an update as to how far you are through the apps changes policy with your network partners? Is that pretty much all done now or is there more to go there? Thanks.","Larry Page","Thanks, Neil, for your question. I think maybe Nikesh, who is the expert on both these. I think our business has always been about attributing advertising spending and results accurately. And the whole success of our company is really based on that one thing. So we are paying a lot of attention to those kind of questions. So, Nikesh, take it away.","Nikesh Arora","Yeah, Neil, thanks for the question, and thank you, Larry. I guess, what\u2019s the important part is, we have been working, we have hundreds of studies now working with our advertisers to actually look at both the offline and online impacts? And one of the recent things we did is, online to store as we have helped people understand how their online campaigns are driving more and more people into store, which is most of an online activity. We also look at the entire customer journey. We look at across media effectiveness to show how you can run a campaign in the off-line world, how you can add online to it and what kind of attribution that gets you in all off-line media as well as online media.","So we do a bunch of stuff like that. So our research teams are working with external research organizations. So I think we have a reasonably robust practice there working with our advertisers. And in terms of the update, in terms of the ads policy changes, we have implemented all of our ads policies. We obviously have worked with almost all of our network partners. They understand our policies. Many of them have made changes. I think we should be done with most of the transition, but of course, the effect of this policy change will continue to happen throughout the rest of the year.","Larry Page","Okay. Well, thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Yeah. You there?","Larry Page","I'm sorry; I didn\u2019t hear myself, sorry. I was going to ask \u2013 thank everyone for spending so much time with us today and we look forward to hearing from you in the next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Sean, we'll let you close the call.

Please go ahead, Ma\u2019am.","Ellen West","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Google\u2019s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Omid Kordestani. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.","Now let me quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovations, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.","During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.google.com.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thanks. We had strong performance in the second quarter, notwithstanding the continuation of substantial currency headwinds. Key highlights this quarter include ongoing momentum in our core search business particularly mobile, complemented by significant growth in YouTube revenues.","In addition, we are increasingly benefiting from the shift towards programmatic advertising, particularly among brand advertisers. These strong top-line results were complemented by ongoing operating expense discipline in the quarter as reflected in 31% year-over-year growth in GAAP operating income and 16% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating income. I will first go over a summary of the quarter followed by specific financial details and conclude with things for the near-term. Omid will then cover the business and products highlights of the quarter after which we will take your questions.","Beginning with the summary of our financial performance, total revenue was $17.7 billion, up an 11% year-over-year, and up 3% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.6 billion, or $1.1 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 18% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.","On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $4.8 billion and the operating margin was 27%. On a non-GAAP basis, that is excluding stock-based compensation, operating profit was $6 billion and the operating margin was 34%. GAAP net income was $3.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year, and up 12% versus Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $4.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and up 8% versus Q1.","GAAP earnings per diluted share for Class A and B shares were $4.93, and for Class C were $6.43. Higher EPS for Class C reflects the impact of the adjustment payment made in Q2. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $6.99. As detailed in the earnings slides on our IR website, stock-based compensation totaled $1.1 billion, up 29% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially.","Let me now turn to key elements of our financial statements. Starting with our primary revenue sources, Google sites revenue was $12.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year, and up 4% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds. Year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth reflect continued strength in search, particularly mobile search. We continue to close the gap between mobile and desktop search monetization.","Specifically on mobile, we\u2019re pleased with our ongoing progress resulting from our focus on user experience, ads quality and online to offline commerce initiatives. The combination of these efforts improves the effectiveness and value of mobile for users and marketers alike. Desktop search delivered solid revenue growth again this quarter. YouTube again delivered substantial growth in user engagement globally, particularly on mobile, which translated into strong adoption of our TrueView ad format.","Growth in watch time on YouTube has accelerated and is now up over 60% year-over-year, the fastest growth rate we\u2019ve seen in two years. Mobile watch time has more than doubled from a year ago. Network revenue was $3.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year and up 1% sequentially, continuing to reflect the diversion performance of programatic on the one hand and our legacy network businesses on the other.","Our programatic business including AdExchange and DoubleClick Bid Manager continue to deliver strong year-over-year and sequential performance then more than offset lower results in AdSense for Search. We remain committed to policy changes that improve the user experience notwithstanding the fact that these policies have a negative impact on AdSense for Search revenue. Other revenue was $1.7 billion, up 17% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also had an impact on other revenue. Year-over-year and sequential movements were driven by substantial growth in Play offset by decline in the hardware sales.","Next revenues by geography. U.S. revenue was up 16% year-over-year to $8 billion and up 4% versus Q1. UK revenue was up 4% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and flat sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the U.K. grew 11% year-over-year and was flat quarter-over-quarter, rest of world revenue was up 8% versus last year to $8 billion and up 2% versus Q1. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 22% year-over-year, and up 4% sequentially highlighting both the strength of our global business as well as the impact of FX.","Finally revenue monetization; as a reminder, these metrics similarly reflect currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 18% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 11% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. In terms of the drivers within Google sites paid clicks were up 30% year-over-year, and up 10% sequentially in particular reflecting growth in YouTube TrueView as well as in mobile.","Google sites CPCs were down 16% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. Mobile CPCs continue to strengthen and the gap to desktop continues to grow as I previously noted. The decline in CPCs reflects the impact of YouTube TrueView, which is a growing percentage of overall sites clicks mix and where CPCs remain lower than on our other platforms.","Network paid clicks were down 9% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially reflecting the impact of our ongoing policy changes designed to reduce the lower quality inventory on AdSense for Search consistent with our focus on improving user experience. Network CPCs were down 3% both year-over-year and sequentially.","Let me turn now to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.4 billion, or 21% of total advertising revenue, which was down slightly sequentially. Trends within sites and network TAC remains flat, due to mix shifts in partners, products and devices. As a reminder, the sites TAC line includes the TAC that we pay to search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search.","Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3 billion in Q2, up 12% year-over-year, and up 7% versus Q1. Year-on-year and sequential growth were driven by costs associated with operating our data centers including deprecation as well as content acquisition cost primarily for YouTube and Play. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.4 billion, or 30% of revenue, up 11% year-over-year and down 1% versus Q1.","The increase in operating expense versus 2Q 2014 primarily reflects R&D expense attributable to increased hiring of engineers and product managers. Headcount increased 18% versus last year and 3% versus 1Q 2015 with total headcount at quarter-end of approximately 57,100. The deceleration in year-over-year growth and decline in quarter-over-quarter operating expenses reflects in part discipline in expense management and in part lower legal expenses than in comparable periods; a breakout of individual operating expense lines is available on our earnings slides.","Other income and expense was $131 million with interest income offset by higher expenses from our FX hedging program. The effective tax rate was 21% for the second quarter. As noted in our press release, in Q2, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities. We revised our income tax expense for the relevant periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015 in the cumulative amount of $711 million. The income tax adjustments were not material to the effected periods; more detail is available on our earnings slides.","Turning now to CapEx and cash. CapEx for the quarter was $2.5 billion, primarily for production equipment and data center construction. CapEx spend was lower versus last year and last quarter reflecting a bit of a digestion period after an extended period of investments in both data centers and the requisite machine deployment. We continue to view our computing infrastructure as one of our most strategic assets. Operating cash flow was $7 billion with free cash flow of $4.5 billion resulting in a cash balance of approximately $70 billion at the end of the quarter of which approximately $40 billion or 58% is held overseas.","Let me close with five topics of focus for the near-term, first on revenue growth and drivers. Our strong revenue growth in the second quarter, notwithstanding the adverse effects of the strong U.S. dollar evidences the health of our core search business most notably mobile, complemented by growth in YouTube and programmatic advertising. Our earlier stage products such as Fiber, Google Life Sciences, and Nest service longer-term sources of revenue. Regarding these areas, we are focused on tight governance to ensure that the resourcing for them is appropriate and we\u2019ll talk more about these products in greater detail as I get settled in.","Second, the sequential deceleration in expense growth achieved in the second quarter reflects in part the benefit of expense discipline discussed in prior calls. A key focus is on the levers within our control to manage the pace of expenses while still ensuring and supporting our growth. We will do this while we continue to invest in engineering talent to keep us preeminent in innovation globally.","Third, the pace of growth in capital expenditures over the last several years has been significant. Although the vast majority of CapEx to date have been to support our core business, growing requirements for newer products underscore the increasing importance of optimization across the many opportunities ahead of us. Fourth, our cash balance grew again this quarter, which of course gives us more strategic flexibility. We remain focused on judiciously capitalizing on the strategic opportunities that we have, which are many. And the key issue is how we prioritize our capital allocation, given the breadth of opportunities.","Finally, as Larry has frequently noted, Google\u2019s goal is to develop great new services that significantly improves the lives of as many people as possible. Solving problems for users at scale ultimately results in monetization opportunities. How we prioritize and focus on these opportunities remains paramount, both for our employees, who remain inspired by the opportunity to work on the most cutting edge developments with maximum global impact and for our shareholders. I look forward to working with you.","I will now turn the call over to Omid, who will cover the business details of the quarter.","Omid Kordestani","Thanks Ruth. It\u2019s great to be here to talk with everyone again. Since we last spoke, Google has been very busy hosting our customers and developers from across the globe at events ranging from I\/O to the DoubleClick Leadership Summit to BrandCast. We\u2019re seeing great momentum and results across the company.","As you all saw at IO, we continue to invest in innovation across our core products. To call out just one, the new Photos app is a great example of how we\u2019re combining the power of a machine learning, search and beautiful design, something that Google is proud to bring together in such a great package for our users. Our investments in machine learning have applications across the company and have real potential to improve our business. For instance, machine learning helps us to improve and adds visual design to maximize its performance. There\u2019s enormous opportunity here.","I want to quickly share a few highlights of the past quarter and then spend more time talking about our progress in what continues to be our two biggest focus areas and growth drivers: mobile and video. First, our core products continue to do well and users love them. In fact, Google Search, YouTube, Android, Chrome and Google Maps, each have over one billion users. We also continue to see great partner momentum across the Android platform. The Android phone ecosystem started with one device, one carrier and one OEM, the T-Mobile G1 in 2008 and has grown now to over 400 OEMs and over 500 carriers, who make over 4,000 distinct devices. This is a testament to our great progress on both the tech and partnering fronts.","Google Play continues to grow at an impressive clip. Google Play games has added more than 180 million new users in the past six months and continues to be one of the fastest growing mobile gaming platforms in history. In addition, we\u2019re seeing strong momentum around Google Cloud platform, with a range of great new features, new major customer announcements like HTC and JDA software and our collaboration with Broad Institute.","And on the advertising side as a trend towards programatic ad buying continues, we\u2019re helping clients succeed in a multi-screen world with our DoubleClick platform. We recently expanded cross device measurement to all of our DoubleClick advertiser products, so marketers can measure these conversions for all of their campaigns. And to help publishers, we\u2019ve recently announced full DoubleClick support for native ad formats.","Now I\u2019ll spend a few minutes diving more into the big areas of opportunity for us, the shift to mobile and the continued growth of online video. I talked last quarter about the shift we see in consumer behavior as people turned to their phones throughout the day to decide what to buy or do. Google\u2019s role has always been to meet people\u2019s needs in the exact moment they are looking and those moments are increasingly happening on mobile devices.","More Google searches now take place on mobile devices than on computers in ten countries, including the U.S. and Japan, two of our largest markets. And we know that when people search on their mobile phones, they\u2019re looking for immediacy and action. In fact, 30% of mobile queries are related to location and our efforts around local search are helping consumers to find relevant information fast.","We\u2019re investing in creating great mobile experiences for people across Google products. As Sundar and his teams showed at I\/O this year, there is a lot to be excited about from now on Tab to Android Pay and much more. As I mentioned, one of my favorites is the new photos app, where you can keep and organize all of your memories and easily share and save what matters to you. If you\u2019re like me and have an overwhelming number of photos on your phone, the photos app makes taking, organizing and finding pictures much more manageable and enjoyable and it\u2019s getting better every day.","In addition, our teams have made great strides to help users find what they need within third-party apps through indexing. We now have 50 billion links within apps index and 25% of signed in Google searches on Android now return deep links, taking users right to content within an app or to a link so they can install it. We also recently started showing such links in search results on iOS, developers like [indiscernible] are really seeing a boost in traffic as a result of deep linking. We also added now cards for more than 100 apps like OpenTable and Spotify and we have extended Google Voice actions to third party developers, so we can say things like, okay Google listen to MPR.","Alongside our efforts to make mobile better for users, we\u2019re continuing to help marketers succeed in today\u2019s mobile world. For instance at I\/O we recently announced universal app campaigns, which will let developers easily reach users across Google search, the add mob network, mobile sites, YouTube and Google Play. Marketers just tell us what their ad will say, the audience they want to reach, and how much they want to spend and our ad systems will do the rest to help them maximize performance.","We introduced new mobile ad formats like automobile ads, which take you directly to a carousel of vehicle images important details like estimated MPG, and links to nearby dealer listings. And just yesterday, we announced purchases on Google, which makes it easier for people searching on Google to buy things right from their mobile phones.","I want to turn now to YouTube, which is showing strong momentum with users and advertisers as we reinvent the television experience for the digital age. On mobile alone, YouTube reaches more 18 to 49 year old in the U.S. than any U.S. cable network. And the number of users coming to YouTube, who start at the Youtube homepage similar to the way they might turn on their TV is up over three times year-on-year plus once users are in YouTube, they are spending more time per session watching videos, on mobile the average viewing session is now more than 40 minutes up more than 50% year-over-year.","As consumers continue to shift their content consumption from television to digital, brand dollars are flowing \u2013 I am sorry following, which we\u2019re seeing an upfront buying through our Google preferred model. Compared to the same period after BrandCast as last year, Google preferred commitments in the U.S. were three times higher. We\u2019re also seeing great adoption of our video ad formats like TrueView and continue to help marketers engage and connect the consumers in new ways. The number of advertisers running video ad on YouTube is up more than 40% year-over-year and for our top 100 advertisers, the average spend per advertiser is up over 60% year-over-year. We recently introduced a new feature for TrueView that allows brands to automatically insert product information, images and pricing into their video ads.","And as advertising increasingly shifts towards programatic buying brands can now easily buy TrueView ads programatically through DoubleClick Bid Manager. All this is helping our content creators build the next generation of media companies doing what they love making great videos. The number of channels earning six figures per year on YouTube is up 50% year-over-year.","One of the key reasons for this success is our Content ID initiative which is used by more than 8,000 partners who have claimed over 400 million videos helping them control their content on YouTube and make money on videos containing copyrighted material. So as you can see it\u2019s been a very busy and successful quarter, we are super focus on our key goals of delivering amazing mobile and video experiences and there is lot more coming in the next few months including the Android M release, now on tap Android Pay, and YouTube gaming.","Thank you to all the Googlers around the world for their great work everyday. And now back to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you. In my comments, I meant to note that the gap between mobile and desktop continues to [Technical Difficulty]. And with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Ellen.","Ellen West","Great, thank you [Technical Difficulty]","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Unidentified Analyst","Really had build up headcount and data center capabilities. Just where are you on capacity and really what was the purpose of this big build up, what kind of capabilities does that give Google today? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you for that question. First I do want to clarify one thing in my comments on CPCs, I meant to note that the gap between mobile and desktop continues to narrow obviously an important trend wanted to clarify that. So look in terms of headcount in data center capabilities and what that does for us. As I said in our view, our infrastructure is one of the most strategic assets that we have and as we talk about what happened in the second quarter it reflects the fact that there can be some variability in the cadence of spend and so while overall capital intensity was lower in Q2 than in prior year and prior quarter, that\u2019s a more an issue of how spend is faced during the year but the main point as we do computing capacity as a strategic asset it provides us with the flexibility necessary for growth.","And as I try to convey as well obviously it\u2019s a priority to achieve efficiencies were possible and particular given some of the newer opportunities that we have. And so we are just beginning the 2016 budgeting process quarter that is prioritization but it really has been about strategic flexibility and the underlying strength of all that we do.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Great. Operator, we\u2019ll go to our next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Duetsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ross Sandler","Great, I just had two questions. Omid, the U.S. reaccelerated looks like from 12% to 16% in the quarter, can you just give us a little color of what drove that was it more a function of core search and mobile picking up or \u2013 for YouTube? And then, Ruth did you mentioned in you prepared remarks that a lot of the expense deceleration was put in place before you got to Google. So now that you\u2019ve been in the seat for a couple of months, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing and what potentially you could do in addition to what was in place in 2015 before you got there? Thank you.","Omid Kordestani","Thank you, Ross. Our performance really reflects the fact that we have a diverse set of products that are doing well. We have strength in core search obviously and in particularly mobile, YouTube and programmatic we\u2019re seeing a lot of strength. We saw a nice pick up in a number of verticals in Q2 coming off weather-related weakness in Q1. And this quarter we\u2019re seeing retail and travel being stronger verticals in search. As to the second part of the question, I have Ruth to address that.","Ruth Porat","And so with respect to expense management obviously a lot has been done on expense discipline has been discussed on calls for a number of quarters in. And I think it\u2019s fair to say proper resource allocation stretches across OpEx and CapEx and it\u2019s about prioritizing our investments and ensuring that we\u2019re being efficient and effective with our spend. To be clear, the priority is revenue growth and we have a breadth of opportunity, but pursuing revenue growth is obviously not inconsistent with expense management.","And so as I noted we\u2019re just starting the 2016 budgeting process, in my experience the best way to slow the rate of growth in expenses is to work closely with business leaders really anchored in data, so together we can identify ways to prioritize resources and really continue to extend the discipline that we\u2019ve talked about. And given my early conversations with our business leaders, I look forward to this exercise over the next couple of months and we\u2019re very engaged with it. Great, operator we\u2019ll take our next question.","Ross Sandler","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Carlos Kirjner","Thank you. I have two questions. Ruth can you help us understand Google\u2019s position vis-\u00e0-vis debt. It\u2019s probably not controversial that your debt level is much below your capacity. Are there any reasons why Google would not want to raise debt, if you had to finance a large acquisition and if yes, could you help us understand what these reasons are? And secondly, how do we reconcile the strength in mobile search with the fact that distribution pack grew only 6% year-on-year? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","So starting with your question about cash which \u2013 and whether we would issue debt, I think, the way I look at that is you\u2019re talking about overall efficiency of balance sheet and how are we using the balance sheet and I\u2019ve slightly broadened the question more than what you did, but at the end of the day, our focus \u2013 my focus is maximizing shareholder value over the medium to long-term and that is about how effectively are we using our balance sheet where we investing and that could theoretically be a part of that. But if you step back as I\u2019ve looked at it and the key issue is what do we need for working capital?","What do we need for CapEx? What do we need for M&A? What do we need potentially for capital return? How does one think about financing the various opportunities that we have and I would say it\u2019s early days, it would be premature to be more specific than that. But given this profitability of our business we have many opportunities given the growing mix of our business, we have opportunities, I would say allocation decisions are mutually exclusive, allocation can obviously change as opportunities evolve. But as we look at it, we have a breadth of opportunities, again I think it\u2019s premature to be more specific on that at this point.","Carlos Kirjner","How about the distribution TAC on growing 6% given the strength of mobile?","Ruth Porat","So as it relates to distribution TAC, sites TAC dollars are up modestly year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and that\u2019s what I would really focus you on its the dollar change and obviously you know the 12%, but that\u2019s a good thing, because with those TAC dollars comes revenue. As a remainder TAC includes payments made to search distribution partners is distinct from YouTube and Play content acquisition costs, which are in other cost of revenue. So looking at this on a percentage of revenue basis, what you are seeing is the impact of YouTube revenue growth, sites revenue was up. But the associated content acquisition costs are reflected in higher other cost of revenue not in sites TAC.","Carlos Kirjner","Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Stephen Ju","Okay, thanks. So, Omid big picture in the outperformance of programatic in YouTube is interesting as it seems to beg the next question as you \u2013 your current list of advertising products now seems to touch all parts of the consumer purchasing funnel. So I'm wondering where you are in uniting all of the different pieces so that you can walk into a large advertiser and lay out the data, so that the 15 second TrueView spot that they ran turn into a list in the sales of X percent. Okay, thanks.","Omid Kordestani","Sure. It\u2019s a good question and in fact that\u2019s one of the areas that I really focused on after I came back and, it is a suite of products that\u2019s we are very proud of and working well for advertisers and what we like to say internally, as we like to have one Google represented to the customers so that in these conversations with them we really understand their objectives and really in the classic sense of the funnel you know we can start from the brand journey from the beginning to purchase across, search display video and then as you know we recently brought cross-device measurement to DoubleClick.","So, the focus is really on all aspect of this journey online to store we\u2019re showing how mobile ads are driving actual store visits for advertisers and your Brand Lift studies we\u2019re showing brands in real-time how their ads are performing, we done over 10,000 Brand Lift studies on YouTube campaigns alone. So its we really just excited about having this full suite now and being able to have the full coverage of this customer acquisition journey from branding all the way to conclusion of a transaction.","Stephen Ju","Thank you.","Omid Kordestani","Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Mark Mahaney","Great, thanks. Omid, you gave a lot of great data points on the growth in YouTube and stuff that\u2019s accelerated could you spend little bit more time on the why has YouTube seen this kind of reacceleration resurgence in growth. Do you think its part of a broader industry trend, the weakness in the upfront, offline is now coming online or is what else specifically, what specifically is YouTube doing to kind of better capture those dollars and then Ruth I know somebody ask you about that, logical follow-on question is the cash returns and share repurchases and dividends and just I know its early days but your thoughts on and your collective thoughts, Google how you think about that over the next few years when if ever it make logical sense to do that? Thank you.","Omid Kordestani","I\u2019ll start and hand it to Ruth. So its \u2013 I think it\u2019s really combination of all of the strength of YouTube coming together it starts with having over a billion users nearly almost one-third of all people on the internet everyday watching hundreds of millions of hours on the services and that creates billions of views and as Ruth mentioned the growth in watch time on YouTube accelerated in this now up over 60% year-over-year the fastest we\u2019ve seen in couple of years.","And I think we are doing it also much better job with our products in our sales force to not only deliver for the creators on YouTube and do a better job of helping them monetize their contents and at the same time, then highlighting that success to programs like Brandcast where advertisers, agencies see that dynamic audience and service and then with the advertising products be able to then show them the real benefits of advertising and the ways that they can measure its effectiveness. So it\u2019s really all the pieces coming together for us and obviously we have a lot of work to do and we see still a lot of opportunity to enhance the service. So, I think you will see a lot of innovation coming from us both on the service front as well as on the advertising products.","Ruth Porat","Hey, Mark. As you noted, it is early days but the way I view any assessment of a return on capital for my prior answer regarding balance sheet efficiency is really in the context of maximizing stakeholder value over the medium to long-term.","And with return of capital it gets into the context of, how do you prioritize and allocate cash after an appropriate reserve for working capital amongst the CapEx, M&A and then potentially that capital return. And as I said, the allocation decisions are mutually exclusive, the profitability of our business gives us many opportunities, but the main point is to date the weakest return on investment here has been in our core search business including mobile search as a result of both smart M&A and CapEx. Here M&A, we built a lot of the growth engines today, YouTube and DoubleClick are great examples. Again this underscores the power of smart targeted acquisitions.","We also have a strong track record of investment in new products as you know well and the infrastructure to support explosive growth, our tech infrastructure I've already commented on is really unparalleled and we do view it as a great strategic asset and we\u2019ve invested in it substantially over many years. So trying to gauge whether or how capital returns fits in, it\u2019s premature to do that and it\u2019s really looking across these various potential uses.","Mark Mahaney","Thank you, Ruth. Thank you, Omid.","Ruth Porat","Thanks Mark.","Omid Kordestani","Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Okay, operator, we will take our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the question. Omid, you mentioned retail travel is through the stronger verticals advertising front and in the recent past, you guys have made a number of announcements around products that align your interest or more closely with suppliers, people who try closing the economic loop and you might be even moving down the funnel. How do you think about the opportunities for Google to sort of move down respective finals and industries where you do you already have a fair bit of expertise? Thanks.","Omid Kordestani","Sure. Thanks, Eric for the question. We\u2019re really focused on connecting retailers to consumers across screens and also reducing this friction involved in finding and purchasing products. All including local products and stores. So that entire journey and all the aspects of commerce is a great area of focus for us. And as users begin to \u2013 as they search, start their searches on mobile phones, we are continuously trying to find ways to improve their mobile shopping experience.","And as shopping experiences on these smart phones become easier and we focus on improving mobile conversion for advertisers. We are seeing great benefits from that, we just announced purchases on Google, for example, the smartphone only feature of the product listing ads an example. And again all of these are really for us the building blocks to help in reduction of that friction and bring the expertise we have and that understanding the immediacy, the local nature of these searches and understanding conversion and how to kind of put it all together for users, and for advertisers and machines.","Ruth Porat","Okay, operator we\u2019ll take our next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead.","Douglas Anmuth","Great thanks. Just to follow-up a little bit on the last one, Omid can you talk more specifically about the cross-platform efforts and estimated conversions in particular and whether you\u2019re seeing that prove more of the value across the platform.","And then secondly, you commented several times that the gap is tightening on pricing between mobile and desktop, can you quantify that by any chance and can you just talk about what you think drives that to tighten further, go forward? Thanks.","Omid Kordestani","Sure, I\u2019ll have Ruth take that second part. On the first part on this online to offline conversion efforts, we obviously know that mobile activities are influencing offline behavior and we\u2019re very busy investing in new dynamic products that help bring mobile users to stores. We\u2019re seeing strong results from clients using our tools to bridge this digital and physical world. And great adoption of local inventory ads, which help advertisers promote their store items to nearby shoppers. So again that\u2019s how the whole cycle of usage of smartphones and the immediacy come together.","And then we\u2019ve created way for advertisers to measure the impact of these ads on store visits. So just to give you a couple of examples, Target, one of our advertisers found that mobile search ads greatly influence in-store store sales and using our store visit data they found that a third of their paid search ads resulted in a user visiting a target store during 2014 holiday season. So we love to continue working with them and other advertisers to show the results and then build on that.","Florida department store working with us found that 63% of their mobile influenced sales take place off-line. And so more and more we\u2019re doing these studies, we\u2019re putting the tools together for these advertisers and our partners, the merchants and finding ways for them to really quantify these benefits and just scale these programs for everyone.","Ruth Porat","And then as it relates to the second part of your question there are really two good stories here given the importance of search. Mobile CPCs up and desktop CPCs not declining so the gap is narrowing. On the mobile side as Larry said before with respect to desktop it took time to fully develop the pricing model and we remain focused on building the mobile ecosystem to have the right ad formats and measurement to take advantage of all the platform ads to offer features like estimated store visits, app install, the rengagement ads, cross device conversions are all part of this strategy.","And then on desktop, the business continues to grow. It remains a good contributor to overall results as we announced that the AdWords performance Summit in May ongoing developments in rich and useful ads that work across all screams including desktop, enable us to deliver the right answers for our users in the right moment in other words, ads format that accelerate time to conversion on both mobile and desktop and that\u2019s what\u2019s really narrowing this gap here.","Douglas Anmuth","Great, thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente","Hi, thanks a lot for taking my question. Ruth given your background, I just want to ask if you thought the regulatory backdrop for Google is in anyway analogous to the financial services industry and sort of what is your outlook for a larger player like Google in an environment of increasing regulatory pressure, particularly outside the U.S. and of course specifically for Google with the EC demanding changes to the search results, just wondering should we be concerned that that these regulatory pressures can ultimately have an impact on your business. Thanks.","Ruth Porat","Let\u2019s see, the industries are different, but as it comes to our business Google operates in a very competitive environment, there are many windows on to the web, choice, competition, investment are all going up, not down and we do look forward to continuing to work constructively with the EC to address any concerns they may have and regulators generally.","Anthony DiClemente","Okay, thank you very much.","Ruth Porat","Thank you. Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Brian Nowak","I have two. The first one, Ruth, is going back to your comments on some of the earlier stage projects fiber life science that [indiscernible] focused on tight governance. Is there anyway you can kind of help us to think about OpEx or CapEx related to those projects at this point and how we should think about maintenance versus investment in OpEx and CapEx going forward? And then the second one just going back to the accelerating U.S. revenue growth, it sounds like mobile and YouTube are both doing pretty well. Can you just help us understand or are you seeing both accelerate \u2013 is U.S. search accelerating at this point or is it more so being driven by YouTube? Thanks.","Ruth Porat","Sure, so let me take your first question \u2013 first part of your question first. In terms of overall kind of the framework for thinking about our businesses broadly, I think a valuable framework to use is one that Eric and Larry have referred to for many years, namely the 70\/20\/10, 70% resources on the core 20% on adjacent areas, one point that included Chrome and Android and they are now in the core but it would include things like cloud and then 10% in additional new exciting opportunities in really sizable markets like Viber or what we\u2019re doing with Google Life Sciences.","And so in discussing this with Larry its clearest objective has been to instill within the culture this mission to drive not just important innovation associated with our core business but also to look for as he call them revolutionary ideas, big solutions that can meaningfully contribute both to making peoples life better into the next big revenue and earnings growth opportunity for Google.","And my take is that Larry gives the 70\/20\/10 as an instructive framework he is also noted how hard is it to reach that 10% on these big new revolutionary ideas, because it\u2019s tough to get people to tackle big difficult new problems and start pursuing incremental change. So human nature sort of provides a limit on how big that final bucket would be the new opportunities and I think the other point to consider is the Google\u2019s core business continues to deliver strong growth. So to achieve 10% in the big new areas means continually trying to reach 10% of an even larger number.","And the framework keeps us focused on big ambitions across the company but given the success of the core business I think its fair to say the 10% is a stretch goal for now and it\u2019s a way to think about resources which hopefully helps you fill in a bit there. And then the second part of your question if you could repeat that.","Brian Nowak","Yes. We just going back to the accelerating overall U.S. revenue. Just curious about a little more color on the drivers there were, its sounds like both YouTube and mobile search are doing pretty well. Is it safe to say that U.S. search and YouTube are both accelerating or you seeing YouTube driver is proportionate how should we think about the drivers of the U.S. revenue acceleration?","Ruth Porat","Well, you\u2019ve covered a lot of it, the U.S. growth really reflects the fact we have diverse set of products that are doing well, we had strengthen core search particularly mobile, we had strengthen YouTube and programatic as Omid talked about. So it\u2019s really the breadth across a number of different products that deliver the results that you are talking about, that we are talking about here today.","Brian Nowak","Thanks.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Ellen West","Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you so much. I just had two quick questions. I was just wondering you talked a lot about desktop and mobile CPCs. I was wondering if you could share with us if the narrowing of the gap between the two was actually starting to accelerate. And then the other thing I wanted to ask is just thinking about the CapEx spending made that companies go through and clearly Google been on one on an accelerated spending way for the last few years, should we then suggest \u2013 get from your comments are you were in a digestion period that the digestion period could also be a multi-year trend as well, if there is any thoughts you could share there. Thank you.","Ruth Porat","You know I think with respect to the first part of your question, we thought it was important to be clear that this gap is narrowing and to give you a sense of some of the mix issues within CPCs. So mobile, CPCs strengthening desktop not declining, YouTube remains lower, but we\u2019re seeing real strong growth in TrueView. And so it\u2019s just really to try in dimension that if you think about what\u2019s going on with the mix change.","And then as it relates to expenses, what I was trying to convey there is that we \u2013 in the second quarter had a bit of a digestion period here on the back of the substantial investment spend that we\u2019ve had and I would say in terms of \u2013 if you kind of think about the second quarter in that context, there can be some variability in the cadences spend.","And so a part of it as we\u2019re talking about the CapEx here is how spend has phased during the year, I wouldn\u2019t suggest that we\u2019re talking about \u2013 as the way you frame the question, this multi-period given the sheer scope of opportunities that we have. So as I said again with the front-ends with respect to both CapEx and OpEx, we\u2019re just beginning the 2016 budgeting process. We\u2019re very focused on prioritization, but I was trying to give you some context for what was going on in the second quarter.","And then as it relates to OpEx in terms of the back half of the year, there are seasonal fluctuations that do typically impact operating expense as well. For example, headcount usually picks up in the third quarter with new grad hire starting and our marketing expense also tends to be weighted towards the second half of the year. So again I was trying to give you a sense of what\u2019s the cadence as you\u2019re thinking about the year.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question please, operator.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Peck from Suntrust. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Robert Peck","I had two questions if you don\u2019t mind. The first is around possibility of working more directly with Yahoo on search and search results. Could you tell us about any progress there, work you\u2019ve done there? And then number two, Ruth, could you talk about the future possibly breaking out more information around your businesses to a point where maybe we\u2019d breakout YouTube or DoubleClick or some of these other businesses that could give investors a little more clarity on the size and growth of them? Thank you.","Omid Kordestani","I\u2019ll take the first part. So Yahoo is currently testing search results and adds some number of partners including Google as one of their options. And they have options to use search services and search ads across your properties and you may see our ads. And so it\u2019s a standard agreement and many other publishers use our Web search and AdSense for search. We look forward to working with them and hopefully having a good performance for them.","Ruth Porat","And then in terms of the second part of your question, I think, it\u2019s important to help our stakeholders understand how we think about key drivers of the business and how we manage the business, providing what I call a framework for understanding the momentum in the business, our investment choices, our capital allocation decision making. I\u2019m committed to being direct with you. I won\u2019t give you competitively sensitive information, but my goal is to help you understand the business as well as possible.","And in my view it\u2019s our obligation to pursue activities that maximize value over the long-term and doing it in a disciplined fashion. And the point I'm really trying to drive here is I aim to create a framework that helps you understand where we\u2019re going. So you\u2019re asking what we think about breaking out any particular business, I\u2019m trying to understand how best to provide more insight into the drivers of the business and beyond what is currently provided and it\u2019s really too early to be more specific than that.","Robert Peck","Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Operator, we\u2019ll take our last question please.","Operator","And our last question comes from Paul Vogel from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Paul Vogel","Great, thank you. Two questions on YouTube. One, there\u2019s been a lot of speculation in the past about the profitability of YouTube. So I\u2019m just sort of curious how you think about the revenue growth versus kind of the forward spend on forward demand and if YouTube in a position where it's starting to see leverage on the upside with the strong revenue growth. And then on the revenue side, in particular where you talk about how YouTube has been sort of \u2013 it\u2019s one of the things that's drag the optics of CPC down. When mobile was doing that I think the company believe that over time mobile would be additive and we\u2019re starting to see, but it took some time. How do you think about YouTube in the context of is there a point in time you think YouTube will actually be additive to sort of the optics of CPC versus where it is right now? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","So I think there was three parts to that question. In terms of the revenue growth in YouTube, Omid hit a number of them, but we continue to have strong growth there and it really does reflect as he said the sheer volume of users we have over a billion users. And those users are spending more time watching and watch time growth continues to accelerate now up over 60% year-over-year, the fastest rate we\u2019ve seen in two years and we do view watch time as most valuable measure of engagement. And it does reflect the ongoing improvement in ads quality with more users also choosing to watch more TrueView ads not only do we have a huge user base that\u2019s highly engaged, but data points like the fact there are more 18 to 49 year olds on mobile YouTubes and watching cable TV today really underscores the opportunity here. And our focus is the opportunity to get larger budgets, move to YouTube.","And then in terms of the profitability question, as you know we don\u2019t breakout profit by product and we view our technical infrastructure as a core strategic asset that supports products across the company, I have already said that on this call that is an important point. It is fair to say that much of the network expenses that supporting YouTube, it\u2019s a large user of capacity and our ability to serve high quality HD video on demand around the world is unparalleled. From the users\u2019 perspective, YouTube is a great example of a multi-device platform with high usage on both desktop and mobile. We have one ad team that works across our various products and when we work with the largest ad partners globally, we\u2019re selling a total package.","Omid\u2019s comment on some of that, not surprisingly if you take our top advertisers, they all advertise across all our products, not necessarily the same rate, but we have a single team working with them to close the differential. We do view that as a great opportunity. And the goal, to give just a bit more color on how some of our assets and technical infrastructure and ad sales team benefit a number of our different products across the company. And then I think you slipped a third part in there on the status of \u2013 that kind of the CPC trends and YouTube TrueView pricing, so I will disclose out on that.","CPC pricing on YouTube for TrueView ads, ads that users choose not to skip is lower than on CPC pricing on desktop and mobile, but YouTube TrueView ads represented a larger percentage of our overall clicks, so had a greater impact on CPCs. And this is really about the tremendous growth in YouTube views. And not \u2013 you know again, when we see the real uptake here and the extent to which users are choosing to watch more ads given our effort around ad relevance and quality, advertisers want to reach these audiences. And our focus is on the opportunity to get larger budgets move to YouTube.","Paul Vogel","Okay, thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you. Okay, and with that, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.","Operator","Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"1171":["Google Inc.

This call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Willa Chalmers, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Willa Chalmers","Great, thank you, Jennifer. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to today's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 earnings conference call. With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.","Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So, please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. You can also visit our Google Plus Investor Relations page for the latest company news and updates. So, please check it out. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website later today.","So, let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.","These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are also expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.","We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.","With that, I will turn the call over to Larry.","Larry Page","Happy New Year everyone and welcome to our earnings call. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. We ended 2012 with a strong quarter. Revenue was up 36% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter and we hit $50 billion in revenue for the first time last year, not a bad achievement in just a decade-and-a-half.","We have talked a lot about excellence and velocity over the last year. While many claim it's my nature never to be satisfied, we've actually made real progress creating more beautiful and more intuitive products.","Take Search. The perfect search engine would understand exactly what you mean and give you exactly what you want. Our Knowledge Graph brings that much closer.","Search for Nikola Tesla and you will get information about this great inventor that is beautifully displayed right from the results page. His basic bio, books he wrote, his photo, no extra work needed, and we even recommend information about other inventors such as Edison and Marconi that you can easily browse through. Again, right from the results page.","And last quarter, we launched the Knowledge Graph in seven new languages, including Spanish, Japanese and Russian. This is hard work. It's about way more than translating the words on the page. Google has to understand millions of different entities as well as their meaning and context.","I'm also excited about the progress we\u2019ve made with Voice Search.  You're in your car, sadly it's still a car you have to drive and it\u2019s not electric and you're running out of gas. Just pick up your phone and ask Google for directions to the nearest gas station and you'll be on your way immediately. It's a great example of how we can take the hassle right out of your life.","Our long-term investments in Google Maps have really paid off. The team has worked tremendously hard to create the most accurate and comprehensive maps in the world. Driving country-by-country may have seemed crazy a few years back. Today, it\u2019s totally obvious, because location is core to your search experience. And with Google Maps for iOS, we have reinvigorated our product. It's more intuitive and beautiful, and users love it. Google Maps for iOS was downloaded over 10 million times in the first 48 hours.","In fact, six Google apps were included in Apple's App Store Best Free Apps of 2012, including YouTube, Chrome, Google Search and Gmail.","I\u2019ve always believed that computers should do the hard work, so you can get on with the things that matter in life living, learning and loving. So it\u2019s exciting to see our progress with Google Now. Launched earlier in the year, it gives you information before you even have to ask. We\u2019ll now proactively provide your flight times, or your boarding pass, or directions to your next appointment. We'll even suggest interesting places to visit nearby.","As we discussed on the last earnings call, we now live in a multi-screen world. People carry a supercomputer in their pocket all the time. In fact, we feel naked without our smartphone and many users have more than one device, a laptop, a phone, and a tablet. We are living in unchartered territory. It's a new kind of computing environment. Everyone is really excited about the technology and are spending a lot of money on devices driving faster adoption than we have ever seen before.","It's been a long time in computing since we had this rate of change. It probably hasn\u2019t happened since the birth of personal computing. It's why we have put so much focus on devices. They have been one of our biggest bets in the last few years, along with software to go with these devices, Chrome and Android.","Our goal here is to push the user experience forward, so you get the best of Google in one easy to use package. The Samsung Chromebook, which we launched in October at an amazing price of $249 was a holiday highlight. I love mine. It is super easy to use and almost maintains itself. Open a chrome tab on your phone and everything syncs on your laptop with no extra effort required. We also launched two new Nexus devices to rave reviews, Nexus 4 and Nexus 10.","In six months after we first unveiled it, the Nexus 7 continues to define the 7 inch tablet category making many best of 2012 and holiday gift lists. Clearly there is work to be done in managing our supply better, as well as building a great customer experience and that is a priority for the teams. But considering all the excitement over the holidays for our devices, it is clear there is tremendous opportunity in delivering great value with amazing and simple user experience.","Google Play, another big bet is on fire. The growth is tremendous. This quarter we signed deals with Time as well as Warner Music Group. So we now provide contents from all the top Hollywood film studios, music labels and magazine publishers. We have not even reached Google Play's first anniversary.","Many of you have questions about Motorola, and Patrick will go into details of our accounting for the business so that you can do your models right. I am excited about the business. In today's multi-screen world the opportunities are endless. Think about your devices, battery life is a huge issue. You shouldn\u2019t have to worry about constantly recharging your phone. When you drop your phone, it shouldn\u2019t go splat. Everything should be ton faster and easier.","There is real potential to invent new and better experiences. Our CEO of Motorola, Dennis, has built a world-class team and they are working on the opportunities. It is still early days but I am excited about the innovative ways they are approaching product development and speed of their execution and they recently signed and agreement to sell more Motorola's home division for $2.35 billion.","2012 was an amazing year for Google and we are all set for a great 2013. I am incredibly optimistic about the opportunities we have as a technology company focused on user benefits. Every day I come to work excited about more and bigger opportunities and every day we work to have more and better organized Googlers, those are employees, improving the execution and overall capabilities to deliver world the world changing products. I know it sounds funny but with the ambitious plans we have, we are only just getting started.","Our biggest challenge in this area is focus. We face so many opportunities and so it is important to thoughtfully invest in the right areas where we can have the greatest impact. We don't want to describe ourselves too thin, but I am quite optimistic that as we get better and better in managing our product areas, we will be able to continue to grow our ambitions. That's why I am here and that's one reason why Google Earth, now working at Google. Google Earth remains our greatest asset and we are working hard to recruit and retain the best employees. We've had a great start to the year, by being in the Fortune Magazine's, the best company to work for in the U.S. for the fourth time.","We worked hard to create a company, where everyone is part of the family and where the work is challenging and rewarding, so I'm really happy to get that recognition. I want to finish by thanking all the Googlers who made this possible, and now I'll turn it over to Patrick. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. So, let's dive in by reviewing the detail of our overall business financial performance. As we noted in a blog post last week, the Motorola Home business has been presented separately as discontinued operations in our financial tables. This makes typical quarter-on-quarter or year-on-year comparisons a little more challenging this quarter, but I will provide some color throughout my comments. So without further ado, here we go.","Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 36% year-over-year to $14.4 billion, and 8% quarter-over-quarter. As I mentioned, this figure excludes the Motorola Home revenue. Had we included Motorola Home, gross total consolidated revenue would have been $15.2 billion, a growth rate of 44% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter.","Google standalone gross revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $12.9 billion and 12% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google Website revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $8.6 billion and up 12% quarter-over-quarter with strengths across most geographies and industries. Our Google Network revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $3.4 billion and 10% quarter-over-quarter, finally, other revenue grew 102% year-over-year to $829 million and 24% quarter-over-quarter driven by Play hardware and content sales. And were it not for fluctuations in currencies Google standalone revenue would have in fact grown 24% year-over-year.","Turning to Motorola Mobility, its gross revenue was $1.5 billion for the quarter. And once again had we included the Home business, the total gross revenue for the combined Motorola entities would have been $2.3 billion. As Larry mentioned, we are really pleased with the velocity of change at Motorola, but it's still at a very beginning of the Motorola Google story. No one should be surprised if results from this segment are a variable for quite a while as we restructure the business. And remember, we inherited a 12 to 18 months product pipeline that we are still working through.","At Google Now, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong, up 24% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter. As we said many times, there are several factors that impact the CPC click dynamics, including FX, geo mix, product changes et cetera, but this quarter specifically it's worth mentioning that we implemented some policy changes that lowered our paid click growth, improved our CPC growth and lowered network revenue for the quarter. Nikesh will speak more about this in a few minutes, but the bottom line is, that these policies are part of many constant changes that are focused on what's good for the user and advertisers, so we believe they are good for Google's business in the long-term too.","Our aggregate cost per click was down 6% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Once again remember that currency headwinds also had a moderate year-on-year negative impact on CPC in Q4. In fixed FX terms, in fact aggregate CPC would have been down only 4% year-over-year and up 1% quarter-over-quarter.","Turning to geographic performance of Google's standalone business we continue to see strong performance in the U.S. and the U.K. while the economic situation of Southern Europe continues to impact our rest of world growth somewhat. In our earning slides, which you can find on our investor relations website, you will see that we have broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K., and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.","Revenue from the U.S. was up 20% year-over-year to $6 billion. The U.K. was up 23% year-over-year to $1.3 billion which includes [an immaterial] [ph] benefit from our hedging program. In fact in fixed FX terms the U.K. grew 22%. Non-U.S. Revenue, excluding the U.K., accounted for 44% of our total revenue or $5.6 billion, up 24% year-over-year and includes a $36 million benefit from our hedging program and in fixed FX terms rest of world grew 28%.","So now if I come back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business, our other cost of revenue was $3 billion in Q4, excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring, our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.1 billion, which also exclude SBC and Motorola restructuring and our non-GAAP operating profit was $4.3 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 30%. For standalone Google, traffic acquisition costs were $3.1 billion or 25% of total advertising revenue.","Our other cost of revenue was $1.8 billion excluding $101 million of stock-based compensation. The increase year-over-year was driven by equipment costs, including the cost associated with hardware sales on Play but also content acquisition costs and our data center costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $3.6 billion excluding stock-based compensation of $576 million. Finally, non-GAAP operating profit was $4.4 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 34%.","One last note. Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment for standalone Google was $493 million for this quarter. At Motorola Mobility, total non-GAAP operating expenses including cost of revenue were $1.7 billion and keep in mind that intangible amortization expense attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola mobility, they are included in these non-GAAP measures.","Of the $289 million in intangible amortization expense this quarter, $153 million was a result of the acquisition of Motorola and of which $116 million is allocated to Google and $37 million allocated to Motorola Mobility. As a result, the non-GAAP operating loss on Motorola Mobility was $152 million in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of negative 10% for that segment.","Let me turn to headcount. Headcount for the consolidated headcount increased by roughly 300 people in Q4. Keep in mind that consolidated headcount includes Motorola Home until it is divested and Home comprises roughly one third of the total Motorola headcount. Standalone Google added about 1,400 people and in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter at around 53,900 full-time employees.","Our effective tax rate this quarter was 18%. The change from last quarter reflects the mix in shifts of earnings between domestic and international subsidiary and hedges.","Now let me turn quickly to cash management. Other income and expense was 152 million for quarter, which reflects realized gains on investments and interest income offset by the continued impact of FAS 133 expense from our hedging program. For more details on OI&E, please again refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.","Our operating cash flow was very strong, $4.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $1 billion versus last quarter of $872 million. The majority of CapEx expense was related to production equipment, data center construction and facilities related purchases. We are very pleased with our free cash flow which was $3.7 billion and please note that cash flow and CapEx both include the Home business for now.","So finally the success of our products and our continued strong performance, as portrayed by Larry's comments continues to give us the confidence to fund our strategic growth in areas such as search, YouTube, Android, Chrome as well as in our overall infrastructure with a view to the long-term. I will hand off now to Nikesh who will cover in more detail of our business performance in the quarter and after his remarks, we will open it up for the phone lines for any questions. Nikesh?","Nikesh Arora","Thank you, Patrick. As Larry and Patrick have mentioned, our business had a strong quarter with $12.9 billion revenue in Google standalone alone. We are very pleased with our year-on-year growth of 22%. I think our advertising business is firing on all cylinders. Companies of all sizes continue to embrace online advertising and our major players increasing their investments. In fact, here's an interesting tidbit. Across search display, YouTube and more, our top 25 advertisers are now spending average of over $150 million per year. Did I deliver that number?","Our core business continues to be strong. Our investments in mobile shopping, our past holiday test with Flying Colors. As Larry mentioned, our vision is for search to understand exactly what you mean and give you exactly what you want in all devices that you live with throughout your day.","Talking about the devices, our queries from wide ranging of new devices are continuing to power our overall growth in search volumes. Distinctions between devices, form factors are becoming less meaningful, particularly between desktop, laptops and tablets.","Our Search performed very well last quarter during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We still have greater proportion of queries with commercial intent and higher RPMs in areas like retail, computers and electronics. We launched a set of features to make shopping stress free and more fun. I don't know if you've had a chance to look at it, but there are some interesting things like 360 degree toy imagery and integrating retailers' promotions and discounts into our shopping product.","Our investments in Search, particularly in mobile and shopping are really helping clients. Now, let me give you an example. Front End Audio. This is the company that offers recording and light sound equipment sales. Sometime in mid-September, the deployed product lifting ads, within weeks these ads were accounting for about 15% of the total sales. They also tripled their click through rates and also reduced their cost per conversion by 75% to 80%. This is great for us, because the product we believe is in the interest of the end users. It's a great product for Front End Audio improves their economics and improves our economy.","Major retailers like RadioShack and Home Depot, they use our Mobile Apps 3 shoppers across devices, including click-to-call, click-to-map. For Home Depot, mobile commerce sales are quadrupled in a year. Patrick mentioned some changes in policy and enforcement. These enforcements had the effect of reducing ad clicks on the sites of certain AdSense for search partners. These policy updates are part of our ongoing work to improve user experiences on Google and on site in terms of using Google Search. Since these policies improve the experience of both users and advertisers, we firmly believe they are good for our business in the long-term.","Switching gears to YouTube in display, we are continuing to make strong progress here, but there was a key language that brand speak, so it continues to be a key area of focus for us. Videos are baked into the core of all of our products whether it's search, display, mobile, and of course YouTube itself.","YouTube is well positioned for the changing viewing habits of today's multi-screen world. The site's new redesign is focused on channels and that has led to major increase in engagement. In 2012, viewers watched over 4 billion hours of video on YouTube a month and it's now available across over 400 million mobile devices, gaming consoles and connector PDs in addition to your desktop.","YouTube creators continue to vow and attract audiences. Outside estimate say that video on which I am sure all of you have seen of PSY, his hit song, Gangnam Style, now the most watched YouTube video for all times, it generated over $8 million in all-in advertising deal. YouTube Partner revenue has doubled for the fourth consecutive year and thousands of channels are now making six figures annually.","YouTube is not only home for creators, but it's also home for major brand advisers. On YouTube, our top 100 global advertisers spent over 50% more in 2012 than they did in 2011. Clearly this is a strong signal of the power in YouTube to reach audiences. What's interesting is the significant factor into growth of YouTube has been our TrueView skippable ad format. Agencies and marketers are seeing real benefits. You only pay for the ad if viewers watch them. In fact, 70% of our in-stream ads are now TrueView formats and this quarter TrueView came to Xbox, the iPad, and the Wii.","Putting all our advertiser solutions together, it is really helping us deliver greater returns and develop close relationships with major clients worldwide. Like McDonald's, who this quarter launched always on search in YouTube campaign to increase customer awareness and their ability towards their brands across all channels.","In Q4, we signed a new global deal with L'Oreal, under which we worked to promote their brands using Google's digital offerings across the world in Display, Search, YouTube and more. While our complete solution for marketers not only applies to businesses, but we saw this in this quarter's 2012 election from the presidency to local races.","Google's mobile search, video and measurement products were the center of a huge number of Democratic, Republican initiatives and campaigns. Our election advertising revenues increased by five times over the 2008 election. Here is an interesting statistic for you. In nine of the top 11 Senate races for the U.S., the candidates who spent more with Google, was elected.","Well, 2012 was not just a big year for advertising, it was a big year for publisher business as well. Working closely with major publishers, from weather channel to timing, bringing the DoubleClick Google ad technology stack together is really helping our clients increase their direct, indirect and programmatic CPMs. Our solutions for media companies now (inaudible) be on advertising encompassing paid service, subscriptions and more.","That was about our business, our ad revenue. Other highlights looking at the geographic breakdown of our ads business. Growth in Northern Europe was robust, with strength in Germany and the U.K. Asia performed steadily and other regions were very pleased that Americas maintain steady growth driven by strength in mobile and YouTube. Southern Europe was somewhat softer as it continues to face macroeconomic challenges.","Our enterprise business continues to grow at an impressive pace. It's been gaining traction across some of the largest companies in the world. New customers this quarter include Nintendo, the Canadian Broadcasting Company, Shaw industries, Costco, Randstad and Hyundai to name a few. Also signing in May is the U.S. Department of Interior, moved more than 70,000 employees to the cloud during Q4 making it the largest federal agency to date using Google Apps.","I think I solid, we have had a good quarter. Our revenues continue to grow. Clients continue to see value with us and value in online advertising. We have been able to build significant new revenue streams at mobile, YouTube and display and clearly arising one in enterprise. We have weathered various economic storms and are benefiting from the shift in advertising spend towards digital media plus there is continued strong execution and client relationships.","I want to echo Larry's congratulations to our teams around the world for all their hard work in delivering a great quarter and stellar year in a tough environment. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Nikesh. With that, I am going to turn it over to Jennifer who will open the lines for the Q&A. Jennifer, all yours.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner - Bernstein","Two questions. Last quarter we saw a material sequential decline of Google websites' revenues growth rate of more than 400 basis points. Even after accounting for FX, this quarter we see another deceleration I think about 250 basis points on an FX neutral basis in the Google websites' revenue line. Of these, in the context where YouTube is growing really fast based on your comments, so what have been the major drivers of this continued deceleration of Google websites? Should we expect similar growth rate declines going forward? ","Secondly on TAC, it seems TAC for distribution as a percentage of Google websites' revenues grew less than what we had seen earlier in the last several quarters in 2012. What has driven the stabilization of this TAC, distribution TAC and how should we think about distribution TAC in the future? Thank you.","Larry Page","Well, thank you, Carlos for the detailed question. I am going to turn that over to Patrick for, hopefully, a good answer.","Patrick Pichette","Yes, thank you. So Carlos, on the first one, you are right that there is quite a bit of noise because of FX on the sites year-over-year between Q3 and Q4 but overall I think that we are very pleased with the growth around 20%. You are right that in the last quarter there was a bit more headwinds than this quarter but overall the core search business is doing well and driven really by the strength in mobile and we are obviously additionally pleased with the YouTube business, particularly the watch page. So, despite the fact that there is quite a bit of FX noise in there and that FX does carry over to sites, overall I think that we are very pleased with the overall growth.","In terms of TAC I think that that\u2019s the case where obviously our mobile revenue is growing and it is having impact on our mix shift. That\u2019s really the fundamental trend that you see in TAC rather than change in the TAC rate of any particular partner. So that\u2019s really what's going on there but I think as we said in the previous calls we think of TAC in the way, there is a really positive story in TAC, which is, it is distribution and it is worth paying for.","This is the positive side of our business having much more distribution of our apps across and that\u2019s true also for mobile. So we are really thrilled that all of the mobile is thriving to the extent that it is and remember that, finally, TAC is not a new phenomenon for us. We have always dealt with distribution partners and we'll continue to experience and manage it to make sure that it drives revenue and profit for both parties in a balanced way, so nothing new here but really excited by the trends.","Thank you Carlos. We will go to our next question, please.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie","Two questions for Larry around the notion of Answers not linked. First on Knowledge Graph, can you just give us a high level view on where we are in terms of its implementation and how widely it's rolled out? And specifically, how if at all it impacts the economics of Google's businesses? ","And then second Google Shopping, the PLAs and the interface changes, I think significantly improve the user experience, but the consumer still needs to leave the site to transact. Do you anticipate a mechanism whereas users can actually transact on Google Shopping without having to leave? You know, as you said sort of no extra work needed? Thanks.","Larry Page","Well, Ben, thank you for the questions. I think we rolled out Knowledge Graph very recently and I think we are still in the early stages of that. I think that, I mentioned some of the internationalization work that we did which is hard work and I think we'll continue to do that. I mean it's still 1% or something where we should be, so I am really excited about what we can do in the future. I think the economics points, I think that the way we look at it is we provide much better answers for people really grow the business. We increased the number times that you might want information, because you know you are going to get correct answers or increasing it for modalities, you can get answers like Voice, or Mobile or so on, so I am somewhat excited about that and generally we monetize those things. So, I don\u2019t have a comment on specifics of that, but it think we are quite excited about that.","The Knowledge Graph does run on the right hand side where the ads also run. [I expect] [ph] there could be some short-term impacts on that, but I think the primary thing is getting people better answers is really good for our business. ","Google Shopping, I guess you are asking about product listing ads I think that we are also in the early stages of that. We just rolled out Google Shopping. We\u2019ve seen tremendous uptake from merchants and from users and I expect that quality of the site, the ease of  buying things will improve over time and I am really excited about that. I am not going to comment on details about that, but we\u2019re always focused on making our user experience better. So, can we have our next question please?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.","Scott Devitt - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. I guess, following up on Ben's comment regarding Answers versus Links. Larry, you recently quoted I think saying about the possibility of having a system that could basically vacation plan for you. And now that you own ITA and Frommer\u2019s and Zagat and you've built out travel explorer or flight explorer and Hotel Finder. Can you talk a bit more about the strategy with travel in terms of the problem you are trying to solve there relative to this historic experience of Google sending you offsite for depth of experience. And then secondly, Patrick, I think last quarter you gave the FX neutral CPC down 8%. I wonder if you could give that same number for this quarter, thanks. For the fourth quarter?","Larry Page","Yes, Scott. That's a great question. I'll take the first part, and I think that we've always done a very good job of sending people to the right places and I don't think that being able to answer very complex information means necessarily that we wouldn't send people off to other sites, So I think the main thing for us is to be able to understand the complex problem. Like, I think, I gave some example like finding a hotel that's near (inaudible) logistics for the flight, for a vacation you might take and the hotel and the activities we wanted to do, kind of solving that all at once in a way a human assistant might be able to do.","And, you still might use other parties to do that transaction, so I don\u2019t necessarily believe the assumption of your question, but we are looking at those things. It was more of an example. I think Google\u2019s aspiration is to be able to that for any area. Not just travel and we have been working with as many companies as we can and trying to organize the web\u2019s information. And where we needed to acquire companies, we have done some of that or work with other companies or make deals or whatever we need to do. So we are trying to be practical about it and I think we do have some amazing assets in travel and mapping and so on. I think those things will pay off for us in the future providing great experience. So, Patrick?","Patrick Pichette","Yes, Scott, the answer to your specific question is, the CPCs have, on a year-over-year basis, they have gone down 4% and on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they are 1%. That is on a fixed FX adjusted and so that compares to the minus six and plus two that I mentioned a couple of minutes ago. Thanks for your questions, Scott. Jennifer, let's go to our next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets","Great, thanks. Two questions. Could you talk broadly where you are on cash about Google Maps and where do you think the monetization of that is today versus where you think it potentially could be? Then, Larry, I think you were quoted recently with some comments on competitive products out in the market. Any comments, in particular, on graphical search as it has been announced and to what extent you think that\u2019s complementary or competitive with Google's core search? Thank you very much.","Larry Page","Well, I can say a little bit about Maps. So this is Larry. I think that people are always focused on monetization of Maps but it's important to think about, for me, it\u2019s the history of Maps. We started working on Maps a long, long time ago and because we thought it was critical to your search experience.","It is actually finding what you are looking for and if we look at our component of queries that are geographically related, it\u2019s a huge number and always has been. So again, to understand those queries we have to understand where things are in the real world. So that\u2019s been always the core part of our main web search.","We already make quite a bit of money on web search and I already told you that was a significant amount of queries. So we actually we already make quite a bit of money on Maps in that way as a part of our core business, and a significant part, which really allowed us to make those investments.","We are in the early stages of monetization on the Maps themselves. I think we are doing some interesting things there. I think we will continue to do that. I think it is likely to be a great source of revenue but still in the early stages on the Maps, but on the search side, we have significant revenue already.","I think you are asking about graph search, which was recently announced. I think that when leaving about search, our mission has been to organize the world's information and making it universally accessible and useful. We have been at that for quite a while and made investments in all sorts of areas, like Maps, as I just mentioned which turned out to be really important. That\u2019s the way we think about. There is knowledge search, there is all sorts of investments we have made, gathering different kinds of data and making sure we have everyone's data and we will continue to do that. That business has change a lot.","Only 10 years ago, what you though Google should do, is almost unrecognizable compared to what it does now and the number of things that it understands. So we see just tremendous opportunity to make better products for users that really understand their needs and really grow that opportunity and if you look at voice, for example, which we have also made huge investment in, the importance of that to mobile for finding things. I mentioned you can ask Google where the nearest gas station is on your phone while you are driving on your phones and it does all this work perfectly. So I think we see that as just all sorts of aspects on those problem and we have been very focused on that.","Now there is another great example. There is tremendous innovation there. It is actually answering your question before you even think to have the question and that's pretty incredible. I am super excited about that, so I feel very confident of our core business of organizing things, finding things, getting people information. I couldn't be more excited about that. Our next question?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Anthony Diclemente with Barclays.","Anthony Diclemente - Barclays","Hi. First for Patrick on Motorola in terms of the lawsuit which widened in the quarter, I am wondering if you could contextualize for us the financial direction of Motorola, both, in terms of the revenue declining and the growing expenses. I mean, I know this isn't something that Google typically does, but I think it would be helpful for investors if there's any way to kind of put a band or threshold around what the potential operating losses could be at Motorola.","And then second question for Larry around the commercialization of driverless cars. I just wonder if you could give us an update on that and your test that you're doing in Nevada and I am wondering if you could talk about Android as part of that? It sounds like the automotive, electronics suppliers are recognizing the importance of Android for the infotainment systems in those cars and so maybe you can talk a little bit about that opportunity for Android as well? Thanks for the question.","Larry Page","I think maybe I'll take the second half of your question first. I think that, I would say also on Motorola and then I will let Patrick fill in. I mean we are so excited about them in this. I think that we're really in the early days of Motorola with respect to Google's acquisition of it, and I'll let him give you some details.","I think that on driverless cars, I think obviously it's still early days to answer. Although I'm really excited about what the team has got done and what that can mean for ordinary people and really substantially improving mobility and potentially really reducing the land area that we have to devote for cars which is incredible amounts in cities. It can really reduce parking. We are looking at that. Even for Google just as a major cost to reduce our parking costs in our facilities by having automated cars parked more densely and serve more people.","I think those things will be amazing deals. Android I think that we are still. That's little bit different than the automated cars I think, but Android won't be used in cars probably before we get automated cars into the mainstream. I think people are really excited about that due to the incredible success of Android and we are obviously working with those manufacturers to help them make that happen well. So, Patrick?","Patrick Pichette","Yes, just a bit of color on Motorola. Right? First just to remind everybody, we do care about profitability and that is our goal with every one of the areas where we invest, and we said that before and we are not in the business for losing money with Motorola or even cross subsiding it. But, we are really 180 days into this journey and we've made a ton of progress, including the sale of the Home business. And as I mentioned earlier also we are kind of outsourcing our manufacturing and so much more that has been done and the restructurings that you have heard earlier in the late summer and early fall.","So, and I just want to remind everybody that we inherited kind of 12 to 18 months of product pipeline that we have to work through and that's the reality of the business, that's kind of overhaul and then kind of rebuild the new product pipeline where Dennis's team has kind of been really focused on in addition to the restructuring. It does take time before it shows up.","Having said that finally on the financials themselves, Anthony, it's really worth noting that Motorola is also hindered by a portion of the amortization of intangibles due to the acquisition, so the losses that you see are somewhat inflated by this amortization of intangibles which we've decided to kind of put through the P&L on a non-GAAP basis.","So, all-in-all, when we look at the losses like this quarter, a negative $150 million, you take out the amortization, these are not consequential losses relative to either Google or the kind of turnaround we are seeing and the kind of positive momentum. So, that's why Larry started by saying we are really optimistic, but it does take time and that's why I am also saying, be ready for a lot of fluctuations in our P&L over the coming quarters. It's just the nature of the bees when you reinvent business. Thank you for your question, Anthony. Let's go, Jennifer, to our next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Larry, I think on your last call, you mentioned that you are impatient with mobile CPCs, not that they were not bad place but you wanted to get them higher. Can you talk about progress made in the quarter and do you feel like you are really making a positive inflection there or is that still a few quarters away?","Then as you as you look at your mobile business as far as the growth of queries or the growth of revenues and you look at it relative to maybe mcommerce growth, do you think you are gaining share of the market? Do you feel like your position in mobile is really secure and that you maybe even be gaining share in mobile or maybe the street doesn\u2019t recognize it? Thank you.","Larry Page","Thank you for your question. Let's see, the mobile business, it has been going very well. We have tremendous growth with the Android. We are serving our users really well. We are building amazing products that are getting better at a rapid rate. The rate of improvement are obviously very high. So I feel pretty comfortable that my focus mostly on our products and assume that their usage will follow the great products.","I think that in some sense, some of you may consider mobile an extension over the desktop usage too. I mean, we have built a lot of great products that people use for the desktops like Maps which was transferred very well. And I think that one thing I was amazed by Chrome on my Android phone, Chrome is just an amazing experience. So, using my Nexus phone or other more smartphones from the latest generation, those phones are almost like using a desktop of last year or something like that.","So I think the experiences are improving a lot and very, very quickly. So I think we have hit some uncharted territory, because of the rapid rate of change in these things but I am very, very optimistic about it. I think that CPCs will improve as these devices are improving as well. Obviously, I mentioned that we are working to simplify our ad system for advertisers. In the light of all these changes and I am excited about our plans there.","We don\u2019t have anything to announce today but I am very excited about our efforts there. I think that we will make rapid progress in that area. So I think I answered both of your questions. So maybe we can have our next question.","Operator","We will take our next question from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse","Thanks, guys. So I guess the pace of your headcount increases is used to be moderating as we take a look back 2012 and the same goes for CapEx as well. So do you feel like you are now at an appropriate level to tackle your three major areas of investment focus?","I guess another way to ask the question is, are there any other large scale opportunities you have identified that would entail acceleration in terms of your hiring or CapEx? Thank you.","Larry Page","I think we have run a number of different businesses and I think that they all have different needs and it's sort of like, we are looking at the sum of all those things. So I think it is a little bit hard to predict those things. I think you should ask us to do whatever is necessary to make the most business outcome. Having said that, I think we have some time in the past we have had a lot of people, we are growing at the edge of what's been the modest in terms of scaling. I think that\u2019s still the case. We would say, that\u2019s moderated but I would say that we have also slowed our international growth and products development a bit which is probably having some impact on that. So I guess, I will give it to Patrick for some more detail, perhaps.","Patrick Pichette","Okay, just the comment on the CapEx side. We have always said and I think if you go back the last couple of years on CapEx, it has been really lumpy. We have gone from really highs where we were above $1 billion and then it's come all the way down to a few hundred million dollars.","Now it's kind of moved back up, so it's a real testimony that it is lumpy, because as you add, just to use the example of a data center, as you will see CapEx, because we fill with equipment at data center. But once the data center is full and then we have to put an extension to the data center or then you are into concrete again and power. So, it's just the nature of our business.","Certainly on the core businesses are quite lumpy, so we without giving any guidance forward, we have been as you've seen in this quarter $1 billion of CapEx, really very much aligned with the excitement we have around our products, whether it be social, whether it be pictures, whether it be all of the areas that you have heard Larry talk about and so that's why we are fueled as I said in my comments.","We are fueled by the positive momentum we have in many areas of the company and we believe now is the time to invest and that's why we are doing it with confidence, discipline with confidence.","Larry Page","Ross, I'll also just add briefly that when we run our business, we find that it works better if our hiring is reasonably smooth, so we have worked harder to manage that smoothness. We have recruiters in place and hiring staff in place for the long-term and make sure we'll provide a good consistent business growth there just makes us operationally run better and we've probably been managing that a bit more tightly.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks for your question, Steven. Let's go to our next question, please, Jennifer.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank Securities.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities","Thanks guys. I have got two questions, first for Nikesh on Mobile and then one follow-up for Patrick on the Google sites TAC. So, Nikesh, what percent of your several million advertising clients are bidding on mobile key words today and what percentage do you think have mobile-specific websites enabled already?","And then Patrick, the follow-up on TAC, the year-over-year growth rate for Google website's TAC decelerated from 45% to 43%, subtle but there is probably some organic items in there that are helping it. Is that a function of smartphone installation growth rolling over or any partnership agreements or something else? Can you just give us a little color on that deceleration? Thanks.","Nikesh Arora","Thanks for your question, Ross. On the mobile front, I think it's important to understand that a vast majority of our advertisers have opted into mobile from an advertising point of view. I think Larry said this a few quarters ago that we slowly have been working over time to try and make it feel like a common experience across multiple screens for advertisers, because advertisers are more interested in the business benefit of advertising with us as opposed to specifically which form factor, which device they invest with us on, so our teams have been working really hard in the last few quarters to try and get us to a point where we can make it simple for the advertiser where they come to us with a business problem and we are able to solve it for them irrespective of device, irrespective of form factor or property that they are going to have advertise on. So, from that perspective, I think things are going in the right direction.","As far as specifically how many advertisers have mobile landing pages that they can send their users to? That number is not as much as we would like it. Obviously, we've had programs, we have talked about in the past earning calls like GoMo which help businesses go mobile, so those efforts are bearing fruit but broadly speaking, I think we are happy with the progress we have made both on getting advertisers to be more mobilized and also what we are doing from a campaign management perspective to get more and more campaigns that can run across all devices and form factors.","Larry Page","I'll just add on the mobile question. We don\u2019t necessarily want them to have mobile sites some are too simple and I find I get kind of frustrated on my phone sometimes when I have these mobile specific sites because I am using a modern Nexus 4 that can actually view up the full site and I just find it confusing.","So, I think as an industry, we need to improve these experiences and that will take a bit of time, but I'd almost say that we should be designing for mobile the kind of mobile phones that we had now the state-of-the-art or a little bit beyond and that those experiences should work on all devices pretty well, so I'd actually like to us go more in that direction perhaps, so Patrick?","Patrick Pichette","Just on my side, I need Ross, I need you to actually call us after this. Because, when I look at our TAC for the Google Web as a percentage of website revenue, it is pretty stable to us and every way we look at it is pretty stable. So I am not sure if there is anything you are looking into it that we are missing but don't hesitate to follow-up with the IR team afterwards. But we don\u2019t see any deceleration in any meaningful way on the website side. Thanks, Ross.","Larry Page","Great, can we have our next question?","Operator","Yes, we will take our next question from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.","Richard Kramer - Arete Research","Thanks very much. Larry, a couple of quick questions. First of all, just to polish up this Mobile and CPC question, how many years do you think it's going to take before CPCs on Mobile and Desktop are roughly equal trading off location and display size?","Another question, looking broadly at the business, there are a number of geographical markets like China where you are simply not able to operate. Do you see any prospect for being able to enter some of those markets in the medium term? Or do you think that the business is still going to be geographically constrained?","Then a quick one for Patrick, will there be an impairment test coming up on Motorola especially with respect to the IPR given the FTC settlement around Standards-Essential Patent? Thanks.","Larry Page","Thanks, Richard, for all the questions. I think that's a threefer. The problem seems to be, and I am not going to make predictions about when they will be equal; I don't think they will be equal, I think probably one will always be bigger than the other, though, not clear which way but I don't think this is a long-term problem. I don't think this is a long time in coming, and I think as I have said before, there's a lot of advantages to mobile.","You already know location quite clearly, you can call somebody easily, you have a camera, you can hangout with the business, you can be notified instantly. There's just a lot of things about mobile that are amazing opportunities for advertisers and for businesses. So I expect that to revolutionize how people do marketing and we are working hard on that. I expect that that will work a lot better for users and for advertisers and businesses, and therefore more money. We will be able to generate a lot more money than we do now.","Okay, so maybe Nikesh can address China.","Nikesh Arora","I thought I was getting the mobile CPC question, Larry.","Larry Page","You can do the second one first, though.","Nikesh Arora","Okay, I think it is fair to say we do operate in China right now. We have an ad sales business. We have a display business in the market. We know there is many users who use Android devices in the market. I think what's important to understand is the reason we decided to not operate in China was because we believe that we wanted to make sure that users are able to have unfettered access to our products, and the products where we believe they have ability to access in an unfettered fashion we do operate in the market.","It's only the ones where they aren't able to access in the way we would like to, in which case they are able to access it through our operations in Hong Kong. So we think we operate in China, not in the way you might perceive it, but users have access to our services and there is even a small revenue business that we have in China.","Larry Page","Oaky, so, Patrick, what might be an impairment to us for Motorola?","Patrick Pichette","Obviously, every time there is any formal kind of transactions or events that occur, we have to look at our balance sheet and if is any impairment test. In the case of Motorola, we don't think there is actually right now. We have no information even with the Standards-Essential Patent. There is no information right now that leads us to believe that we have to do an impairment test on any of it.","Remember that the Standards-Essential Patent for Motorola is a very small portion of the entire portfolio pool of patents that we got out of Motorola. So, just put that in the context as well. So, thanks for your question, Richard. Why don\u2019t we go to the next question, Jennifer.","Operator","We will take our next question from Neil Doshi with Citigroup.","Neil Doshi - Citi","Thanks. Can you provide more details around the policy changes that were implemented in the quarter, and whether they will continue to have an impact on CPCs and paid clicks in Q1?","Then also we were recently at the NRF convention in New York and we saw a demo of the Google Zavers product where users can click coupons, and then use those coupons in the offline retail world. How big of an opportunity is really bridging the online ads with off-line transactions for Google and this is something that's a key initiative as we go into 2013? Thanks.","Larry Page","Thanks, Neil, for your question. So I think that Nikesh can give us some color on the policy.","Nikesh Arora","I think it's fair to say what we did was, we\u2019ve always had a policy. The policy has been that we want to make sure that whatever ads are presented in whatever way our traffic is routed to ads, it is done in the best interest of the user and we began to notice that they were sites and pages whereas we had too many ads in a page, so it became more restrictive and updated our policies for better enforcement and that has resulted in higher quality results for end users, it has reduced in some cases the monetization that some of our partners are seeing as a result of this enforcement and hence you are seeing the impact on the numbers.","We just announced this policy sometime early this quarter, in the past quarter that we just went through, so you are going to see the impact over the next few quarters. We've also implemented more stringent policies around downloadable apps, and that's why I think both those effects are going to stay with us for the year, but we think in the long-term is the right answer for us, it's the right answer for users and it's right answer for advertisers, so we think it's a good thing to do.","Larry Page","We've been doing things like that for a while just making sure we are focused on user experience in our advertising products and we found that that's been a very good long-term focus for our business that has really benefitted us. I think that's kind of the ordinary course of it there.","You mentioned bridging online ads with offline transactions. As I said mobile will increase the value of these kind of businesses. That's an example of it, which can actually measure if somebody gets an offer that they redeemed it in a real store or they went in the store or whatever it is. And so, we are very excited about that, but we\u2019re still in the early stages of really making those solutions work for consumers, advertisers and so on, but I think it's a great area that you highlighted that.","So, can we go to our next question?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Hi, great. I had a question for Larry. I was just wondering if you could share with us your initial thoughts on the Google Fiber rollout. And also if you could outline for us your vision for the product if you look out over the next few years and how this might fit into your opening comments about multiple screens and unprecedented change in the consumer compute arena?","Larry Page","Well, I think it's been great to see the success there with the initial Fiber rollout. We are still in the very early stages of it. Obviously, we are going to a small number of people and so on, but we are excited about the possibilities there of getting people kind of give you the experience and really great Internet experience.","Patrick, do you want to add anything there?","Patrick Pichette","Yes. We are really focused on Kansas City right now and you've probably seen in the press. It's called now the Silicon Prairie. It's got a lot of press, because we've started to roll out, we started the implementation and the installs. We are growing up in terms of installs weeks after week and people just love the product. So, you are absolutely right, Heather, that we are really excited about this product and it's been a great success overall.","So, while we are going to continue and as we've said all along, and here is another great example of one where it's not a hobby, we really think that we should be making good business with this opportunity and we are going to continue to look at the possibility of expanding, but right now we just got to nail because we are in the early days. We just got to nail Kansas City. It's a perfect place for us to kind of debug all of the elements of the product and the experience for the users, but all-in-all, what a great opportunity to deliver kind of 100 times the average speed and that's what people are just dying to get everywhere. We have time for probably one last question.","Larry Page","Sorry I missed the second part of the question too, but it's a pretty big question, you wanted me to outline the vision for the products looking over the next few years. I guess the best way to predict the future is to make it, so that's what we are trying to do. I don't have anything specific to announce this time, but I couldn't be more excited about some of the things I mentioned on Google Now of really understanding  what your question is before you have it. Wouldn't that be great at the earnings call if we just answered all of your questions without you asking them, because that will be less work for you all. So, I think some of those things could really be reality and I think if you look at knowledge panels and I recently asked like really obscure question I was looking at the height of a bridge. I was like what's the height of the bridge? And I typed into the Google and it just spit out the answer, and I was dumbfounded you know but I didn't have to go and research that.","So, I think some of those things would seem kind of like science fiction where we are really getting to Google apps. Sergey has really taken on and he used to think that was science fiction and he is running around with it wearing it, as am I sometimes as well. So, I think we are just really excited about the future and I think the rate of innovation in the world is increasing, and also I think Google and that's just really exciting place to be.","Patrick Pichette","We actually saw Sergey in New York last weekend, in the subway with his plastic bags and all. So we have time for one last question.","Operator","We will take our last question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan","Great, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask you about Display to start. I think in the last couple of years you have given a run rate in 4Q. I was hoping you could do that again for this past quarter and then also just talk about the early feedback and contribution from the YouTube App on iOS and then lastly any update on the features, timing and the process there? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","So let me just jump on display. As we said many times in the past, we will give occasionally kind of numbers here and there just to give a sense of momentum, but we don't give them quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year. So that's exactly the case for display. And in the case of early feedback on the contribution for YouTube App on iOS, I will leave it to Nikesh.","Nikesh Arora","We are very excited about the iOS app that we put out there, not just for YouTube but also for Google Maps. We think they both have tremendous amount of success and it's an illustration of how, if you focus on the user and produce a great experience, it doesn't matter what platform it is. People will adopt it and adapt it and take to it. I think our partners and we both are excited about that fact that these apps are successful. I don't think it's just a unilateral view. Back to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Sorry, I just saw, Doug, your question on the C Shares. Look, as we said previously, this recapitalization is subject to (inaudible) pending litigation right now and once the litigation has been resolved, we expect our Board of Directors to determine the exact timing of issuing the dividend. So, we can't really predict it yet, because it's litigation, but we don't expect it to occur before the second quarter of this year. That's where we stand on that.","With that, I just want to thank everybody who joining us today on the call. Wish everybody a really prosperous and happy new year. As Nikesh and Larry said, two-thumps up to all our Googlers for a phenomenal 2012 and making it a place of choice and look forward to an exciting 2013.","With that Jennifer, I am going to let you close the call.","Operator","Alright, thank you.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz\/investor.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.","Sundar Pichai","Thank you, Ellen, and good afternoon.","Q3 was another great quarter at Google with strong revenue growth driven by mobile search, YouTube, and Cloud. We celebrated Google's 21st birthday this quarter. While our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful hasn't changed, we've evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done.","Since the beginning, we've always invested in tackling deep computer science problems that can have a significant impact on society. The chance to be part of these fundamental engineering challenges is why so many people want to work at Google. In just the last week we have announced two significant advances. First, powered by our long-term investment in AI, we dramatically improved our understanding of the questions people ask Google Search. It's the biggest leap forward for search in the past five years. It\u2019s all possible because of a new type of neural network-based technique for natural language processing called BERT, which recognizes subtle patterns in language and provides more relevant results.","Second, we recently announced a major quantum computing milestone. I was extraordinarily proud to visit our team in Santa Barbara. To demonstrate supremacy, Google's 53-qubit quantum machine Sycamore, successfully performed a test computation in just 200 seconds that would have taken the most powerful supercomputers much longer time to accomplish. It's the Hello, World! moment we\u2019ve been waiting for and represents a distinct milestone in our effort to harness the principles of quantum mechanics, to solve computational problems.","Turning from quantum to the quarter. Today, I'll talk about the momentum we saw across the business in the last three months. First, Cloud. We saw customer momentum across multiple areas under Thomas\u2019 leadership. In September, we announced a landmark partnership with Mayo Clinic. Using Google Cloud to secure and store data and understand insights at scale, Mayo Clinic will partner with us in many ways. Together, we'll work to transform patient and clinician experiences, identify new methods of diagnosing diseases, conduct clinical research, and find new models for delivering patient care.","National Australia Bank recently added Google Cloud to its multi-cloud strategy to help the company better use data and deliver new and improved customer experiences. Deutsche B\u00f6rse Group, the fourth largest stock exchange group worldwide relies on Google Cloud to help them navigate the twin challenge of modernizing their digital operations and addressing significant regulatory requirements.","Retailers are also turning to cloud solutions to help make the shopping experience as seamless and personalized as possible. For example, Macy's uses Google Cloud to streamline their operations from the distribution center to the shop floor.","Public sector customers are modernizing their IT systems with Google Cloud with great results. For example, the state of Arizona already has more than 36,000 employees using our products to increase productivity, efficiency and security. And this quarter, it further extended our relationship.","We continue to extend our cloud services through partners, including a new solution that enables customers to run VMware workloads on GCP for the first time. We announced the cloud region in Nevada. When it launches in 2020, it will be our 7th cloud region in the U.S. We also announced a new cloud region in Poland, our 7th in Europe.","Turning to Google's product that people use every day. We're excited about new features lunched in maps, including detailed voice guidance while walking that will make it possible for people who have vision impairments or are blind, get around more easily. New tool that will allow users to see all of their flight and hotel reservations in one place. And another new feature that gives transit riders in 30 countries the ability to see ridesharing and biking options near their bus or train stop.","In Search, we made a number of improvements to make it easier for users to find key moments in videos, easily find products within images via Google Lens, and discover new podcast.","Our hardware business is still in its early stages, but we\u2019re continuing to build the business and a portfolio of helpful products. Two weeks ago, we unveiled our new Made by Google product lineup, bringing together the best of hardware, software, and AI.","Our new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are the first phones with motion sense. This allows users to use natural gestures to get things done without touching their phone. The new Google Assistant now gives users the ability to switch seamlessly between apps, all by voice. And the new Pixelbook Go provides many of the great features of our premium Pixelbook at a more affordable price point. We also unveiled a new, more powerful Nest Mini speaker and Nest WiFi. Finally, the team is looking forward to launching Pixel Buds, first truly wireless headphones, as well Stadia, our streaming gaming platform, which will soon be available in the U.S., UK, Canada and throughout Europe.","We are encouraged by the positive product reviews so far. With the holidays coming up, I think that's a gift for everyone on your list.","On to YouTube. Keeping YouTube safe for our users, creatives and partners, while preserving the openness of our platform is our top priority. This quarter, we continued to update our community guidelines and enforcement to protect users from harmful content and will keep doing this work. YouTube Music and YouTube Premium continue to expand globally and are now available in 71 countries. In September, YouTube launched its new fashion and beauty destination called YouTube\/Fashion. It's designed to meet the growing demand from consumers for better ways to explore and connect with some of YouTube's biggest fashion and beauty creatives.","And I want to emphasize that as we build all these helpful products, we are committed to giving users more control of their data. This quarter, we extended one of our most popular features in Chrome and YouTube, called Incognito Mode to Maps. We expanded our auto-delete controls to YouTube history. These controls already enable people to set their location history and web and app activity to be deleted automatically after 3 or 18 months. And to protect everyone\u2019s safety online, we introduced Password Checkup. It's a new feature that tells users if any of their passwords are weak, if they've been reused across multiple sites, or if they've been compromised somewhere on the web.","Now, moving on to how we are helping advertisers. We are bringing our strengths in machine learning to help advertisers build their ad campaigns. Machine learning power tools like search auto bidding are gaining traction. In fact, more than half of advertisers\u2019 search spend is now optimized via full auto bidding. We now have more than 1 million advertisers using responsive search apps, and ad format, we launched a year ago that uses machine learning to create the right ad for each search queries. And our new Video Reach campaigns allow marketers to upload multiple video ads into a single campaign. From there, we use machine learning to serve the most efficient combination of these ads to help brands reach audiences at scale.","This quarter, we expanded inventory for our very popular App Campaigns to include new services, including YouTube search, display video ads and the Discover feed. We also launched YouTube masthead ads for TV, which enable advertisers to reach audiences right when they open the YouTube app on their connected TVs, one of its fastest-growing screens.","It's also important for advertisers to have standardized measurement that\u2019s fair across all media and that delivers insights in a way that fully protects user\u2019s privacy. We are making it easier for businesses to do just that. Our next generation of Google Analytics unifies web and app measurement reporting for the first time to help businesses understand which channel is driving the best result.","On a personal note, I was in Dallas in October, there I saw firsthand how important Google is in helping small and medium-sized businesses grow. I got to visit Peacock Alley a bedding and bath manufacturer in Dallas with 75 employees. They\u2019ve been using Google ads for over 15 years to help drive traffic to their stores. Their ecommerce has grown 52% in the past year. They credit the guidance Google Analytics provides as well as Google Shopping and Product Listing Ads for that growth.","This isn't the only way we help small businesses grow and thrive. Our Grow with Google program has helped train 3 million Americans in digital skills, including small business owners and entrepreneurs. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that our IT professional support certificate training course will expand to 100 community colleges. It's already helped tens of thousands of people pursue fast-growing, well-paying careers in IT support. I\u2019m glad to see more community colleges offer this pathway to students.","Finally, to round out a busy quarter. Sustainability has always been a core value for us. And I'm proud that we have been carbon neutral since 2007. In September, we announced the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history. We are increasing Google\u2019s existing renewable energy portfolio by more than 40%. These purchases are happening globally, spurring the construction of more than $2 billion in new energy infrastructure including millions of solar panels and hundreds of wind turbines across three continents.","And at our hardware event, we announced that we're committing to roughly $150 million in renewable energy projects in key manufacturing regions. Our hope is that this will spur even greater investments in sustainability.","So, it's been a really great quarter. A personal highlight for me was our Take Our Parents to Work Day, which we held in September at our main campus in Mountain View. It was great to see thousands of parents take such pride in what their kids are building. I feel the same way. None of our work would be possible without our Googlers around the world. This quarter was another great example of the mission that brings us all together. Thank you. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you, Sundar.","In the third quarter, total revenues of $40.5 billion were up 20% year-on-year and up 22% in constant currency. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search, YouTube and Cloud.","I will begin with the review of the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google, followed by other Bets and conclude with our outlook. Sundar and I will then take your questions.","Details of Alphabet\u2019s consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings press release.","Regarding our key expense lines, on a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I will discuss in the Google segment, was $17.6 billion, up 23% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $10.1 billion, up 31% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. The biggest contributor again this quarter was costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube and mostly for our advertising supported content, but also for our newer subscription businesses, YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues. This line also includes the impact of hardware costs, primarily associated with our mid-tier Pixel 3a smartphones.","Operating expenses were $13.8 billion, with headcount growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for both R&D and sales and marketing, which is reflected in both compensation and facilities expenses.","With respect to R&D, the growth was again driven by the addition of engineering talent, consistent with our focus on product innovation. The increase in G&A year-over-year was primarily due to a $554 million charged from our previously announced legal settlements in France.","Stock-based compensation totaled $2.6 billion. Headcount was up 6,450 from the second quarter. And consistent with prior quarters, the majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable headcount increases were again in cloud for both technical and sales roles. Operating income was $9.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year for an operating margin up 23%.","Other income and expense was a loss of $549 million, which primarily reflects the impact of unrealized losses and marketable equity securities. As of September 30, the unrealized equity gain in the combined portfolio of marketable and nonmarketable securities was $5.8 billion. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Net income was $7.1 billion and earnings per diluted share were $10.12.","Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $6.7 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results. Operating cash flow was $15.5 billion with free cash flow of $8.7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $121 billion.","Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $40.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $28.6 billion in the quarter, up 19% year-over-year. In terms of dollar growth, results were led again by mobile search with a strong contribution from YouTube followed by desktop search. ","Network revenues were $5.3 billion, up 8% year-on-year, continuing to reflect the performance as a primary drivers of growth within network, namely, Google Ad manager followed by AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $6.4 billion, up 39% year-over-year, once again fueled by Cloud, followed by a strong performance from Play. Within Cloud growth in GCP was once again the primary driver of performance with strong customer demand for our compute and data analytics products, complemented by ongoing growth in G Suite, reflecting both new pricing and seat growth.","Within Play, performance was driven once again by growth in the number of active buyers. In addition, the line reflects hardware, which continued to benefit from the launch of our Pixel 3a mid-tier smartphones.","We provide monetization metrics in our earnings press release to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $7.5 billion or 22% of total advertising revenues and up 14% year-over-year. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was down year-over-year, reflecting primarily a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites.","The sites TAC rate increased year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC partially offset by the growth in TAC-free sites revenues, primarily from YouTube. In Q3, the network TAC rate declined year-on-year, primarily due to a favorable product mix shift.","Google operating income was $10.9 billion, up 14% versus last year and the operating margin was 26.9%. Google accrued CapEx for the quarter was $7.2 billion, reflecting investments in office facilities and data centers, followed by servers. Investments in office facilities included the $1 billion acquisition of a portfolio of buildings in Sunnyvale, and the purchase of two buildings to expand our presence in the Seattle area.","Moving on to the performance of Other Bets. Revenues were $155 million, primarily generated by Fiber and Verily. Other Bets had an operating loss of $941 million. I'll note a couple of key accomplishments in Other Bets. At Waymo, we're extending fully driverless opportunities on a small scale to participants in our early rider program in Metro Phoenix. We're also testing long-haul truck driving on Arizona freeways. And we're continuing to test Waymo vehicles in various geographies, the newest of which is heavy rain testing in southern Florida. In addition, we have begun 3D mapping in Los Angeles.","And two weeks ago, Wing launched its first commercial drone delivery service to homes in Virginia in partnership with FedEx, Walgreens, and local Virginia retailer Sugar Magnolia. Wing is now operating on three continents in early test deliveries.","I will sum up with a few observations on the quarter and our longer term outlook. Based on the strength of the U.S. dollar today relative to the fourth quarter of last year, we expect continued FX headwinds again in the fourth quarter of 2019. As a reminder, foreign exchange headwinds affect both revenues and operating income, given the majority of our expenses are in the U.S.","With respect to revenues, we're pleased with the performance of our advertising business. As a reminder, there is variability in year-over-year revenue growth rates from quarter-to-quarter. As we\u2019ve often discussed, we manage our business for the long term and not on a quarterly basis, and we remain very-focused on continuing to enhance the experience for users and advertisers over the long term. Within other revenues, in addition to continued strength in compute, Google Cloud saw substantial growth from data analytics as customers are seeing the benefits from implementing BigQuery. Cloud continued to see significant growth in each region globally.","Our new lineup of Made by Google hardware was announced two weeks ago with pixel 4 hitting store shelf late last week. With the introduction of the Pixel 3a in the second quarter, we expect the seasonality of our hardware business to be moderated somewhat.","Turning to elements of our profitability. With regard to Google operating expenses. While headcount growth on an absolute basis in the third quarter was usually high, reflecting the addition of new college hires, we do remain on pace for headcount growth in 2019 to be in line with growth in 2018. Our investments in talent support innovation across our businesses and in particular support our ongoing momentum in cloud.","Regarding sales and marketing expenses, as I\u2019ve mentioned on prior calls, these expenses are typically more heavily weighted toward the back half of the year and tend to be particularly elevated in the fourth quarter to support the holiday season. In Other Bets, we continue to invest meaningfully and thoughtfully for the long-term opportunities that we see.","Turning to capital allocation and CapEx. With respect to capital returns, consistent with announcing an increase in our stock buyback authorization last quarter to $25 billion, we were pleased to step up repurchase levels by nearly 60% to $5.7 billion in the third quarter. In terms of CapEx, as a reminder, over the last couple of years, the split between technical infrastructure and office facilities has averaged approximately 70% to 30%. Due to the sizable purchases of office facilities we made in Q3, technical infrastructure accounted for only about 60% of total CapEx and continued to be more heavily weighted to data center construction and servers.","Looking forward, we anticipate the primary driver of CapEx investment will continue to be our expected compute requirements, particularly to support ongoing demand for machine learning across our business as well as for Cloud, Search and YouTube. At this scale of investment, we remain very-focused on driving efficiency through fleet optimization and tight management of our supply chain.","In conclusion, we remain confident about the opportunities ahead. Sundar and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I can. First, Sundar, big picture question. It feels like the concept of the ambient computing was sort of prevalent at the Made by Google event recently. It started with sort of a bit of a shift in theme, what I could tell at Google I\/O earlier this year. Can you just talk about what some of the key investments you want to make to capitalize on that opportunity into long-term? How you think Google and maybe broader Alphabet is positioned to capitalize on that? How it might show up at the product services layer? So, I guess, maybe a three-part question, more of a bigger picture nature.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Eric. We are very excited by the vision of ambient computing and evolving that. I think, it's a continuity in the sense that over time computing should be more intuitive to users and computing should adapt to users, not the other way around. And the foundations of all of this is all the work we have done with our computing platforms till date and under successful consumer services and developer platforms we have built. And I think that's the most of the investments there. The phones will continue to be at the center of ambient computing for the future. So, that's another important piece where we are already invested in.","I think, as we expand beyond and that's what the Made by Google family is focused on, products in your home with our Nest family of products, and wearables which we do with Wear OS and so on. So, supporting that ecosystem, so whether you're at home or on the go or at work, and making sure it works.","Our investments in the AI across the Company, I think, will end up playing a key role, AI and Assistant. I think, they'll be at the center of making sure we can anticipate what users want and serve them better.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Doug Anmuth","Sundar, you talked about the new neural network techniques talking about the biggest breakthrough in Search in years. Could you just help us understand if that\u2019s impacting kind of the advertising and monetization side of the business yet or how that can play out going forward?","Sundar Pichai","Anytime -- maybe I\u2019ll answer it, as BERT, which is the name of the technique we're using, and we\u2019ve rolled it out in Search now. And obviously, anytime we can better make sense of queries, we can serve users better, our search quality goes up, and people engage and that\u2019s -- engage more. So, it's part of a long run sort of things we've been working on, but this is one of our bigger breakthroughs in terms of helping improve the search experience and search quality. And remember, it will help us in a certain set of queries. There are many queries which we\u2019re already working well, but it helps us capture nuance and help understand human context better. And so, I would just characterize this as a big improvement, which improves search quality and creates that virtuous cycle by which people engage more.","Of course, a lot of times, we take the same techniques, and sometimes it makes sense on the app side, and down the line, machine learning techniques. And we'll deploy it there as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","I just wanted to follow up on a couple of the comments you made about Cloud, Sundar. I was wondering if you could just give us some color on the size of your GCP backlog. And maybe even if you just talk about the trajectory, and how that's changed over the course of the last year? And then, you mentioned the strength and the uptake of BigQuery, I'm just trying to think through how we should think of the margin, level of a service like this versus the traditional compute offerings where you've seen strength to date. And just wondering, if we start to see some positive mix shifts benefits, as some of these premium products start to start to ramp more aggressively? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Heather. Overall, I know, we gave some visibility into our cloud business and we'll continue to do that periodically. And the momentum has been great. Obviously, ever since Thomas has come in, he has continued to invest across the board. He\u2019s definitely focused a lot on scaling up our sales partner and operational teams. And, it's playing out well. In this business, it's important for you to be in as many deal situations as possible and get those wins, which accrues over time. And so, we are definitely seeing the momentum.","Analytics is a huge area of strength for us. And it's an area, which Thomas has a lot of expertise in as well. And BigQuery is such a strong product, so it's a natural area, we are seeing strength. And my sense is, as we get -- if I look at the TAM, the percentage of TAM for which we were eligible, compared to two years ago to last year to now, that number is shifting aggressively due to either completing our product feature set or be completing some of the certifications we need. And so, I think, there are several strong forward-looking indicators and look forward to sharing more at the right time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney","Can I just ask you to draw a little bit more out on Google Maps? I know that\u2019s for marketing earlier in the year that that seems like that's now at a stage where it's going to be better integrated into the -- I don't know, the purchase path or whatever, you're making it easier for small businesses to tap into what should be really nicely qualified leads. Just talk about the pace at which that -- the monetization of that or just the ad opportunities will be offered to small businesses? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","In general, local is an important area for us, and we are continuing to invest in building experience that connects merchants, advertisers and users. Google My Business has been our major effort there. Today millions of businesses are -- reach and engage, both through Search and Maps. Specifically, in GML, we announced that we\u2019ll expand local campaigns. I presume that's what you're talking about. It's still early. And in general, we want to make it easier for advertisers, particularly SMBs to come to Google and be able to reach users across our set of owned and operated properties. So, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Discover, be it Maps, and that's the way we envision that. But, small and medium business is a big area of focus and maps represents a big, long-term opportunity for us.","Ruth Porat","And just to add on there, given you referenced back to GML, and I think we talked about this last quarter as well. Our view is that the products that were introduced to GML, this year, like in previous years, they're rolled out in phases, they're adopted over time. And so, we don't view the potential impact from this year's slate differently than the impact from products that were launched at previous events, and so just to kind of keep that in perspective.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. ","Lloyd Walmsley","I wanted to ask another one about new product you guys announced earlier this year at GML. And that was really Google Shopping and moving that across some of the new different properties like YouTube and Image Search and Discover. Can you give us a sense for where you are in that migration, kind of over what timeframe should we be thinking about that? And then, maybe just elaborate a bit on the long-term vision of moving shopping functionality into properties like YouTube and how you think that experience will evolve? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai","In general, I think it\u2019s paid opportunity for us. We see tons of what I would call commercial user journeys across Google. Obviously Search is an important area, Image Search, YouTube, Maps all great surfaces by which I think users come with varying degrees of commercial interest, looking to discover and at times transact as well. So, we\u2019ve started thinking much more holistically about what are those experiences and how can we make it better. That involves helping improve the Discovery experience, but when people are interested in it, being able to make it easier to transact. So, the equivalent of being signed and being able to pay when you want and then of course the fulfillment and logistics. So, we're thinking through the end to end experience across all our surfaces and are investing. But, I see the user interest, and it\u2019s an area that I think we have significant opportunities ahead.","Ruth Porat","And again, these are still earlier stage and it\u2019s -- we\u2019re excited about the longer term impact. But, just again make it clear we\u2019re just still in the earlier stages of testing. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Brian Nowak","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Ruth, I think you mentioned the Desktop Search might have been one of the contributors of growth. Can you just talk to us little bit about what types of products or verticals you\u2019re still seeing growth? I know desktop search really impressive, given how long has this been around. And then, Sundar, with all the exciting changes going on with search become more relevant et cetera. Can you just talk about some of the KPIs that you monitor or what you're seeing when it comes to query volumes, click through rate, overall response time, what are you seeing that sort of gives you confidence that you\u2019ll continue to get more and more relevant results for your users? Thanks. ","Ruth Porat","So, in terms of desktop, I described it as a solid contributor to revenue growth. And what we see is that desktop does remain an important form factor for certain more complex tasks. So, things like planning vacations or assessing insurance options, what we see is users continue to go back to desktop, notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile. And I think one of the things that we\u2019ve been very focused on is that innovations that benefit mobile also enhance the desktop experience for users and advertisers.","Sundar Pichai","And then, in terms of -- obviously, we\u2019ve been -- over time, we've developed very comprehensive metric for measuring and tracking search -- search quality -- to get a sense of such quality and how user satisfaction is through search. But, to give you a sense of -- we continue to take that work deeper, we realize users sometimes do searches through sessions understanding what is their satisfaction across the session, what is their engagement, are they getting at what they are looking for? Those are all some of the deeper work we are undertaking, and also understanding by vertical how we are helping users. There was an earlier question around shopping and commerce. That's an example of the kind of vertical and what can we do to make that experience better. Health is another vertical in which we have a whole Google Health team focused on understanding the in-depth experience that would give better experience overall in search. So, very comprehensive effort and we are constantly looking to do it deeper and broader at the same time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Your line is now open.","Colin Sebastian","I have two. Sundar, there's clearly a lot of innovation happening at Google. But, I'm wondering how do you think about the increase in scrutiny and oversight possibly impacting your ability to explore new services or new markets over time, and ultimately to remain competitive? And second, Sundar or Ruth, we don't often ask about the display network, but just wondering, given all the concerns around privacy, ad blocking and the like, how do you view this business strategically, as part of the overall ecosystem?","Sundar Pichai","On the first part, we consistently want to work and build products that benefit users and support the ecosystem. And so, our products and services benefit consumers, small and medium businesses, advertisers, and overall, they help reduce prices and expand choice. And so, that's our underlying approach, I think, which is what helps us engage and explain to regulators and we\u2019ll continue to do that. I think, there are also many new areas of opportunities available for us, and in many of these areas we are the new entrant and we create competition. And sometimes the competitive pressures can lead to concerns from others. And so, that's part of what's going on as well. But, the other area is, in addition to developed markets, we are investing deeply in our next billion users. So, markets like APAC continue to be bit long term opportunities for us as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays.","Ross Sandler","Ruth, just, if you rewind the clock a little bit, when we entered this year, you had called out how some product changes may cause year-over-year growth rates to fluctuate from time to time. And we haven't heard that in a couple of quarters. So, as we look out towards like 2020 and beyond, do you feel like a lot of the product queue is in a good place, as far as Search and YouTube are concerned, and that these product changes might be a little bit more subtle going forward, or could we return to having more meaningful impact in the future, just any color there? And then, on the third quarter, the Asia region, the growth rate was solid but a tad lower than the prior trend. So, anything notable to call out on APAC?","Ruth Porat","So, in terms of the first question, I think, as Sundar and I talked about, we're pleased with the strength of the business that you've seen here again in the third quarter. And as we said, since the IPO, we don't manage the business to maximize quarterly results and we'll always do the right thing for the long term. We're very focused on investing for the long term. And I tried to make it clear in opening comments that as a result, quarterly growth can vary and has varied. And I think to your question, our view is that quarterly growth around the rates you've seen since the beginning of the year, for us underscore the strength and the vibrancy actually in our business. And that's particularly true at our size, in the last 12 months we've generated over $150 billion in total revenues. That's about $25 billion of growth in the last year. And we are continuing to invest in long-term opportunities. But, I would make the point that we do keep a lens to the long-term. In terms of your question about geographies.","When we look at the performance on a fixed FX basis around the globe, pleased with the performance again in the third quarter. You aptly point out, year-on-year growth in APAC in the third quarter was a bit lower than the second quarter. That primarily reflected slower growth in the network business, and that was in part due to policy changes. It also reflected the fact that the launch of the Pixel 3a was in the second quarter, which boosted the year-on-year growth rate in the second quarter. But, I think also implicit in your question, at 26% year-on-year growth on a fixed FX basis, running it about now $7 billion in quarterly revenues, we\u2019re really pleased with all what the team is doing and the year-on-year growth rate.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets.","Dan Salmon","Sundar, maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on the Discover feed. That's a new product that we featured in the past that I know a lot of users are getting more use out of. You gave us I think some updates on monthly active users or DA use in the past. Any update there would be great or maybe any additional color on sort of how the total amounts of usage goes on there, that's obviously been featured to users a little bit more.","And then, second, maybe just a follow-up for Ruth. Sundar spoke at length about your investments in renewable energy earlier and maybe keeping with the theme of the earnings call, you could help us understand how that is or maybe is not helping drive efficiencies across the country -- across the Company and your operating costs overall? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai ","Discover is the product we are very excited about. I think, it completes the other half of Search. Search is, we do our mission for our users and be helpful when they come to us looking for information, Discover is the other half where we are proactively understanding what might be most helpful or relevant to them and getting it to them. And we definitely are focused on product quality and making sure the product is actually helpful to users, and when they engage with it, they find it useful. And it's definitely we are making progress. Our investments and machine learning are helping us well. We are definitely able to better anticipate and give them information proactively.","So, over time, I see it as important area for us. And it's done and close. It's part of our search and knowledge efforts. And as we do that, you can imagine, you may have started a query in Search, and it's a session, maybe you're looking to take a trip somewhere, or you're researching a particular topic, we may be able to continue that discussion on the user journey in Discover, and that creates a virtuous cycle. So, these are -- we want to be helpful to users in a way that makes sense for them, more continually, and the combination of Search and Discover helps us do that.","Ruth Porat","And in terms of your question on sustainability, we're proud of the work that we're doing. We do think that it\u2019s a valuable part of what we do, and we do consider the impact on the business and on the financials. It really cuts across every element of what we do, what we\u2019re doing in our technical infrastructure, the way we\u2019re thinking about our products that Sundar talked about, what we're doing with our facilities, what we're doing with AI. And I think it was about a year ago we talked about how we were applying machine learning to energy efficiency in our data centers, and it did have a net benefit. It helped us reduce energy consumption, not only positive for sustainability but was an efficiency effort. Sundar talked about the fact that we are investing -- recently announced that we are purchasing, making an equal investment in renewable energy, part of our commitment to offset 100% of our electricity use with renewable. And in our view this is catalyzing further investment in renewable. That is going to have a modest short-term increase in cost. But, we think it\u2019s beneficial to catalyzing the overall growth in traditional energy. So, there are puts and takes and that we're proud of the work across everything that we are doing to support sustainability.","Operator","And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Stephen Ju","So, Sundar, I was wondering if you can put the quantum computing investment into some sort of perspective. Compute needs for Google have to be exponentially higher versus when you first launched. So, we\u2019re wondering if this helps you get your arms around that ever-increasing compute need. And further, I think you\u2019ll find that investors are as impatient as you guys are for progress. So, can you talk about what kind of products or services this will help you create that you other couldn\u2019t even think about doing before? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai","I\u2019m incredibly proud of the work that the team did and excited about the advancement in the whole industry. I think, in general, obviously, we\u2019ve relied on advances in computing to be able to do what we do. And when we look ahead, we definitely see being able to drive the pace of change here fastest is an important need for us as well as I think source of competitive advantage. As Moore\u2019s Law effects have diminished, I think, we are looking at variety of approach to make sure we can continue doing what we need to. And in that this is an important tool into arsenal. While quantum will take many years to really start making a difference, we want to be at the cutting edge of driving it. I don\u2019t think over time for sure, cloud itself, we do see a lot of interest from cloud customers, particularly in cutting-edge verticals about quantum computing. And so, that's an area where I think we\u2019ll participate in as a business, and more importantly applying it across other verticals we are in, be it health, as an example, I think we will be where we will deliver value in the long run.","Ruth Porat","And as much as we're extremely excited about the long-term implications for quantum computing, part of your question there about our near term computing requirements. Given our outlook in particular across Google, we do expect to see ongoing demand for compute investments to support our growth, particularly for machine learning, Cloud, Search and YouTube. And the primary driver of the CapEx does continue to be our expectations for compute requirements, so investments in technical infrastructure, as we've talked about today.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brent Thill","Thanks. I need a Google headset. Sundar, just on investments in GCP, you're in a really unique situation, having built infrastructure and productivity applications. Can you just walk through how you prioritize the two big buckets? There's a lot of different ways you can go in GCP. And just want to follow up with Ruth. You alluded to some G Suite pricing changes. And I know there were some prices that were changed earlier in the year. And I was just curious if you were referring to that price change or earlier in the year or if there was something new?","Sundar Pichai","I mean, you're right. I mean, these are two big buckets and we treat them that way. Obviously, we've talked a lot about GCP, but G Suite continues to be very differentiated. And, we just announced a new leader Javier Soltero coming in with lots of experience to turbo-charge this area as well.","And in general, there are many G Suite customers now with who we are having GCP conversations and vice versa. So, I think in general, given we have a big go-to-market effort, the breadth you have allows us to have more conversations and engage through many different paths into the organization. So, it's very synergistic as well.","Ruth Porat","And in terms of the G Suite pricing, I was referencing the pricing that we announced back in April. It's all outlined in a blog post. Our view was, it was the right time to increase prices, given the ongoing functionality and tools that are included within G Suite. And as I said, what we're seeing here is in addition to the benefit from the price change. We also continue to have nice seat growth.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Justin Post","I think I\u2019ll ask on YouTube, could you talk a little bit about your high level OTT viewing strategy? Obviously, subscriptions are growing. Maybe give us an update on how your YouTube subscription product is doing versus expectations? And then, on the paid click growth, it decelerated 18%, anything to call out there, especially related to YouTube, any change to coverage going on or anything we should know about? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","Subscription is an area we are different definitely excited about. We are pleased with our options so far across both, YouTube Music and YouTube Premium. They're now available in 71 countries from five markets at the start of 2018. So, we are definitely scaling that up and we're seeing great traction. YouTube TV is also doing well. I think, we just announced that PBS is coming to YouTube TV in July. Last month, we announced YouTube TV is now launching on select Amazon Fire TV devices. So, there's definite -- the user satisfaction on the product is high. And so, we are focused on continuing our expansion, building out a great service and building awareness for the service. So, overall, I think, engaging users with premium offerings on YouTube is the focus for us. And the efforts, while early, are definitely showing strong traction.","Ruth Porat","And then, you asked about click growth and the trend there, the biggest driver affecting the click trends continues to be the growth of YouTube engagement ads. As in the first and second quarter, the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated in the third quarter. That does continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the user and advertiser experience. And as we've talked about on prior calls, that did have an impact on click growth. But as we also talked about, they weren't related to those changes in 2018. We're not related to policy enforcement actions that YouTube, they had a negligible impact on YouTube revenues. So, not a read through.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks.","Ellen West","Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Thank you again and have a good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."],"1485":["Alphabet, Inc.

Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ellen West, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen West - Alphabet, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. While you were waiting, you were listening to the infectious song \"Diggy,\" by Spencer Ludwig. Spencer is a new, exciting artist on Warner Bros. Records who is touring Europe this month. You have heard his trumpet stylings when he performed with Capital Cities on \"Safe and Sound.\" Be sure to check out his official \"Diggy\" video on his YouTube channel.","Now I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K for 2016, filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make are based on assumption as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them.","During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz\/investor. This call is also being webcast from our IR website, where a replay of the call will be available later today.","And now I'll turn the call over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Thank you, Ellen. Our revenues of $24.8 billion in the first quarter demonstrate our broad-based strength globally, with revenues up 22% year on year. In constant currency, our consolidated revenues grew 24% versus 1Q 2016. Growth in advertising revenues was again driven by mobile search, with ongoing strength in YouTube and programmatic. We also had substantial growth in other revenues from Play, hardware, and Cloud.","Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet. Given the obvious seasonality in Q4, I will focus on year-over-year changes in our results. As a reminder, I will review our results on a GAAP basis, which includes stock-based compensation for operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Second, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss our business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take questions.","Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $24.8 billion, up 22% year over year. We realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $304 million or $87 million after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 24% year over year.","Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography, as you can see in our press release, we've enhanced the geographic split to give you more insight into our businesses around the world. We are now reporting our revenues in four regions: the U.S., EMEA \u2013 namely Europe, Middle East, and Africa \u2013 APAC or Asia Pacific, and Other Americas, which encompasses Canada and Latin America. To help you with the transition to our new geographic reporting, we're also sharing the U.K. revenues for this quarter. These groupings align more closely with how we manage our businesses and also with the major currencies that affect our results.","The results by region highlight the strength of our business around the globe. U.S. revenues were up 25% year over year to $11.8 billion. EMEA revenues were $8.1 billion, up 13% year over year. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 19%. U.K.-reported revenues continue to reflect the ongoing weakness of the British pound, with revenues up 5% year over year to $2 billion on a reported basis, yet up 16% in fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $3.6 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 26% in fixed FX terms, reflecting strength of the Australian dollar and yen. Other Americas revenues, which include results from Canada and Latin America, were up 34% versus last year to $1.3 billion. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 29% year over year, with fixed FX growth reflecting strength in the Brazilian real.","On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $9.8 billion, up 28% year on year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.2 billion, up 34% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses \u2013 specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, and content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, as well as hardware-related costs reflecting the continued strong performance of our new Made by Google product line. Operating expenses were $8.4 billion in the quarter, up 15% year over year.","Year-on-year comparisons in part reflect the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle, with a half-year grant in Q1, which enables us to move to a single annual compensation cycle. As discussed last quarter, this affects the timing of stock-based compensation but does not affect the overall size of the SBC expense for the year. The year-on-year increase is therefore more sizable in Q1 and Q2 compared to previous years, with less of a year-on-year impact in both Q3 and Q4. More specifically, stock-based compensation totaled $2 billion, up 34% year over year.","Headcount at the end of the quarter was 73,992, up 1,939 people from last quarter. The growth in consolidated head count was somewhat muted by an internal reallocation of people from Fiber to Google. Consistent with prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count growth was in Cloud, consistent with the priority we place on this business.","Operating income was $6.6 billion, up 23% versus last year. The operating margin was 27%. Other income and expense was $251 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 20% for the first quarter. Net income was $5.4 billion, and earnings per diluted share were $7.73.","Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $2.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.5 billion, with free cash flow of $7 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $92.4 billion, of which approximately $55.7 billion or 60% is held overseas.","Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $24.5 billion, up 22% year over year, which includes the impact of FX. In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenues were $17.4 billion in the quarter, up 21% year over year. The biggest contributor to growth again this quarter was mobile search, reflecting the secular shift to mobile due to the greater utility of smartphones for users and advertisers, but obviously also benefiting from our focus on continuously enhancing features and functionality. YouTube revenues continue to grow at a significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising. Network revenues were $4 billion, up 9% year on year, reflecting the ongoing strong growth of programmatic and AdMob. Results benefited from a slower rate of decline in the traditional Network business than in prior periods, although it continues to be negatively affected by both the ongoing shift by advertisers to programmatic and our ongoing policy efforts. Other revenues for Google were $3.1 billion, up 49%.","Last quarter we talked about our bigger investment areas, and you can see the strong momentum here, reflecting contributions from each of Play, hardware, and Cloud. Specifically, Play benefited from both broad-based app strength but also from all the work we have done in areas such as direct carrier billing, which helps more people globally access and buy their favorite apps and games on Google Play. Hardware continues to have strong growth and remains an important area for us, with our family of products extending geographically. Google Cloud continues to drive sizable growth, with Google Cloud Platform remaining one of the fastest-growing businesses across Alphabet. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.","Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.6 billion, or 22% of total advertising revenues, and up 22% year over year. The increase in both Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenues, as well as Network TAC as a percentage of Network revenues, reflects the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC. Total TAC as a percentage of total advertising revenues was up year over year as a result of an increase in the Sites TAC rate, driven by the shift to mobile, which was again partially offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from Network to Sites, which carries lower TAC.","Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 40% year over year. Operating income, including the impact of SBC, was $7.6 billion, up 22% versus last year, and the operating margin was 31%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.","Turning to Other Bets. For the first quarter, Other Bets revenues were $244 million, primarily generated by Nest, Verily, and Fiber. Operating loss, including the impact of SBC, was $855 million for the first quarter. Other Bets accrued CapEx was $170 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q 2016.","Let me conclude. First, we've benefited from our team's innovations that continually enhance our advertising business, as evidenced by the ongoing growth of Sites revenues. On a dollar basis, the increase in Sites revenues reflects the healthy growth in mobile search. As we discussed in prior calls, even though mobile revenue growth requires an increasing investment in the mobile ecosystem in the form of higher TAC, our strength in mobile search is adding meaningfully to profit dollars.","Second, the strong performance in our advertising business allows us to take bigger bets within Google to fuel the growth of additional revenue streams, including those from Cloud, hardware, and YouTube subscription offerings. Cloud is one of our most important strategic priorities given the scale of opportunity in a rapidly evolving sector and the fact that the requirements for success align with many of our strengths. We will continue to invest here for the long-term opportunity. Similarly, hardware remains an exciting growth opportunity for us, and you've seen the early indicators again this quarter.","Finally in Other Bets, we're determining the size and pace of investment appropriate to each bet, given their stage of development and achievements against milestones. We expect to increase near-term investment in certain areas while continuing to calibrate the pace of investment in others as they move along a path to commercialization. For example, as I hope you saw earlier this week, Waymo announced it has commenced a trial of its self-driving cars in the Phoenix area. Waymo also announced it is expanding its fleet of minivans to support this trial. These actions reflect the tremendous accomplishment of our team over many years, leading with safety, and now beginning to bring the experience to consumers.","I will now turn the call over to Sundar.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Thanks, Ruth. It's been a terrific start to the year. This quarter was notable for the fantastic momentum across our products. Advances for the Google Assistant, the launch of YouTube TV, and lots of new features launched at our Google Cloud Next event. In the next few weeks, there's much more to come. We'll host our annual developer conference, Google I\/O; our advertising event, Google Marketing Next; and our YouTube upfront, Brandcast. I hope you'll join us.","Today I'll discuss three things. First, how our continued investments in machine learning are fueling innovation across Google, and particularly how it's helping drive our core mission of providing access to information for everyone. Second, progress in three of our biggest bets: YouTube, Cloud, and hardware. And, third, our platforms, such as Android and our advertising platform, which power businesses and computing experiences around the world.","Now, turning first to machine learning and access to information. I'm really happy with how we are transitioning to an AI-first company. The Google Assistant is one of our first steps towards that future. This quarter, we brought the Assistant to your wrist with Android Wear 2.0, announced that it'll soon come to Android TV, and began rolling it out to hundreds of millions of people with Android phones running Nougat and Marshmallow. We also continue to announce new integration partners for the Google Assistant, so you can now ask it to do things like dim the living room lights. Stay tuned for more to come.","Advances in machine learning are helping us make many Google products better. One example from this quarter is the launch of parking predictions in Google Maps. Beyond that, we continue to set the pace in machine learning and AI research. We introduced a new technique for training deep neural networks on mobile devices called Federated Learning. This technique enables people to run a shared machine learning model while keeping their underlying data stored locally on mobile phones. DeepMind is bringing AlphaGo to China in May, pairing AI with the world's best players at the Future of Go Summit. And it's very exciting to see the incredible things that developers and researchers are building on the TensorFlow platform. There are more than 6,000 GitHub projects and counting.","Search remains at the heart of our mission to make information available to everyone, and we are laser-focused on making Search even better. In March, we introduced tappable shortcuts in Google Search to help you easily access topics you care about, like sports, entertainment, and weather. And, earlier this week, to improve our results further, we introduced algorithmic ranking improvements, as well as easier ways for people to provide better (17:28) feedback in autocomplete and Featured Snippets. Last week, we made big improvements to one of our longest-standing and most loved products, Google Earth. It's really beautiful and easy to use. Now you can experience breathtaking locations in virtual reality, like the top of Table Mountain in South Africa.","Moving on to three of our biggest bets: YouTube, Cloud, and hardware. First, YouTube, where we continue to see extraordinary growth and opportunities. People around the world are watching more content on YouTube than ever before. In 2016, we passed a big milestone that continues to grow. Every day, users watch over a billion hours on YouTube. YouTube continues to be the most popular destination for online video globally, and we are focused on building awesome experiences.","This quarter we announced YouTube TV, which offers live TV from major broadcast and cable networks, a cloud-based DVR without storage limits, and streaming on all of your devices. We have launched in five cities so far, and the positive feedback from customers has been really incredible. Our destination for family and kids' content, called YouTube Kids, also recently celebrated its second birthday. There have been more than 30 billion video views in the app to date.","Next, our growing Cloud business. Our Google Cloud Next conference in March was a great opportunity to highlight core areas of differentiation for GCP, like new security products and the recognition that we had the highest cloud availability in 2016, according to CloudHarmony. It was attended by five times as many people as last year. We also demonstrated new machine learning services and announced our acquisition of Kaggle, the largest community of data centers focused on machine learning and AI. We introduced dozens of new products, including Spanner, a database optimized for distributed computing that can reliably update data across multiple data centers. And our G Suite team introduced a major expansion of or collaboration platform with Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. To give you a taste of the kinds of large enterprise customers and partners we are now working with across GCP, we were joined on stage by major companies like HSBC, Home Depot, Schlumberger, and SAP, as well as large G Suite customers, including Colgate-Palmolive.","We continue to see tremendous momentum in education, where our products are leading the industry, thanks to their simplicity, security, and low cost. Chromebooks are now used by more than 20 million teachers and students, and more than 70 million people actively use G Suite for Education.","Over the last several months, we have noticed a change in the types of conversations that Diane and her team are having with customers. Increasingly, we are being asked to partner for mission-critical projects and full migrations, moving data from on-prem data centers to the cloud. We are seeing a meaningful shift, and this momentum is resulting in a fast-growing business.","On to our next big bet, hardware. Last year, we debuted a beautiful new family of hardware devices, including the Pixel, Google Home, and Google Wifi, bringing together the best of Google across hardware and software. We are finding that people who buy products like Pixel and Google Home are not only incredibly happy with their purchase but also very likely to recommend it to others. Sales continues to be strong, and we are actively working to bring these great devices to more people around the world. Just a few weeks ago, we announced that Google Home and Google Wifi are now available in the U.K. Speaking of Google Home, last week we made it possible for up to six people to connect their accounts to one Google Home, and thanks to a leading voice recognition technology, it can recognize who's speaking to it. It's really a game changer.","And, finally, we are continuing to invest in our computing and advertising platforms. Our platforms have had great success over the years, creating incredible user experiences, as well as real opportunities and economic success for partners, creators, and developers around the globe. To illustrate, in the past three years in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa alone, we paid out more than $15 billion to our publisher, creator, and app developer partners. That's across AdSense, YouTube, and Google Play, and it doesn't even include device sales by many hardware partners who build on Android. There's tremendous momentum in the Android ecosystem, as evidenced by the great reception of the beautiful Samsung Galaxy S8. We'll have much more to say at I\/O next month.","In March, we introduced the first developer preview of Android O, featuring improvements for battery life, notifications, and picture-in-picture display. The Android platform is also seeing great growth in emerging markets. In 2016, nearly 300 million new users adopted Android devices from countries like India and Brazil. We also announced the public launch of Android Wear 2.0, with two new flagship watches from LG. And thanks to partnerships with major brands like TAG and Fossil, there'll be more than 20 different Android Wear watches available this year, doubling the number from last year.","Our virtual reality platform Daydream, which debuted almost a year ago, continues to gain traction with more devices and more great content, like VR video. More than 50% of time in Daydream is video consumption, and YouTube VR is Daydream's number 1 app by time spent.","Lastly, I'll talk about the highlights and trends we are seeing across our growing advertising business, where there are still enormous opportunities. As you can see from our results, we continue to experience remarkable growth worldwide. Not only are existing advertisers choosing to spend more as they see the value of our ads, but many more businesses around the world are just getting started on our ad platforms, from India to Brazil and many more. Our momentum continues to be driven by the shift to mobile. Our great properties, like Search, Maps, YouTube, and Google Play, are the prime time for the mobile world, where people are actively engaged and interested.","We have increased our investment in machine learning in our advertising business, with efforts like Smart Bidding, where our systems predict the performance of an ad and adjust advertisers' bids in real time to maximize their results. Two areas where we are seeing particular strength are retailers and app developers. Mobile has transformed the shopping experience. In the past year, local shopping queries have increased by 45%, and the number of retailers that provide us with their local inventory feeds has doubled. Our investments in innovative ad formats, include targeting and better measurement, are really helping retailers, who see us as an ally in their corner. Brands like Williams-Sonoma have seen a 70% increase in mobile sales year over year, with Google mobile shopping ads playing a big part.","Secondly, developers use us to help their apps stand out from the crowd. Thanks to our app install advertising products, developers have already driven more than 5 billion app downloads. Our flagship product here, Universal App Campaigns, allows developers to easily promote their apps across Google Search, Play, YouTube, and the Google Display Network. It incorporates machine learning to improve campaigns and drive great results for advertisers. We recently announced new innovations at the Game Developers Conference, including an interactive playable ad format in Universal App Campaigns that lets users play a lightweight version of your game right in the ad. It's really effective in driving installs from engaged users.","Now on to our growing video advertising business. Brands love the reach and engagement that they get across YouTube, along with the effectiveness of formats like TrueView skippable ads and our new bumper ads, which are snackable six-second videos that drive incremental reach and frequency. We recently did research on more than 120 bumper ad campaigns, and the data showed that they drove a significant lift in brand awareness and ad recall. Under Armour used both bumper ads and TrueView together to promote a new product launch recently, resulting in double the lift in product interest among people who saw both ads compared to those who only saw the TrueView ad. We work incredibly hard to create the best environment for brands on YouTube. The cornerstone of our offering is Google Preferred, which allow brands to advertise against the top 5% of our content.","We also announced new safeguards for advertisers through a combination of updated ad policies and enforcement, new default settings around where ads can appear, improved controls for advertisers, and third-party brand safety reporting. Brands and agencies understand how hard we work to create the safest possible environment. We do this by also being very careful to ensure YouTube's innovative creators can earn money to support their unique and popular content. We've been actively engaged in conversations with clients about the new tools and controls we are providing, and we are having very productive discussions ahead of Brandcast next week.","Finally, programmatic advertising. As marketers continue to shift towards programmatic ad buying, our DoubleClick platform makes it easy for them to effectively reach the right audiences. We've been focusing on making more inventory available to more advertisers, especially premium inventory. For instance, we recently expanded our Programmatic Guaranteed reservation product to advertisers globally, and we made traditional TV inventory available to buy in DoubleClick Bid Manager.","So that's a run-through of some highlights for the quarter. Thanks to every Googler for making Google such an exciting and inspiring place to work every day. Over the last few days, we have had Take Your Child to Work Day at Google, which is one of my favorite events of the year. We have had thousands of excited, screaming kids running around the Googleplex, which is how I feel some days, too. What motivates us at Google is building the technologies that'll be central to all of their computing experiences, to give them opportunities to learn, to be heard, and to succeed.","And with that, I will hand it back over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Thank you, Sundar, and we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I had two. First, just, you talked about Cloud as a huge strategic priority. Could you just talk more about the go-to-market strategy for GCP and how you plan on building up the reseller channel there going forward? And then secondly, Sundar, on Waymo, I was curious on some of your thoughts. I know it's early, but on the timing for Waymo to become commercially viable. And then what are the key guideposts and requirements along the way? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","On the Cloud stuff, talking about go-to-market, as Ruth said in Q1, our largest growth in head count and CapEx was in Cloud. So we are thrilled with the progress we have made there since Diane arrived, building our world-class sales, marketing, and engineering teams. The heavy lifting, I would say, is around how we meet enterprises in the market. We have reorganized so we have one face to the customer. So it's not just sales reps. We've been thoughtful about how we have built out the entire go-to-market organization.","So we created two new areas that customers can now take advantage of. One is the office of the CTO, which helps customers solve difficult technical problems. And the second is our Advanced Solutions Lab, where customers can get help from machine learning experts. And on top of that, now we have a phenomenal support team that helps keeps customers' applications up and running. So I think what we have done \u2013 our approach is one Google. When a customer sings up for Google Cloud, they get more than GCP and G Suite. They have access to the ads and analytics teams, YouTube teams, and resources within our organization. So I think it's coming along quite well.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","And then on your question on Waymo, we view Waymo as a great example of a graduate from X that's addressing a sizable problem and builds off of tremendous technology here. We started with safety; we remain a leader in safety. And we continue to view that as the foundation for success. And at this point we're exploring many options enabling ridesharing, personal-use vehicles, logistics, and deliveries, and we also see opportunities to work with cities to address public transportation.","So the announcements that we made this week are a continuation of the progress the team has made. We do have a strong relationship with Fiat Chrysler, increased our car order, given the opportunity. They have been our primary partner to date, but to note we're in active discussions with others around the globe. And then I think, importantly, the trial in the Phoenix area is something that's been in the works for some time, and we do look forward for that trial. So it's still in the early days, and we're excited about the upside from Waymo.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you both.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. I also wanted to ask a question about Cloud as a follow-up. I was just wondering, Sundar, if you could share with us what's the feedback been since Next from your Cloud customers? And could you share with us how qualitatively \u2013 something so we can gauge just kind of whether this business is starting to see an inflection in growth or not? Is there anything you could give us qualitatively about how the pipeline is building in this area? And I guess just what I'm interested in is also the types of conversations you're having with customers now versus maybe six years ago. I'm sorry \u2013 six months ago. Sorry about that. Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Time flies fast. Next was \u2013 having done Google I\/O many, many times, I was surprised to see the scale and growth of Next from even last year to this year. We had five many times as people. I think everyone really appreciated seeing large customers, very sophisticated customers, like HSBC, eBay, Colgate-Palmolive, et cetera, discussing use of Google Cloud, GCP. Along with Diane, I did follow-up lunches with a set of people, and so the feedback has been very positive. People sense our commitment to the area. They understand the pace at which we are investing. They see that we are committed to machine learning and AI at a deep level. They appreciate how we are open-sourcing things. Facetalk was extraordinarily well-received. They are noticing the acquisitions we are making, Kaggle and AppBridge are a couple of acquisitions which happened around that time. So all that, all those details, I think clearly made an impact. I just spoke about the go-to-market progress, and I think that's beginning to get traction as well.","In general, I think there is a very strong recognition that we are have pivoted to being a deep enterprise company, and our conversations are very strategic. We are engaging at the highest levels within companies. And so, overall, I can see qualitative lead and momentum there. When we are in the middle of deals, we find we are very competitive, and there are areas where customers perceive us as best-in-class already. So it's been exciting to see.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, you mentioned Google Assistant in your remarks. Wanted to know, what have you seen in terms of consumer adoption of Google Assistant, whether at the Pixel level or the Google Home level? What does it give you in terms of sense of how people want to interact with the Assistant? What it might do in terms of putting artificial intelligence capabilities down to the consumer level and improve consumer experiences over the next couple years? Thanks so much for the color.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Good question, Eric. Pixel is a good example, because I think it's the place where we do the leading work here. And how we presented Google Assistant and the Pixel \u2013 well-received, both qualitatively in terms of consumer feedback we get, quantitatively in terms of how we see people using voice, how we see people interacting with overall Google Assistant and Search better. So we find that when we drive the Assistant experience well, it works overall in helping people engage with Google at a broader level.","It's always surprising to us \u2013 we always said, even with Search, every single day we see so many new types of queries. When you bring the assistant into the mix, you start getting even more different tips of queries, and queries are more casual, more conversational. And so over time I think it starts breaking down the barriers to computing people have, and that's what makes it very, very exciting.","Now, artificial intelligence will help us push all that further. Just to give an example, we will make text to speech much, much better over time. Yesterday, we announced our Neural Machine Translation is launching in nine new languages. So all that starts accruing to the Assistant, and I think we'll overall improve the customer experience pretty dramatically. We'll talk about all this a lot more at Google I\/O, so stay tuned.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks. Two questions, please. One on YouTube and one on Google Maps. Sundar or Ruth, there was some press about some of the pushback or some of the controversy around content and advertising and monetization of that. Are those technical problems that can be solved over time? Or is just the magnitude or the volume of content in trying to keep bad content off the site, however that's defined, and keep it from being monetized, is that an ongoing technology challenge or did you already find a solution? Then did you see any material impact to advertisers' budget interest with YouTube? And then if you could also comment briefly on Google Maps. This is one of those massive properties that you've owned that's highly used by almost everybody, and I think the monetization to date has been really de minimis. Is there anything that's changed for you in terms of your thought about the ability to monetize Google Maps over time? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","On advertising and monetization in YouTube, we talked a bit about it. We have taken it pretty seriously, and we are taking significant steps. And obviously as part of doing that, we have brought new technical solutions into place. Machine learning is a great example of it. It helps us enforce \u2013 as we improve our policies, it helps us enforce it better. And we are in early days, so as machine learning gets better, I think we'll be able to do all of this even better and create that virtuous cycle.","Overall, I'm pretty confident at the rate at which we have made progress. And we're going to continue investing a lot here. It is super important to us that this ecosystem works well. It matters for advertisers. It matters for content creators. And so we take that responsibility very seriously. I would say advertisers have clearly noticed all the improvements we have made. Our conversations with them are very, very positive, and so I'm pretty optimistic about how we'll continue to make progress here.","On Google Maps, your question is \u2013 it's a good question. I get surprised at, for a property which we had launched many, many years ago, even now it's showing strong growth, especially in emerging markets. Maps is an integral part of your mobile phone. And users get more interested in the real world around them with AR and so on, I think Maps will continue to play a bigger role. We take a long-term view. It's already impacting monetization very significantly for us with local search. So today, when you use Google, a lot of the information we are able to do is because of Google Maps. But I'm sure you've noticed changes within Google Maps over the past few months. If you open Google Maps, you're traveling or you're out on a Friday evening, we start surfacing a lot more interesting information about what you can do, places to eat, and so on. So those are beginning to get good feedback from users, and I think that gives us an opportunity to add value there over time as well.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, Sundar.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to follow up on Mark's question on the local opportunity. Assuming that you agree it's a large one, what kind of steps are you taking to educate the smaller businesses out there on the opportunities you have? You've mentioned increasing take-up of local inventory ads. We understand that. But more generally, a go-to-market strategy on how you reach the millions of SMBs out there in terms of educating them on the growing opportunities on a local basis. Thanks so much.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","It's a great question. And I think there's a lot of opportunity for us. Today we have many touch points. Obviously people \u2013 we reach out to SMBs, they want to get listed in Search and in Maps. AdWords Express has been a big part of how they want to advertise on our platforms. We obviously provide things like Google Apps to SMBs. So we have a lot of touch points, and internally we are beginning to do a much better job of reaching out and having a more thoughtful go-to-market approach. I think there's a lot more work there, but the rate at which we are seeing advertisers \u2013 small, medium businesses \u2013 on our platform has been growing very, very strongly as well. So indications are that it's already currently working at scale. We have millions and millions of SMBs on our platform, and the number continues to grow very well. But you'll see us invest a lot more here in the years ahead.","Peter C. Stabler - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, Sundar.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit more about the retail search category? Any high-level commentary on consumer search-query trends in retail, either an area of strength or otherwise? And then you talked about the real-time local-inventory integration, but, Sundar, I'd be curious if you could talk about any opportunities or areas of innovation in the retail search space that you see to really continue to improve users' retail-search experience. Thanks for the color.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","I think obviously when we see what users are looking for in mobile, how shopping is evolving, it's an area we're continuously working on. I've been happy to see the evolution in our shopping experiences. Retail overall also happens to be an amazing category for us from a Google Cloud standpoint, so in some ways we are developing deeper partnerships with retailers around the world. And so as we start doing that, and I think as we get a better understanding of their inventory and the data, how we can translate all of that into our core experience is a bit of the work ahead. I think that's what excites us about the longer term. Shorter term, I think it's a space we continue to invest in. We are actually seeing strong trends in that category.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I've got two questions on YouTube for Sundar. First, this morning on the earnings call, WPP's CEO, Sir Martin Sorrell, noted that the company is being very responsive, I think were his words, to some of the recent concerns that we'd talked about earlier in the Q&A. We've also seen some official policy changes, things like that. I'd be interested, Sundar, to hear a little bit more about some of the softer outreach that you may be doing, thinking of Philipp Schindler's team, maybe the agency relations team, and how your people are reaching out and connecting with their clients, especially as you go into Brandcast?","And then the second follow-up on YouTube was, I'd be interested to hear your updated thoughts on the role of the YouTube Spaces. I think Ruth's prepared comments on CapEx mentioned some investments in production equipment. I don't know if that is related to that or something related to Cloud, but it does seem that the Spaces remain an important part of YouTube and continue to grow. And I'd love to hear an updated view on them. Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","On the first part, (43:20) one of the things I've noticed is the depth of relationships we have with our advertisers was very evident to me as we went through this over the past few weeks. I would estimate \u2013 I think Philipp Schindler's team has probably made literally thousands and thousands of calls, in-person conversations, and I think that deep relationship is what allowed us to respond thoughtfully. And I think the feedback from our partners were very positive and constructive, and I think we are evolving overall to a better place. And so I think to me that shows the long-term investments you make in these relationships, et cetera, plays well at times like these. And Brandcast is again an important touch point, and the excitement ahead of Brandcast, both internally and from our partners, all has the right indications for us.","On YouTube on Spaces, I visited the YouTube Space. I took my family to the YouTube Space in New York, and we had a lot of fun. Our creators love these spaces. They are something we are thoughtfully building out. They have a good return on investment for us, but we are very thoughtful about it. And I don't think that's a major factor in any of the CapEx we talked about here.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Yeah, Exactly. In the CapEx, when I talked about production equipment, we were talking about machines, and that was the primary driver here. We're investing more machines given both our growing requirements and the higher cost of the new generation of machines and accelerators. So that will be more expensive in the short term, and we are continuing to build our inventory. But it does increase performance, and we believe reduce total cost of ownership in the longer term, so just to clarify that on CapEx.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. Thank you both for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. I'm not sure if this is for Sundar or Ruth, but a question about regulatory. You guys recently reached an agreement in Russia around the Android bundling issue, where you're going to provide options for other browsers and search engines and app stores when a new Android phone is activated. So I was just wondering if this is the right way to think about these kinds of disputes in other areas of the world, where you may be under some regulatory pressure around Android bundles, or if that was kind of a one-off, isolated agreement. Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","I think \u2013 without getting into specifics, I think when we deal with regulatory issues, I mean, the concerns vary differently depending on local laws and what the concerns are. I think in the case of Russia, I think there were some specific issues. And I'm glad we were able to work together with the regulatory agencies there, with our partners there, to come to a good solution. I'm not sure that's the right template. But as much as we are very committed to making sure we work with all the right agencies in all the countries we operate in, and I'm confident we'll get to a good place.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Great. Thank you. Sundar, ahead of this advertising conference I was thinking about Search innovation. And over the last four years, you've had an acceleration with PLAs, a really acceleration with the third ad link. And I'm just wondering, maybe you could talk about what excites you. Or do you think there's still a lot to go on Search monetization or coverage? And then from Ruth, obviously so many areas you can invest in. You could cut price on Cloud. You could really ramp up engineers in the core or Cloud. Just a lot you can do. And just how does the management team think about balancing profitability versus driving market share and long-term growth? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","On Search, I continue to get surprised by the kind of things users reach out to us for and how that keeps evolving and changing. And with the Assistant now, too, just exposes a whole new surface area. And so I think there's a lot of innovation ahead. In terms of monetization, I think about it \u2013 it still looks like there is a lot of \u2013 for example, if you just look at retail, 90% of retail is still offline. So there are many, many secular trends like that, which we look at and we see a huge opportunity to help connect users to the information they are looking for. So, structurally, I do think we still have lots of both innovation and growth ahead for the long term, and that's how we think about it.","Maybe to Ruth on the second part?","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Yeah, and really actually building on that, to answer the second part of your question. When we look at the ongoing momentum that you've seen here in Sites revenue, it really does go to innovation. No one change tends to drive results, it's really the combined benefit of all that we're doing across the franchise, continuing to invest in the business and the benefits that we see there. And that's the way we look at it, is we have tremendous opportunity continuing in mobile search and in YouTube across the business there. And as we're looking at these newer opportunities, all that we're doing in Cloud, in hardware, YouTube subscription businesses, we analyze each one of those individually, working very closely with the leaders and the milestones that are established there.","We do very much across the business have an operating principle that too many resources and too few can lead to suboptimal decisions and execution. And so what we're looking at over a multiyear period is the pace of innovation that's appropriate, given the sizable opportunity. But the key point \u2013 and I've said it on so many different calls \u2013 is that we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we're excited about the growth opportunities, not just within Google but across Alphabet with all that we're doing in Other Bets. And so we're looking at these, again, individually, over a multiyear period, looking at milestones, and appropriately calibrating the pace of investment that is logical. And at the same time, we continue to have a focus on enhancing efficiencies where we can. But overall, as I keep saying, our main priority remains revenue and profit dollar growth.","Operator","Thank you.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have two for Sundar. The first is, now that you've launched YouTube TV, I wonder if you'd tell us about the advertising opportunity there. And then what are you going to do, given all the assets, to maximize an inventory for marketers? And then secondly, I wonder, with that focus on brand safety you hear now from agencies and the bigger marketers, what's going to be the long-term impact, do you think, to YouTube programmatic from a more focused view on finding the right places to advertise?","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","On your first question about YouTube TV, we're just getting started. I think the product is really intended for the YouTube generation. It's really great to see a take on how to consume TV, which is mobile first for that generation. And I think \u2013 I've been using the product and enjoying it. And I think that gives \u2013 as (50:50) we rethink that experience and make it work better and scale it up, I think it's \u2013 your question is valid. The delivery of ads on TV has also not evolved at the same speed as the delivery of ads and media content on the Internet. So I think \u2013 we think we have a significant opportunity to improve their experience, and especially for advertisers to be able to think across all these surfaces. So I think there's a lot of opportunity, but I think we are very focused on the consumer experience first.","On your second question around longer-term impact, look, these types of issues are not new for us. Over the past many, many years, as we've built services, scaled it up on the ramp, (51:37) constantly things evolve. We adapt to it, be it from spam in email or how we do search ranking, and all the efforts we put into it. These are the classes of problems our engineers are really, really good at working. These are large-scale system problems, and especially with machine learning and AI, over time I think we can really put in the right systems in place. And our teams work very thoughtfully with the external ecosystem, with our advertisers, agencies, and partners. And I think that balance will help us get it right for the very long term.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente of Nomura. Your line is now open.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet","Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, Sites TAC as a percentage of revenue grew sequentially and year over year. I totally understand that mobile search is contributing meaningfully to the profit dollars, but as we look at the Sites TAC as a percentage, is there a quarter or is there a point in time looking forward where that sort of elevated TAC growth rate will anniversary or fall back into line with Sites revenue growth as a growth rate? Is there anything you can do to proactively manage that TAC growth?","And then for Sundar, on YouTube, as the competition out there for video content really intensifies, to what extent is YouTube providing more favorable economics to its content creators in order to ensure that YouTube remains the leading platform and, importantly, in a lot of cases, an exclusive platform for your most popular channels? Thank you.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","So on Sites TAC, as we've often discussed, and as you said in your question, there are a number of factors that affect Sites TAC as a percentage of Sites revenue, and the primary driver has been the strong growth in mobile and the fact that more mobile searches are subject to TAC. The other factors include the mix of paid versus organic, as well as changes in partner, mix, or agreement terms. And when we look year over year, the primary driver of the increase is \u2013 very much to your question \u2013 the strength in mobile search. And we do expect Sites TAC to increase as a percentage of revenues. But, again, our focus continues to be on growing profit dollars. And I think the main point is we're very pleased to have a very strong business in a rapidly growing area. And that's benefiting our profit dollars even as the TAC percentage increases.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","And on YouTube, when I look at it from a content creator standpoint, I think there are a lot of factors which are working well. So, for example, when we recently invested in original shows, we find that like over half the time people spend watching originals is on their mobile phones. We find that creators who are featured in originals experience a significant boost in YouTube subscribers and watch time on their main channels as well, often from new fans. So all of this shows us that the enthusiasm which is there for the platform, how creators can do unique things which are different from what they can do on other platforms. And I think that's what gives us the differentiation here. And in these areas, we are just getting started, and so there's a lot more to come. And I think that will help us provide better economics for them, better engagement for them, and I think positions us well.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Instinet","Thank you both.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Sundar, when we think about virtual reality and augmented reality, from your point of view, what are the key steps that are needed to see more mass market appeal and usage? And could you help quantify the amount of investment that you are willing to place in this area before you expect to see a payoff? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","So I think obviously you're seeing we are very happy with the progress we have seen with Daydream. Just like we built Android, we are good at building platforms and ecosystems, and I think we are taking the right first steps with VR there as well. When I broadly look at VR and AR, I think all of us clearly understand the potential, and technically we are making the breakthroughs that are needed. And all of it needs to converge, from a hardware, software, services standpoint, to a stage where it has mass-market appeal. And I think that is still some ways away.","The thing which gives me excitement is all these changes start happening with a set of early adopters and moves mainstream, and so we're engaging at that level with the early adopters. And that's where Daydream is working well. We are learning how to write great content on top of VR. YouTube, Google Earth VR, Tilt Brush \u2013 these are all great examples. So underlying technology wise, be it all the kinds of sensors and tracking you need to do, the machine learning and AI you need, things like voice recognition, everything \u2013 it's just a computing evolution, so everything we are investing today in machine learning and AI, as well as what we're doing in our computing platforms, transitions well. So I think we're already well-positioned to play this, and so I think we'll thoughtfully approach it. And we'll approach it more holistically.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you. I guess just as a follow-up to the question on voice interfaces and personal assistant, something that Larry also called out in his founder's letter. It appears there are more tests around monetization, including transactions and integration with Shopping Express. I wonder if there's a view internally now as to how best to make that transition in a voice-first world towards monetization, towards voice and less tech spend and video-centric? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","We are very focused, actually, on the consumer experience now, and it's a good question. And we've always had these questions, be it the early days of Search or when YouTube was first built out. How do I see (58:09) experiences created, like will YouTube ever make money? And so I think if you go and create these experiences in a way that works at scale for users, the monetization will follow. And obviously \u2013 and the models will be different than what we have today, but I think we are squarely focused right now on delivering a world-class experience through voice and through Assistant.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer session for today.

With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor.","Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses and our expected level of capital expenditures.

We had a terrific quarter. Revenues of 27.8 billion were up 24% year-on-year, and also up 24% in constant currency. Advertising revenues benefited from strong performance in sites, which was powered by tremendous results in mobile search. Healthy growth in network revenues was again led by our programmatic business. We also benefited from substantial growth in other revenues from cloud, play and hardware.","Our outline for today's call is, first, I'll view the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet, focusing on year-over-year changes. Next, I will review results for Google and then Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook. Sundar will then discuss business and product highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.","Let me start with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial performance for the quarter. Total revenues were $27.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year. We realized a positive currency impact on our revenues year-over-year of $255 million or $64 million after the impact of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to the prior period, our total revenues grew 24% year-over-year.","Turning to Alphabet revenues by geography; performance was strong in all regions. U.S. revenues were $12.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. EMEA revenues were $9.1 billion, up 23% year-over-year in both reported and fixed FX terms. APAC revenues were $4.2 billion, up 29% versus last year and up 31% in fixed FX terms. Other Americas revenues were $1.5 billion, up 33% year-over-year and up 32% in fixed FX terms.","On a consolidated basis, total cost of revenues, including TAC, which I'll discuss in the Google segment results, were $11.1 billion, up 28% year-on-year. Other cost of revenues on a consolidated basis was $5.6 billion, up 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses. Specifically, costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and hardware-related costs.","Operating expenses were $8.8 billion, up 11% year-over-year. The year-on-year expense growth in part reflects the change in the timing of our annual equity refresh cycle from the third quarter to the first quarter of each year. As discussed previously, this change in SBC grant timing affects the quarterly pace of stock-based compensation in 2017, with elevated year-on-year expense growth in the first half of the year, but benefits the year-on-year comparisons for Q3 and Q4.","Stock-based compensation totaled $1.8 billion. Headcount at the end of the quarter was 78,101, up 2,495 people from last quarter. As in prior quarters, the vast majority of new hires were engineers and product managers. In terms of product areas, the most sizable head count additions were once again made in cloud for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we place on this business.","Operating income was $7.8 billion, up 35% versus last year, and the operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was $197 million. We provide more detail on the line items within OI&E in our earnings press release. Our effective tax rate was 15.6% for the third quarter. Net income was $6.7 billion and earnings per diluted share were $9.57.","Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow. Cash CapEx for the quarter was $3.5 billion. Operating cash flow was $9.9 billion with free cash flow of $6.3 billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $100.1 billion, of which approximately $60.5 billion or 60% is held overseas.","Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with the Google segment. Revenues were $27.5 billion, up 23% year-over-year. In terms of the revenue detail, Google sites revenues were $19.7 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year, led again by mobile search, complemented by desktop search and strong performance from YouTube.","Network revenues were $4.3 billion, up 16% year-on-year, reflecting the ongoing momentum of programmatic and AdMob. Other revenues for Google were $3.4 billion, up 40% year-over-year, fueled by cloud, play and hardware. Finally, we continue to provide monetization metrics to give you a sense of the price and volume dynamics of our advertising businesses. You can find the details in our earnings press release.","Total traffic acquisition costs were $5.5 billion or 23% of total advertising revenues and up 32% year-over-year. The increase in sites TAC as a percentage of sites revenues as well as network TAC as a percentage of network revenues, continues to reflect the fact that our strongest growth areas, namely mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.","Total TAC, as a percentage of total advertising revenues, was up year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the sites TAC rate, which was modestly offset by a favorable revenue mix shift from network to sites. The increase in the sites TAC rate year-over-year was driven by changes in partner agreements and the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.","Google's stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 2% year-over-year. Operating income including the impact of SBC was $8.7 billion, up 29% versus last year and the operating margin was 32%. Accrued CapEx for the quarter was $3.6 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, facilities and data center construction.","Let me now turn and talk about Other Bets. For the third quarter, Other Bets revenues were $302 million, primarily generated by Nest, Fiber, and Verily. Operating loss including the impact of SBC was $812 million for the third quarter.","Other Bets accrued CapEx was $77 million, primarily reflecting a reduced investment in Fiber, due to the pause in expansion we announced in 3Q 2016. We're pleased with our progress across Other Bets.","A couple of updates; Nest continues to drive ongoing product expansion with a number of notable launches including the Nest Thermostat E, which is offered at a lower price point than the Nest Learning Thermostat. Nest also announced a home security solution that includes the Nest Secure alarm system, Nest Hello video doorbell, the Nest Cam IQ outdoor security camera and corresponding software and services.","Waymo continues to expand its geographic presence and announced this morning that it will commence winter testing in Michigan to build on our progress to-date addressing the challenge of autonomous driving in cold weather, particularly with snow, sleet and ice. Michigan is the sixth state where Waymo is testing its self-driving vehicles. Over the last eight years, Waymo's cars have self-driven in more than 20 cities.","With Loon, we were pleased to announce just last week that the team is collaborating with AT&T to deliver emergency Internet service to the hardest hit parts of Puerto Rico.","Let me close with some observations on the quarter and our longer-term outlook. First, in terms of revenues, results this quarter again reflect our relentless focus on innovation, which is growing our advertising revenues. I frequently highlight our culture of innovation.","In that regard, the most important point is that we are data driven with an extraordinary team of engineers, product managers and designers, who constantly challenge assumptions and run thousands of experiments annually to enhance user and advertiser experiences. This approach enables us to find new opportunities given that the way consumers seek information continues to evolve. Our teams work relentlessly to anticipate and adapt to the expanding capabilities of both software and hardware.","Further, our culture of innovation is building our non-advertising revenue streams in cloud, play and hardware. Earlier this month, for example, we launched our expanded line of hardware products, bringing the best AI software and hardware together and building on the first generation of Made by Google products we introduced last year. Longer-term, we remain excited about the opportunities in our Other Bets with ongoing progress.","Second, with respect to profitability, we continue to remain focused on long-term dollar growth versus margins. Pressure in our total cost of revenues reflects our product mix shift with a number of our higher growth businesses also carrying higher cost of revenues. In our advertising businesses, TAC continues to increase as our highest growth areas, mobile search and programmatic, carry higher TAC.","We expect sites TAC to continue to increase as a percentage of sites revenue. As we've frequently stated, we remain focused on profit dollar growth, and these areas are additive to our growth.","The other cost of revenues associated with our non-advertising businesses is also affected by product mix. In the fourth quarter in particular, the impact of our growing hardware line will be more accentuated given the early stage of this business and holiday seasonality.","On operating expenses, we remain committed to investing to support our growing product areas. The more modest OpEx growth in Q3 reflects both the timing of stock-based compensation and the timing of sales and marketing spend, with the reality that not all investments fall neatly into a single calendar quarter.","In particular, we're committed to sales and marketing investments in Q4 for the important holiday season. The most significant uptick in marketing will be to support our new expanded hardware line, which was just announced at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In addition, we are investing to support YouTube and our other platforms.","Third, as to CapEx, we continue to invest to support business momentum, including increased compute power from machine learning, which is an asset across Alphabet as well as to support cloud, search and YouTube growth.","In conclusion, a great quarter. Thank you. And let me now turn the call over to Sundar.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Thank you, Ruth. We had another great quarter. I've been really proud of the progress this quarter, launching popular new products and continuing to grow our business in new areas. It's been particularly exciting to see our early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to something that can solve new problems for a billion people a day.","Even though we are in the early days of AI, we are already rethinking how to build products around machine learning. It's a new paradigm compared to mobile-first software, and I'm thrilled how Google is leading the way.","Consumers can already experience how AI allows them to interact with computing more naturally than ever before. Computers are adapting to people rather than people needing to adapt to computers.","Fundamental to this experience is Google Search and our Assistant. We introduced Assistant last year and it continues to get better every day, helping people get things done in the real world. Walmart and Target have recently integrated with Google Home, which means you can order everyday items from them much more easily.","500 million people now use the machine learning smarts of Google Photos to manage and share their memories. That billion plus people using Google Maps now get thoughtfully contextual information like how to find parking where they are going. And businesses are seeing how AI can help them grow.","Our open-source software, TensorFlow, is allowing anyone to use machine learning to solve problems even in industries like agriculture. Researches recently use TensorFlow to make smartphones able to identify disease in cassava plants, a major food source in the developing world.","We made TensorFlow open-source and free because we fundamentally believe in creating computing platforms that developers can customize and build on. I'm really pleased with the way our computing platforms, like Android and Chrome, have continued to grow, enabling great experiences for people all over the world and powering devices for more than 1,000 brands worldwide.","This quarter, we released the latest operating system, Android 8.0, and released a preview of ARCore, which brings augmented reality to existing Android phones. Last week, we announced a partnership with Samsung to bring ARCore to all Galaxy devices.","Even though it's been an incredible busy few years and technology is moving rapidly, at our core, we remain an information company. Our mission to provide useful information to people in every corner of the world is unchanged. We care deeply about the quality of information we provide and constantly work to get this right. As technology evolves, we have to evolve with it to ensure quality information can flourish.","Our teams are making a big effort to support journalists and other people who produce high-quality information around the world. We are supporting publishers as they decide the right approach to free articles and subscription content. We are moving away from first click free to a more flexible model of content sampling. And we are working with publishers to build a frictionless payment solutions for subscriptions that can help them grow revenues and find new readers.","As new threats arise, we are committed to protecting journalists and media organizations from hacking and denial-of-service attacks. For example, we just launched the advanced production program for Google accounts, which is designed to protect the accounts of those most at risk of targeted attacks, including journalists and other public figures. To wrap up my overview, I'm thrilled with how Google is solving big problems and making products that billions of people use every day.","Now let's review our three big bets, starting with YouTube. YouTube continues to see phenomenal growth as the premier global destination where people go to watch video. Three of the key areas we are focused on are; strengthening the existing community, continuing to drive growth and expanding our subscriptions business.","On the community side, we are helping create meaningfully interactions that bring creators and fans closer together. This quarter, we launched a new feature that lets viewers share videos directly in the app. So the minute you see a video from a creator you love, you can share the fun with friends and family. We're also seeing significant growth in other areas.","As I mentioned in the last earnings call, YouTube now has over 1.5 billion users. On average, these users spend 60 minutes a day on mobile. But this growth isn't just happening on desktop and mobile. YouTube now gets over 100 million hours of watch time in the living room every day, and that's up 70% in the past year alone.","We are continuing to invest in new subscription based monetization models. YouTube Red, our first foray into the subscription market, is on track to release over 40 original shows this year and YouTube TV, our live TV subscription service, continues to expand into new markets. It now covers two-thirds of U.S. households and is available in 15 metro areas.","Now on to Google Cloud; we continue to make progress winning over enterprise customers. Customers tell us they are switching to Google Cloud Platform because of our prowess in data analytics and machine learning, our commitment to being an open platform with tools like Kubernetes, which runs in both cloud and hybrid environments and our leadership in security.","Just yesterday we announced a new partnership at Cisco. We are collaborating on an open solution that gives customers an easy approach to the cloud, enabling them to run apps that span both on-prem environments and Google Cloud Platform. G Suites, our collaboration and productivity applications are leading the industry. We have made improvements to drive, docs and Gmail launching new features to help teams work better together.","Nielsen recently moved to G Suite and said it's a great productivity and collaboration tool for their modern workforce. All of these things are driving momentum with customers and partners. Companies like Kohls, PayPal, Rolls-Royce Marine in Europe and popular messaging app, Hike in India, moved to Google Cloud. We also announced a new partnership with Marketo and expanded our relationship with Pivotal and VMware. To support our growing global customer base, we introduced two new regions in the quarter in S\u00e3o Paulo and Frankfurt and continue to grow our go-to-market team.","Next, our hardware business. Earlier this month, we launched our second-generation family of Made by Google hardware products built with AI at the core. Last year, we focused on building the foundation to launch a line of devices Made by Google. This year, we are focused on bringing together the best AI software and hardware to give people a great user experience.","For example, the new Google Home Max is a smart speaker powered by the Assistant. It has AI-based smart sound, which adapts the audio experience to the user's environment context and preferences.","The new Pixel 2 has the world's best smartphone camera and a useful feature where you can summon the Google Assistant by just squeezing the phone. To get these devices in people's hands, we are also focused on scaling our go-to-market strategy. We are investing more in marketing. We're launching in more countries and we are offering these devices in more retailers, and we are already seeing results. Pre-orders of Pixel on day one this year were more than double what they were last.","Also this quarter, we signed a deal with HTC in Taiwan that will help accelerate our hardware business by bringing on a team of talented engineers. This deal lays the foundation for our continued efforts next year. And our advertising platforms continue to drive great results for our partners. While mobile has given rise to an unprecedented amount of data and complexity for advertisers, we think that machine learning will help it make \u2013 will help make it easier for advertisers to reach consumers. But even as we give advertisers incredible scale and reach across our ad platforms, we know consumer attention is scarce. That's why we are pleased YouTube ads continue to deliver the highest viewability rates in the industry.","YouTube now has a 95% ad viewability rate, which is significantly higher than the average 66% viewability rate of other video ads. We continue to see the industry shift to six second bumper ads and so greater adoption this quarter from brands like Bear, Ben & Jerry's, Louis Vuitton and Volvo. And Google continues to be the platform of choice to help small business owners get online and grow their business.","On our last earnings call, I mentioned a free website builder for small businesses. During the quarter, more than 1 million small businesses used it to build up websites, helping many of them get online for the first time. We also introduced local post, which allows small business owners to easily post their latest updates like upcoming events, special offers and new arrivals, right on Google Search in Maps.","Our commitment to both large and small advertisers shows how we build products that all businesses can succeed in. That mission also has a geographical dimension, and I wanted to say a word about the momentum we are seeing in Asia.","Our revenues are up significantly in the region, driven by great results we are driving for existing and new advertisers. That holds true across developed markets like Japan and emerging markets like the Philippines and Vietnam, all of which have seen the number of active advertisers grow by 25% or more in the past 12 months. And this growth is bringing tremendous benefits to our partners there.","In the past three years, we have paid out more than $24 billion to our publisher, creator and app developer partners in Asia Pacific. And to help millions of people, we are building products specifically designed for local markets in Asia.","In India last month, we launched Tez, a mobile payments and commerce app that already has more than 7.5 million users who have made more than 30 million transactions. I'm really excited about the potential this brings for India's mostly cash-based economy.","As I said at the start, it's been a great quarter for Google. Just two weeks ago, I was in Pittsburgh launching our new Grow with Google initiative, which provides digital skills to millions of people and economic opportunity to countless businesses. It was amazing to see firsthand the transformative impact that information is having in schools, in the workplace and for local business.","As I said then, I remain a technology optimist, not only because I believe in technology, but because I believe in people. I want to thank all the Googlers who continue to work so hard to advance our mission and to help people everywhere. Thank you.","Ellen West - Alphabet, Inc.","Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. One, we've seen a lot of partnership announcements intra-quarter on the e-commerce side with Google Express and voice assisted shopping on Google Home. Wanted to understand better your ambitions in e-commerce as a marketplace or a platform and how that might also feed back into the advertising business?","Second question would be about the cash on the balance sheet and sort of how philosophically you think about deploying that cash against either shareholder returns or some of the big opportunities you laid out today? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Maybe I'll take the first question and give it to Ruth on the cash question. We are very excited about the partnerships we are getting here with large retailers, and we are seeing traction globally. We've obviously partnered with them through our advertising products.","But with shopping, especially as we move on to making shopping more seamless across mobile and newer computing categories like Google Home, I think there's tremendous interest here.","So we are just getting started. And I think you will see us make a lot more progress and have a lot more announcements. And I think we are going to be relentlessly focused on making the buying experience much more seamless for users. So there's a lot more to come.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","So in terms of your second question. There was really no change from the approach we've talked about previously as we think about capital allocation. The priority is organic, as you said in your question. We have a host of really exciting opportunities and ensuring that we're investing to support long-term growth remains number one.","The second is strategic, continuing to add on where it makes sense. We're pleased to have added on HTC this quarter. Acquisitions have obviously been an important part of our history. And then the third is the return of capital and no change or update there in terms of how we think about that.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks. Two questions, please. Sundar, you talked about APAC. You called out Asia. And we noticed that too, that that year-over-year growth rate was higher than \u2013 it was the highest, at least since you've been disclosing that. And you provided some of whats, but any whys behind why that growth is accelerating? Is that something that has just naturally reached the tipping point? Is there something different that Alphabet\/Google has done in Asia to accelerate that growth?","And then, Ruth, can I ask you. You talked about the factors driving TAC and you mentioned changes in partner agreements. Is there any way you could give us any more color? Did you just renew some major partner agreements and there's nothing of that magnitude into next year? Or should we just assume that this is just part of operations, there was nothing major recent, you could have major ones coming up? Just something to help us qualify \u2013 I don't you think you'd used that language before \u2013 what that indicated? Thanks a lot.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","The Asia question, largely, I think we've been laying a foundation for a very, very long time. Our products are very heavily used there. And so we've worked hard to build a user base and then the mobile transformation is a secular shift there. That's definitely driving accelerated growth. And it creates a virtuous cycle. We see new advertisers coming on.","We are investing more in Asia as well in addition to our go-to-market teams. We are building out great product and engineering teams. That's what has led us to improve core products like Search, Maps, YouTube, et cetera, to work better in those regions. And also launched region-specific products like Google Tez in India. So I think, overall, that's creating a good virtuous cycle and I'm looking forward to having more momentum there.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","And on your TAC question, as I indicated in the opening comments. There are a couple of drivers here. One is changes in partner agreements. And I think the main point is we're very pleased with our strong partnerships across the mobile ecosystem. And the other was the ongoing shift to mobile, which we've talked about a lot and the fact that it carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points.","I think the most important point is that what you're seeing is we have a very healthy mobile business, search business and it is growing substantially and our focus remains on long-term revenue and profit dollar growth.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. I had two. First, Ruth, you talked about the ongoing advertising innovation, and it's pretty clear that that's happening in mobile, which seems like it probably accelerated in the quarter. So I was hoping if you could comment on that. But then also, how do you think about where you are in terms of optimization on mobile relative to desktop? And then just second on YouTube. I was hoping you could comment on the extent to which you're seeing marketers return to the platform post the brand safety issues of 2Q and for a few of those who may not be back on yet, what are they looking for to fully return? Thanks.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","So it felt like a number of calls talked about the fact that there was no one item that was driving the momentum we saw in our sites revenue, and that was the point of giving you a bit more color here. We are really pleased with the momentum in the business, excited about the opportunities we have given the ongoing strong underlying secular trend, but wanted to give you more color on what do we mean by a culture of innovation, and that's really why I tried to get into a bit more about the rigor of the process.","And one of the key points is that we do have the opportunity, and we anchor this indeed, that we're constantly challenging assumptions. We're running a lot of experiments to enhance user and advertiser experience. And the approach continues to be productive, especially because the line of inquiry evolves as user behavior evolves. And so what users wanted in the earlier days of smartphones when screens were smaller is obviously, very different from expectations users have today. Each quarter, the ads team introduces more than 100 enhancements out of a much larger pool of assumptions that they've tested. Machine learning is at the center of our processes and systems. And we do remain excited about the potential.","Desktop, I commented on. We are pleased with the ongoing strength of the business. It delivered solid revenue growth that remains an important form factor for certain more complex tasks. We've talked about that in prior quarters. Things like planning vacations or assessing insurance options. And so I think with the strength here underscores the importance of desktop for many users in many task, notwithstanding, the growing utility of mobile for users.","And then in terms of YouTube, I think you asked it. Well, we've been doing a lot to protect the ecosystems and do the right things for advertisers and users and content creators and the overwhelming majority of advertisers never left and those who did, many are already back on the platform.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, Ruth.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you so much. Sundar, I was wondering if you could share with us your thoughts on voice search. And I guess, in particular, how do you think about maintaining Google fleet as the way we search changes, and as we see increasing adoption of these voice-enabled digital assistance in the home? And part of it, I guess, I'm also wondering about is how do you think about your relationships with the partners? And if the device base broadens out, does your leverage with the partners change? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","It's a good question, Heather. Voice, it's important to remember, voice is one input. When you look at how customers interact, they obviously are interacting more and more naturally, seamlessly across a set of screens, computing works and context for them. And even then when they asked voice queries, the response always what they need is not voice alone. Think about walking into a store and if you could only ask using voice and the person has to reply in voice what all is in the store. So that model applies.","So we expect a lot of continual experiences across screens, across modalities. So it's a big opportunity. I think it's opening up newer ways in which we are working with partners. I spoke earlier about the kind of experiences we are now able to drive at Walmart and Target, which we could have done a year before. Thanks to voice, how we are using it in the Google Assistant and how we are driving these partnerships.","So there's a lot of excitement about how we can do all of this differently. So we are using this as a good way to rethink everything we are doing with the caveat that voice still, overall, is an emerging category compared to how users use our products. So there's a lot of room ahead.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, I like to \u2013 maybe discuss a couple of your growth businesses. First, on cloud. Maybe you could talk about some of the wins you're seeing and why people are necessarily choosing Google and the momentum there?","And then, secondly, on the hardware business. It feels a little confusing on what your real goal is there. Is that to build a real independent separate hardware business? And how the Android relationships are going around that? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","First on cloud. Effectively, we are seeing strong momentum. And we already hear from customers that we have outstanding technology. So the reason we win deals in many cases is because we have superior technology and people also see the room ahead, thanks to a lead in machine learning. And that's an area where I think we'll continue to drive advantage. The main area where we need to get better is to scale our go-to-market and be in more places to effectively get more customers. And we are doing that a few different ways, Diane and team have really skilled our global sales force. But more importantly, I think we are striking a lot of important partnerships with leading technology vendors to scale and reach more customers.","And so be the partnership at Cisco that we announced or, in this quarter, we also teamed up with Pivotal and VMware. And earlier the year, you saw us partner with SAP. And all of this help customers more easily run their apps, both on-prem and in the cloud. And we are doing this all in a open way with Kubernetes. So that's the overall strategy, and I think that's really beginning to pay off. And you will see us scale across all these dimensions for cloud in the year ahead.","In terms of hardware, we are very seriously committed to making hardware. Few reasons. Hardware is \u2013 the intersection of hardware and software is how you drive computing forward. And historically, hardware has been maybe a single device business. For a long while, it was PCs then maybe plus smartphones. But you're clearly entering an era where you going to have different types of computing experiences. And so to do that and to stitch it all together across, I think it's important we thoughtfully put our opinion forward. We're equally committed to working with the ecosystems and we provide the same basis on both sides, be it Android or Chrome. And it's going really well.","Our close partnership this quarter across a set of Android partners. You see great momentum at the recently launched Samsung Note 8. We announced ARCore on Samsung devices. So we have strong momentum there as well. So we're committed to pushing forward hard on all these areas.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. I had a question for either Sundar or Ruth. It's just a philosophical question on TAC. So as the mobile search market matures, particularly in the Western markets, the question is, why does Google feel like it needs to pay any TAC to partners at all? Is the lesson learned from the Firefox, desktop partner loss a couple of years ago was that you didn't lose any revenue and you stopped paying TAC on that agreement, why wouldn't the same logic apply to mobile search? If not now, at some point in the future?","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Look, I mean, first of all, we have a lot of experience in this area. We've been doing distribution deals for our search for well over a decade and I personally been involved all the way from the toolbar in the Chrome days. So by now, first of all, we want to construct a win-win construct. So we always want to construct in which we do better when our partners to better. And so doing TAC well aligns us in that way and, historically, it has driven a lot of growth. And so it's a model we understand. We understand the key economics behind it. And so we are very thoughtful about how we drive it forward. So we are driving it forward in a way in which we know it's going to give strong both revenue and earnings growth. And so I think we are pretty comfortable with how we are approaching it and so we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just the first one, a little bit on growing Alphabet's multi-app ecosystem. Sundar, how do you think about the strategic importance to drive Chrome and Google Assistant app installs and user growth on non-Android mobile platforms? Maybe talk about how you evaluate, how you're doing there so far?","And then bigger picture. You've made large and exciting investment in growth opportunities across Google and Other Bets. I'd be curious to hear philosophically, how do you evaluate these opportunities and talk about some of the ROI thought processes or evaluation you make when making large capital allocation decisions?","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","So, on the first one. One of the unique things about how we approach product development is we've always, at Google, care about building our products for everyone. And be it Search or Gmail or Google Photos or Chrome, we work hard to drive it across all platforms.","Obviously, some products, their ability to make it work well on other platforms versus our native platforms, there are differences and so we understand that. It's partly why we are very committed to driving success on our platforms, both through the ecosystem and our hardware efforts as well.","So we think about it holistically. But you'll continue to see us put a lot of effort into other platforms as well. For example, over the past couple of years, I think we've meaningfully improved our products on iOS, as an example.","On the other part, maybe Ruth, do you want to give color. I would just say, at a high level, we drive our investments because we think about it from a user perspective first. We see areas where there are clear user problems and we think about whether we can use computer science and our technology advantage as Google and Alphabet to give a differentiated offering for users. And we do that and then we think long-term. But that's how we do about it. Maybe Ruth can give more color there, too.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","And then the numbers flow out of that, which is we look over a multi-year period. A lot of the things that we're doing are multi-year investments, and that's why we stress repeatedly that we're looking at what are the long-term needs and opportunities that we could be addressing, if we're doing that well, we're delivering long-term revenue and earnings growth. And those investments need to be seeded early for them to continue to grow and flourish around the globe. Whether that responds to the first question on what's going on in APAC or across Alphabet more broadly, we take a multi-year look. We look at the business, technical, financial milestones along the way, and we allocate resources in order to make sure we're maximizing the long-term potential to deliver as we see is appropriate.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thank you. I have two for Sundar, one on HTC. It's kind of interesting thing that you didn't buy the company, but you bought talent. And I wonder, what does that move directly give you? And what did you think was lacking, I guess, from the product side before you made that move? Then I had one on YouTube.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","On HTC, as we were working on our hardware efforts, we've been working with HTC very closely on the Pixel phones. So across the two companies, we saw a win-win construct, by which we could bring the team and the IP and other assets related to the Pixel business in-house. And it also allows HTC to focus better on their phones and the other products they're working on.","So it just made a lot of sense to do it. And I would also think about the overall capability we are getting, not just to make phones, but as we get into other product categories, like Google Home, VR and so on, right? And so it's important to continue to build that out. And the talent we saw there is definitely best-in-class.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And then on DIRECTV \u2013 sorry, YouTube TV. It's clear that you guys have pretty good momentum, 50 markets already. I wonder, what has surprised you about the early consumer engagements? Anything you could share about early findings on the rollout of YouTube TV?","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","Yeah, main thing I would say is the consumer feedback, I think there's always been this promise on being able to, just like today on Google Search when you want something, we make it so easy for you to find it. Bringing that kind of a seamless experience on to TV, when you think about something you want to watch, making it seamless. And so, improving that process, I think, is really what people positively comment on.","Other things are being able to personalize it, bringing our machine learning-based recommendations over time. So that's how people notice. They get content, in which they are interested in, surfaced much better. So I think given where we are, I'm really excited at the initial reception. And we are gathering a lot of feedback, bringing it to more markets, and I'm going to work hard at making the product better.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks, Sundar.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Salmon of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sundar, I'd like to just follow-up on an earlier question about e-commerce and specifically, a trend we see growing across the ecosystem of applying e-commerce data to targeting advertising. Maybe if you could describe how you view that at a high level and whether that's important to you, and growing that opportunity across all of your platforms. And perhaps, shed some light on areas where you may be able to tap into that. You discussed partnerships with retailers, Android Pay. You're tracking off-line conversions more, even a product like Customer Match would seem like it'd be an opportunity to have your advertisers bring that type of data to the table. Would love to hear a little bit more about your thoughts on that?","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","It's a good question, Dan. You kind of partially answered it. So you're welcome to come and work on our e-commerce team anytime. To us, as a vertical, we see huge opportunities there. There's a lot of flywheel effects we see. Almost all e-commerce providers are really interested in, like, cloud for obvious reasons. So we see tremendous traction by which we are \u2013 we can talk to them about cloud. They're already advertising partners. They're beginning to work with us much more closely on driving a seamless shopping experience. We're working on payments. And so, it creates a nice flywheel effect, and we can do this globally across all the countries we do it in. And so, we are treating it more thoughtfully and investing in addressing the vertical opportunity we see in front of us, and we'll continue working on that.","Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of follow-ups. First on TAC, wondering if changes in partner agreements, since those are one of the key drivers of the increase in TAC, could we then see the rate of TAC growth moderate as you anniversary those deals?","And then, secondly, as it relates to voice and visual search inputs, I know it's still early for Google Lens. But overall, I'm wondering what portion of those search queries are proving to be incremental to search, the search experience, or are they largely substituting for searches on screens? Thank you.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","So in terms of TAC, as I indicated, we've got a couple of things going on. We're pleased with our strong partnerships. We continue to stress the impact from the shift to mobile. And again, both Sundar and I have said it, our focus remains on the profit dollar growth. And we've got a really nice position and a strong growth area. So that's what you're seeing here. But as I also said, we do expect it to increase some from here. And you've got a couple of factors going on.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","On the second thing, look, I think based on every metric we see users' information needs are only going up. And the amount of information they deal with are increasing. And as we add new modalities, it really drives a better experience for them.","Google Lens, there's a long way to go. But today, as humans, visual input is really big for us. I mean, it's a lot higher bandwidth than everything else. And so bringing back to computing, I think, is a really important step in advancing how users can process information. And so I see that as an important step. And thanks to machine learning, we'll be able to do these things a lot more powerfully. All of this I think, overall, adds to the search experience. And so I view that as all incremental, but it'll play out slowly over many years. And so we see this as a big opportunity ahead and we are investing for it.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. The revenue growth was one of the highest growth rates you've seen in five years. I'm just curious if there was something that surprised you in the quarter or something that perhaps was an anomaly that we should be thinking about modeling going forward?","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","So I tried to give you a bit of color going across the major lines. We feel we're really pleased with the sites' revenue growth, the performance in mobile desktop and YouTube. I think if you just go down to the big categories, network revenue also was quite strong. I think one thing to add there is programmatic continues to be a strong contributor. Generate significant growth, we've talked about that on prior calls.","Given all the ongoing advertiser adoption of programmatic buying and AdMob continues to see strength. What you're also seeing here is the traditional AdSense businesses. Overall, the pace of advertiser migration to programmatic affects this business kind of quarter-on-quarter as well as the policy changes that we've talked about in prior quarters. And those factors were less of a drag in the last couple of quarters.","So you actually saw nicer revenue growth year-on-year here as well. It was up 16%. And then Sundar's talked a lot about the components of other revenues up nicely. We're really pleased with what's going on there and then, on top of that, Other Bets. So we've got a couple of components to it and tried to give you color on each one.","Brent Thill - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. So Sundar, can you talk about how Google is positioning in the emerging markets over the longer term can be different versus what we are used to seeing here in the States. I mean, you talked about Tez in India, and that's just type of stuff that we're not even seeing here in the States. So is there a broader opportunity for you to do a larger land grab with more products?","And Ruth, should we assume that the relative size of the dollar contribution to the other revenue growth happened in the order you gave out in the prepared remarks, I guess, cloud, play, hardware? And if so, this would make it the second quarter in a row in which cloud is showing up as the largest contributor, I guess, as opposed to the third. So any perspective you can share in terms of the relative growth you maybe seeing recently? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Alphabet, Inc.","On emerging markets, we do see a differentiated opportunity there partly because the characteristics of how truly many of these markets came mobile first, I think, gives rise to different ways users are adopting our products. And also, more importantly, the ecosystem, which is built around, so for example, if you take e-commerce, the kind of models that are emerging in these countries are also a bit different. So I think we see a way to look at these markets with a lot more thought and address them for the opportunity that they have, not just apply our global products there. So I think that's what led us to do Google Tez in India. And we'll thoughtfully look at the opportunities in that region and invest a lot in the years ahead.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","And then we do \u2013 we did list them in the order in which they're making a contribution. It's obviously a mix of businesses. As we've talked about, we have very strong growth in each of cloud and hardware that was tempered by slightly slower growth in Q3 for Play, reflecting what's the hit-driven nature of that business of gaming. But again, feel really pleased with the progress, momentum that we're seeing in the various businesses. And I guess, the only other thing to notice, obviously, is seasonality on the hardware as we move into the fourth quarter here.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ellen West for any closing remarks.","Ellen West - Alphabet, Inc.","Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ellen West, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Ellen West - Google, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai.","Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz\/investor. Please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases. This call is also being webcast from abc.xyz\/investor, where a replay of the call will be available later today.","I'll now turn the call over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Thanks. Revenue momentum in Q4 underscored the strength of our businesses globally, with consolidated revenue growth accelerating meaningfully versus last year. The primary driver was the increased use of mobile search by consumers, benefiting from our ongoing efforts to enhance the efficacy of mobile search as well as from the holiday season. In addition, results reflect ongoing momentum in YouTube and programmatic advertising. There were a number of unusual items in the quarter that I will address during the discussion of results.","With a move to our new Alphabet structure, we conducted a detailed review of business opportunities and investment levels across Google and Other Bets. We made some important decisions to prioritize the allocation of resources and capital to maximize long-term potential within each area. We are pleased to be sharing financial results for each of Google and what we call the Other Bets and thereby provide more visibility into financial trends in each segment.","In light of our move to segment reporting, I'm going to present to you in this order: first, review the quarter on a consolidated basis for Alphabet; second, review the results for each of Google and Other Bets. Finally, I will conclude with key themes for the near term. Sundar will then review our business and products highlights for the quarter, after which we will take your questions.","Beginning with a summary of Alphabet's consolidated financial operational performance, total revenue was $21.3 billion, up 18% year over year and up 14% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues year over year of $1.3 billion, or $1 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 24% year over year and 15% sequentially.","Alphabet revenues by geography also highlight both the strength of our business around the globe as well as the impact the currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business. U.S. revenue was up 24% year over year to $10.3 billion and up 18% versus Q3. UK revenue was up 16% year over year to $1.9 billion and up 7% sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 20% year over year and 9% quarter over quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 12% versus last year to $9.1 billion and up 12% versus Q3. In fixed FX terms, revenues were up 26% year over year and up 14% sequentially.","Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.9 billion in Q4, up 24% year over year, primarily driven by Google-related expenses, most notably due to costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, and hardware costs due to the launch of our new Nexus, Chromecast, and Pixel devices.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $6.6 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% year over year and up 15% versus Q3, primarily driven by R&D expense, particularly affected by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago.","On a GAAP basis, operating income was $5.4 billion, up 22% versus last year. The operating margin was 25%. Adjusting for stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP operating income was $6.8 billion, up 22% versus last year. The operating margin was 32%.","With respect to stock-based compensation, it totaled $1.4 billion, up 20% year over year and flat sequentially, primarily reflecting head count, which was up 15% versus last year and 3% versus 3Q 2015. The vast majority of new hires continue to be engineers and product managers.","Other income and expense similarly included an unusual item this quarter. Specifically, other income and expense was negative $180 million, due primarily to the write-down of securities received in conjunction with the sale of a business, offsetting interest income from the investment portfolio.","Finally, taxes also reflect the impact of certain one-time items in the quarter affecting the U.S. rate. Specifically, taxes reflect the resolution of a multiyear audit in the U.S. as well as the full-year impact in Q4 of the U.S. Congress making the R&D tax credit permanent. Our effective tax rate for the full year, including these one-time items, was 17%.","Net income was $4.9 billion on a GAAP basis and $6 billion on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per diluted share were $7.06 on a GAAP basis and $8.67 on a non-GAAP basis.","Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.1 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.4 billion, with free cash flow of $4.3 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash and marketable securities balance of approximately $73 billion, of which approximately $43 billion, or 59%, is held overseas.","Our cash balance reflects the impact of seasonal working capital requirements and our repurchase during the quarter of approximately 2.4 million shares of Alphabet Class C stock for a total repurchase amount of $1.8 billion. Our Board of Directors recently authorized a modest increase in the size of the stock repurchase we announced last quarter. You can find the details in our earnings release of the total remaining authorization.","Let me now turn for the first time to our segment financial results. In our earnings release, we are providing key financial metrics for Google on the one hand and the combined Other Bet businesses on the other hand. I will review the results for each segment with respect to revenues, operating income, and CapEx, which I will discuss. You can also find in the release details of stock-based compensation as well as depreciation, amortization, and impairments for Google and the combined Other Bets.","As I go through the Google segment, I'll be providing the same level of detail we've presented in prior periods, both to best assist in comparability relative to prior periods and given the fact that Google continues to represent the overwhelming majority of our results. For Other Bets, I'll be discussing revenue, operating income, and CapEx for the full year. Detail on a quarterly basis is included in the press release.","Keep in mind that Other Bets represents an aggregation of businesses, many of which operate in distinct sectors with different business models. Given their stages of development, these businesses will have idiosyncrasies with respect to the timing of revenue, expenses, and CapEx resulting from milestones, partnerships, and other factors. You can expect that results for the combined Other Bets may be uneven in the near term, so it's likely to be more instructive to look at them on an annual or rolling 12-month basis to assess their trajectory.","Starting with the Google segment, which includes our Search and Ads business as well as related businesses such as Play, Hardware and Cloud and Apps, as well as our newer efforts within Google such as Machine Learning and Virtual Reality, Google revenue was $21.2 billion, up 18% year over year. This reflects the impact of FX.","In terms of the revenue detail, Google Sites revenue was $14.9 billion in the quarter, up 20% year over year, and up 14% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds. Year-on-year growth reflects substantial strength in Mobile Search due to ongoing improvement in ad formats and delivery. As I mentioned previously, we also saw the benefits of consumers' greater use of mobile for shopping during this holiday season.","YouTube revenue continues to grow at a very significant rate, driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred. Network revenue was $4.1 billion, up 7% year-on-year and up 12% sequentially, continuing to reflect the strong growth of Programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses.","Other revenue for Google was $2.1 billion, up 24% year over year and up 20% sequentially. Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also had an impact on Other revenue. Year-over-year performance was driven by Play as well as continued strong growth in Cloud and Apps.","Finally, on monetization, as a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected by currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 31% year over year and 17% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 13% year over year and 5% sequentially. In terms of the drivers within Sites, paid clicks were up 40% year over year and up 22% sequentially. Site CPCs were down 16% year over year and down 8% sequentially.","The movement in Google Sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube TrueView. Network paid clicks were up 2% year over year and up 1% sequentially. Network CPCs were down 8% year over year and up 7% sequentially. Total traffic acquisition costs were $4.1 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, up 14% sequentially and up 12% year over year.","As a reminder, the sites TAC line in our earnings release includes the TAC that we paid to search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search. Operating income excluding SBC was $8 billion, up 28% versus last year for an operating margin of 38%. Google stock-based compensation totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter, up 18% year over year. Operating income reflecting the impact of SBC was $6.8 billion, up 30% versus last year, and the operating margin was 32%. CapEx for the quarter was $1.8 billion, reflecting investments in data center construction, production equipment and facilities. Full-year 2015 Google revenues were $74.5 billion, operating income excluding SBC was $28 billion; operating income including the impact of SBC was $23.4 billion and CapEx was $8.8 billion.","Turning to Other Bets' financials, Other Bets includes efforts such as all we are doing with Fiber, Verily, Calico, Nest, self-driving cars, and our incubation activities in X. As discussed previously with respect to Other Bets, we're focused on optimizing resources across this portfolio in the near term, with the objective of maximizing Alphabet's long-term value creation. For the full-year 2015, Other Bets revenue was $448 million, up 37% versus last year. Reported revenue for Other Bets was primarily generated by Nest, Fiber and Verily.","As noted previously, the majority of efforts within the Other Bets are pre-revenue. On a full-year basis, operating loss excluding SBC was $3.1 billion. As previously noted, these results reflect the impact of project milestones established several years ago. Including the impact of SBC, operating loss was $3.6 billion. Other Bets CapEx was $869 million for the full-year, primarily reflecting investment in our Fiber business.","Let me conclude with some comments about our continuing transformation of Alphabet. As Larry articulated in the 2013 Founders' Letter, and then, again, when announcing the creation of Alphabet, incrementalism in technology leads to irrelevance over time, because change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. This belief was the impetus for our organizational structure, which enhances focus on opportunities within Google and across Alphabet, while also pushing our leaders to extend the frontier that we are addressing.","Consistent with the move to Alphabet, we expanded transparency internally regarding the expenses and CapEx required in each business, which benefited our 2016 budgeting process and capital allocation decision-making. As part of this process, we established technical and business targets for a number of the businesses to set the appropriate pace of investment. We made necessary choices to align resources with those efforts that maximize the potential for long-term value creation, prioritizing certain efforts, while making tough calls in Others.","Given the fact that we are innovating in a number of exciting industries, in some areas, the optimal execution path could encourage accelerated investment. In Others, we continue to receive interest in exploring partnerships or alternate approaches to commercializing our efforts. Verily is a great example of where we formed strategic partnerships with companies like Dexcom, J&J, Novartis, and Sanofi in order to accelerate our efforts. My main point here is that we remain on a journey, and it is still early days. We are working diligently to build additional businesses that create long-term revenues, profits and value.","Looking forward, a few observations. First, regarding revenue. As a reminder, the fourth quarter tends to be seasonally our strongest quarter, reflecting the benefit of the holidays. In addition, our GAAP results will continue to be affected by changes in the relative strength of the dollar.","Second, operating expenses. As I said last quarter, our priority remains revenue growth, but that doesn't give us a pass on a rigorous approach to expense management. We continue to invest in longer-term opportunities within both Google and Other Bets, consistent with our emphasis on pushing the frontier to adjacent areas and moon shots. Given the early-stage nature of a number of these efforts, they are likely to require additional investment prior to generating meaningful revenues.","Notably, in many ways, some of Alphabet's biggest moon shots are in Google itself, from driving the next wave of computing through machine learning, capitalizing on the shift to the cloud by enterprises, building platforms like virtual reality and pursuing the opportunities we see with the next billion users in emerging markets, you should expect Google to continue to invest in efforts to improve life for billions of people.","Third, CapEx; as we've indicated previously, the vast majority of CapEx supports Google. We view our computing capacity as a core competence and will continue to invest here given our advantages in providing efficient, secure computing to support growth in both our consumer products and services globally as well as our Cloud and Apps businesses. In Other Bets, the majority of CapEx supports the ongoing deployment of Google Fiber. We're still operating in only a few cities, but have announced plans for additional cities, which we expect will be reflected in 2016 CapEx.","Forth, our balance sheet. In 2016, we intend to align our capital structure with the Alphabet organization so that debt is held at the holding company level. That alignment would allow us to have greater flexibility as we continue to grow, including the ability to utilize debt financing, if appropriate, and consistent with our changing product mix.","So my closing comment is that we saw tremendous revenue growth across our businesses and are applying discipline as we move to implement the Alphabet structure.","I will now turn the call over to Sundar.","Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.","Thanks, Ruth. It's great to be here to talk with you all again.","Above all, our Q4 results show the great momentum and opportunity we have in mobile search and across Google's range of businesses. What's most exciting is the incredible enthusiasm for our products among consumers and our partners.","Two things show this. First, on our last call, I shared that six of our consumer products, Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, and Google Play, all have over a billion monthly active users each. I'm pleased to share that Gmail now joins those ranks, crossing that number last quarter. Of course, all of these products are very popular and continue to grow rapidly on mobile.","Second, there is incredible momentum behind the Android ecosystem, and the model is working at scale. This is a group of companies with whom we have worked really hard to build strong relationships. At the center of this are Android phones, and it's exciting to see the lineup of flagship devices our partners are working on this year. And there are newer areas, which are showing a lot of promise.","In addition to an Android web partnership with New Balance and a new smartwatch from our friends at Casio, over 40 car brands worldwide are bringing Android Auto to their cars. Dozens of partners are integrating Android TV and Google Cast technology into living room products launching this year.","I want to talk about two main things today. First, some thoughts on the approach we are taking to drive the next wave of innovation, and then, some thoughts on our advertising business and our newer emerging businesses.","First, a few words on our approach. At Google, we've always tried to bring our unique technical strengths to areas where we think we can make a big difference, like indexing the world's information to make it discoverable. We have focused a lot on really improving search in mobile and now we are investing in evolving this to actively assist our users throughout the day in smart and helpful ways. This comes thanks to our years of investments in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, knowledge graph and other areas.","And the next wave will be powered by big advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, an area where we believe we lead the industry. Just last week, DeepMind published an incredible result, the first ever to master the game of Go with artificial intelligence. An amazing accomplishment, and I'm excited for the world championship in March. And in November, we open-sourced TensorFlow, our new machine learning system, to help accelerate discovery and development in the field.","Machine learning is making our products smarter and more useful for people every day. It powers Smart Reply, in Inbox by Gmail, which suggests short responses that are relevant to an incoming email. People absolutely love this feature. In fact, in just a few months, Smart Reply already makes up 10% of all mobile responses in Inbox.","From image recognition in photos to eliminating email spam to better translation and voice recognition, our machine learning efforts are making a huge difference for people every day. In sum, we believe we've only scratched the surface of truly being there for our users anytime, anywhere, across all devices, giving them the assistance they need. We are excited to make even more progress on this vision in 2016.","The second part of our approach is to make sure we are solving big problems for everyone. We believe that someone in Indonesia should get the same quality email service or search results as someone in New York. This quarter I visited Korea, Vietnam, and India to speak with partners, developers, and students. It was a very inspiring trip. I even sat down at a local coffee shop with Dong Nguyen, the creator of the popular Flappy Bird game, which has inspired Vietnam's growing community of developers and startups to think hard about how to create worldwide hits.","From providing Internet access in India's railway stations to making Chromebooks available throughout the region, it reinforced what a huge opportunity we have to help the next 1 billion users come online and to have great experiences with the whole Internet once they are there. That's why creating open platforms that anyone can build on is core to Google's DNA, from Chrome to Android to Brillo to our latest virtual reality efforts.","It's still incredibly early innings for virtual reality as a platform, and Cardboard is just the first step, but we are excited by the progress we have seen. Our partners have shipped over 5 million Google Cardboard viewers, and we recently teamed up with The New York Times on a virtual reality experience in which over 1 million Times subscribers received Cardboard. And since launching in September, the Expeditions Pioneer Program has helped more than 500,000 students travel to places like the bottom of the sea or the surface of Mars. Beyond these early efforts, you'll see a lot more from us and our partners in 2016.","Now turning to the trends and highlights that we are seeing across our advertising business as well as some of the newer areas. It's hard to believe that AdWords just celebrated its 15th birthday. Just like Google Search and the computing devices we all use now, the product is largely unrecognizable from the first version that launched in 2000, but the key value proposition remains unchanged. Google helps advertisers reach the right customer at precisely the right micro-moment when they are looking to buy something, go somewhere, know something, or do something.","Mobile is really helping us making these connections for marketers. As Ruth mentioned, Mobile Search was particularly strong in the fourth quarter. This holiday season, we found that shopping moments replaced shopping marathons. Shoppers turned to their mobile devices to purchase gifts online in spare moments throughout the day all season long, and marketers turned to our mobile ad offerings to reach those customers.","And people are actively buying products when searching on mobile. Our research shows that 30% of all online shopping purchases now happen on mobile phones. In fact, in the U.S., looking just at product listing ads, revenue from mobile phones exceeded desktop on Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and through the weekend. Not only were people using mobile ads to shop online, they also used their phones to find the best products and prices in stores around them.","Our local inventory ads help people see if a product they are looking for is in stock at a retailer nearby. Marketers at Lowe's and Target find them useful because they can measure the foot traffic that their search ads drove. In fact, thanks to local inventory ads, Target reported millions of incremental store visits in the week leading up to Christmas.","We also continue to see great success in driving app downloads. Our app promotion offerings like Universal App Campaigns, which help marketers easily run campaigns in Google Play, YouTube, Search, and across our Display Network, are getting great traction and delivering results for advertisers. We are now seeing a trend of advertisers moving their app install budgets to Google.","Now moving to video, people watch hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube every day, and it continues to be a must-have for all brand advertisers. Not only does YouTube on mobile reach more 18 to 49-year-olds than any cable network in the U.S., but the time people spent watching YouTube in the living room more than doubled in 2015.","Brands turn to YouTube to inspire and engage potential customers. And with our recently launched Shoppable TrueView Ads, marketers like Michael Kors can connect the dots between inspiration and purchase. And it is brands of all sizes. In fact, over the last two years, the number of small and medium-sized businesses advertising on YouTube has doubled.","We also continue to expand measurement options for marketers on YouTube to help them better understand the effectiveness of their ad spend. In addition to our own measurement tools, we recently introduced support for third-party viewability vendors on YouTube.","YouTube is also a powerful platform for creators. Today, any creator can upload a video to YouTube and get discovered by over 1 billion people around the world. That global exposure has allowed YouTube and Google to pay out over $3 billion to the record industry to date.","We are also investing in the future of video. You can now watch the VR videos on YouTube, and content creators can now film in new YouTube spaces in Paris and Mumbai.","Between incredibly strong viewership growth, the move of advertising budgets to digital video, great new features, as well as the successful rollouts of YouTube Music and our YouTube Red subscription offering, I couldn't be more excited about the prospects for YouTube in the years ahead.","In programmatic video and display, we continue to see strong momentum. More marketers and publishers use programmatic automated ad buying and tools through our DoubleClick platform this holiday season than ever before. Programmatic video impressions doubled compared to the holiday season last year. And in the week leading up to Black Friday, more than 60% of programmatic impressions came from mobile devices.","Lastly, I'll discuss some of our newer business areas, where we continue to see tremendous potential. Google Play, our hub for digital content, continues to see great momentum. In 2015, spend per buyer in the Play Store grew by more than 30% globally compared to 2014. We had particularly strong growth in this area in countries like Brazil, India, Indonesia and Mexico, thanks to continued investments in payments capabilities.","On Hardware, as you know, last quarter, we launched the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P in more than 30 countries. They are truly great examples of the best that Android can offer and have gotten great reviews. And the adoption of Chromebooks continues to gain a ton of momentum, particularly in education.","Before I wrap up, I want to share some thoughts on our Cloud and Apps group. Public Cloud services are a natural place for us, so we established a business unit late last year to take full advantage of the opportunity. I'm excited that Diane Greene, a highly respected industry vet, joined to lead it. As you know, Google pioneered the Cloud at scale. Our data centers have handled the workload of Google's own products from Search to YouTube for 17 years.","We are able to take that infrastructure and computing power and optimize it for all customers. Our data centers, infrastructure, machine learning, and premium data services are leaders in the Cloud space as is our price-to-performance ratio. And we are now able to bring this to bear just as the movement to Cloud has reached a tipping point.","Businesses now see that the easiest-to-use, most price-effective and secure infrastructure can best be obtained through the major public cloud providers. Google cloud platform is already used by more than four million applications. And we recently introduced a new way to purchase and use virtual machines, called Custom Machine Types, so that clients can tailor their purchases based on the memory they need to get the best possible cost and performance.","Our business collaboration and productivity suite, Google Apps, now incorporates the best of Google's new technologies like machine learning and natural language processing. Our adoption now extends from large healthcare providers to retailers, to government. Last quarter, Catholic Health Initiatives, the nation's second largest non-profit health system with more than 100,000 employees, announced its move to Google Apps. There's great buzz at Google around this area, and we continue to heavily ramp up investment here.","I want to say thank you to all of the Googlers around the world for their amazing work, from Cloud computing, digital video, and the mobile revolution, to machine learning, virtual reality, and helping the next billion get online. Google has a front row seat on the trends that will define computing in the coming years. There is truly no more exciting place to come to work every day.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Thank you, Sundar. We will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hello, thank you for taking my questions. I have a couple. First, Sundar, do you believe there is a non-trivial chance of Google and the DeepMind team achieving strong AI in the next five years or so?","And secondly, on your revenues, can you tell us what do you feel the drivers of Sites revenue growth and what seems to be an acceleration have legs and are more like improving this experience in advertiser returns and less like increasing ad lows, which one could argue have a limited headway? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.","Thanks, Carlos. I'll answer the first, and turn it over to Ruth on the second. On AI, we are obviously seeing incredible progress in this field. We make great strides, and we start taking it for granted and look to the years ahead. It's always tough to predict what happens over a five-year timeframe, but I do see us making significant strides. Even a year ago, I wouldn't have predicted that we would be in a strong position to mount a serious challenge to the world champion in Go this year. So looking at the pace of progress, I think we will have AI in a form in which it benefits a lot of users in the coming years, but I still think it's early days, and there's a long-term investment for us.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","And then, on Sites' revenue, what the results reflect is, is product strength, geographic breadth, and obviously, the added backdrop of an active holiday season with the Sites' revenue up 20% year-on-year notwithstanding the currency impact. The way we look at it is we've got extraordinary capability and strength in Search, and then ongoing innovation across the platform.","As we talked about last quarter, we did benefit from a change made in Q3 in ad format with respect to mobile search and we do continue to benefit from that change. Mobile search growth was the biggest driver again this quarter. And then, in terms of YouTube, the momentum continues. The story continues to be about strong growth in video advertising, TrueView and Google Preferred as distinct from Display on YouTube. And then, just to round it out, desktop search remains a solid contributor as well.","Carlos Kirjner-Neto - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two on margins now that we have the new disclosure \u2013 and thanks for all of that information. With core Google, we saw a very nice operating margin improvement in 2015 versus 2014. Wanted to know if we could get a little bit color on what drove that, whether it was incremental revenue, pricing, cost efficiency, how you sort of think about what drove that? And the opposite for Other Bets, clearly, a bigger loss in 2015 versus 2014. Maybe a little bit of color on the volatility as you called it out, and how that might develop over time. Thank you.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Certainly. So starting with Other Bets, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're at the beginning of a journey with the creation of Alphabet and breaking this out into the segments is a meaningful step. As you look at some of the numbers, the reason I said it's more instructive to look at annual or rolling 12 months is that there can be some lumpy things on a quarterly basis, but we're continuing to invest across the businesses as we talked about.","So that would explain the 2014\/2015 trend here. It just underscores that we're investing in the business, we've made some tough choices, and as I said, in terms of how we're allocated across the various businesses, but an important area for us and tried to give you the sizing here in the segment information.","And then, in terms of overall Google, we're continuing to invest there as well. We're investing quite meaningfully, as I previously said, the 70-20-10 model is an instructive framework that Larry's articulated for a long time. And as I tried to stress in my opening comments, we're looking to push the frontier both within Google and Other Bets. So ongoing innovation is key to all that we're doing in Google, and it's benefiting users and the ecosystem broadly. So you're continuing to see us invest there, and notwithstanding, that you see the results that you have here today.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you. Sundar, thank you for the color on your initiatives with the Cloud, and we're all very excited about Diane Greene's hiring. I was wondering if you could share with us when you were having conversations with corporate customers over the last 12 months, what were the biggest areas of change or things that they said Google needed to work on in order to win over their Cloud business versus, say, them choosing to go with an AWS or an Azure? And can you talk to us about how that change might progress and how we might see that filter through in 2016? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.","Thanks, Heather. I'm very excited to have Diane here as well. We are already getting significant traction. It's a strongly growing business for us. And we plan to invest significantly in 2016. It'll be one of our major investment areas. In terms of talking to customers, first of all, as I said earlier, the Cloud platform is now already used and trusted by over four million applications. And a lot of it is about making sure we are very seriously committed to the space, which we are.","And in terms of wanting, there's a breadth of feature requirements, and so we've been carefully taking customer feedback and addressing all those needs. And as time goes by, I think we are getting very competitive. We have natural advantages in doing this, but we also need to make sure we address all the feature needs, and that's what we've been focused on. And I think we are at a point now where the product is ready to be used at scale. And so I expect to get significant traction in 2016.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sundar, could you talk a little bit about \u2013 provide any milestones for autonomous vehicles and Nest? They're two of the Other Bets that we're particularly intrigued by here. I know they're very long-term bets, but the milestones that you've seen that kind of give you confidence in the forward direction of those businesses? Thank you.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","So I'll take that. Those are two of the businesses that are, as we call them, Other Bets. Look, on the self-driving cars, we have an extraordinary tech team. We've been working on it for many years, and the focus is developing technology with a real emphasis on safety and understanding what it takes to build and operate fully autonomous vehicles.","We continue to make great progress. We've now driven 1.3 million miles with important data regarding the safety and utility, and that's what we're really focused on. We've got prototypes on streets in two cities. So we're continuing to execute against that and continuing to build it out.","And then, on Nest, we have now more than 14,000 developers who've joined the Works with Nest program, enabling them to connect with Nest products through the Cloud. The team refreshed the entire product portfolio in 2015. That resulted in very strong year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter revenue growth, and again, similarly, they're just executing against that business plan.","Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, Ruth.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Ruth, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail on the U.S. acceleration. It's been pretty strong four quarters in a row. Is that YouTube and Search? Any more detail on that would really be helpful if those individual businesses have accelerated. And then, on the Other Bets business, clearly, and you mentioned milestones a couple of times, the losses have really increased over the last two quarters. Could you share any of those milestones with us? Thank you.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Sure. So starting with the U.S., I think the main point is that we've had meaningful growth in all geographies, reflecting the product strength and the added tailwind of the holiday season. And looking forward, we would expect typical seasonal patterns to hold Q4. As you know well, it tends to be our strongest quarter. But specifically on the U.S., that as we talked about last quarter, really reflects the diversity of our products here. Each is doing well. Mobile growth, as both Sundar and I talked about, was the key driver yet again. But YouTube and programmatic continue to deliver strong growth, and that translates into the results that you saw for the U.S. We obviously had a nice lift from retail, no surprise given the holiday season. But I think simply put, it's the diversity of doing a lot across a lot of different products.","And then in terms of the milestones and your question regarding Other Bets, as I mentioned in the opening comments, results this quarter were affected by project milestones. Those milestones were established several years ago. And that's why I called out that it could be lumpy on a quarterly basis and why we look at it over a year, over rolling 12 months, and I'm not going to break it out in more detail than that. As Larry said, when we announced Alphabet, it's an exciting new chapter. It is about getting more ambitious things done. We're doing that in a framework to ensure we are disciplined with our resources, and this was just calling out a milestone established some time ago.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you. Sundar, you just called out Gmail as the latest among your products to reach 1 billion users. So I guess at this point, you're explicitly monetizing Search, YouTube, and Gmail to some degree, while some of the other products maybe they're a bit more nascent are still not monetized or under-monetized, it seems. So big picture as you look at the next 1 billion users who want to come online and use your products, are you in any hurry to begin monetization at all?","And, Ruth, I think since you came on board, CapEx is down basically every quarter. Granted, fourth quarter of 2014 had the discretionary real estate purchase in there, but in your budgeting process for 2016, is the nature of what you're going to be spending money on changing much at all for core Google? And in regards to the CapEx for the Other Bets, being primarily for Fiber, it seems like there are six upcoming cities and 11 potential cities. What is the green-lighting process for whether a city gets considered or not? Okay, thanks.","Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.","Great. I take a very long-term view towards this. When we look at the scale of mobile for the first time in our lifetime, so I think we have a platform which is going to reach one day the entirety of the world's population, so it will be over 5 billion users. And from our standpoint, core to our mission, we want to be in a position where we are helping users throughout the day. We are assisting users with their core information needs across all our products. And I think if we do that well, a lot of that information is commercial, and hence our monetization works effectively as well, as you've seen this year. And so very focused on long-term building that user experience to be assisting users, and that's the framework with which we think about it.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","And then in terms of CapEx, you've noted the important difference on a year-over-year basis a couple of sizable real estate items as part of our facilities expansion that we called out last year on top of continued investment in our technical infrastructure. But really to the heart of your question, looking ahead for 2016, we do expect to see accelerated investment in CapEx, and that's to support both Google and Other Bets. As we often talk about, we view our technical infrastructure as a key strategic asset for the company. We have terrific scale and efficiency, and the team has done an extraordinary job innovating to achieve efficiencies following a period of heavier investment in 2014.","So we're now delivering about three times the compute power for the same amount of power or dollars we did five years ago. And that's an important point because it explains some of the slower CapEx in 2015. But given our commitment to have the most potent infrastructure, we do expect to increase CapEx in 2016. And for Google, that is intended to continue to support growth in our consumer products and services globally as well as all that we're doing for our enterprise clients, as Sundar has already talked about, so CapEx in both areas there.","And then, in terms of Fiber and what we're doing more broadly in Other Bets, Fiber will continue to be, we expect, the biggest consumer. And again, you identified the driver of it. It obviously increases as we execute in a growing number of cities. One of the main things that also affected 2015 is the rollout was really measured as we worked to enhance the construction process and efficiency, doing things like developing relationships with cities and establishing protocol with construction partners, but we have more cities announced. And obviously, as we execute on those, that takes more CapEx as well.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the questions, two things. First, Sundar, if you could, talk a little bit about YouTube. It's been several quarters now where you've talked about the mix shift toward TrueView ads bringing down the average CPC for Sites. But can you talk about the trend that you're seeing there more on a like-for-like basis, and whether in theory that should tighten up more relative to search ads going forward?","And then, secondly, Ruth, on the core Google business, we've seen roughly 300 basis points of margin expansion here over the last year or so. I know you're talking obviously about the investments around cloud and machine learning. Do you think there is still potential there for profitability to improve in that segment? Thanks.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Let me start first on YouTube monetization. There's really no change from my comment last quarter. YouTube had very healthy revenue growth, again, driven by growth in TrueView and other video ads, but the monetization story is still evolving. It's still early innings, and we're focused on the opportunity to get larger offline budgets moved to YouTube. Given the level of user engagement globally and the compelling nature of demographics, it does remain a very attractive platform. In the near term, given the growth in viewership, YouTube TrueView CPC pricing is expected to continue to affect our overall Sites monetization mix.","And then in terms of Google and margin outlook I think is really what you're getting at, I'll go back to my prior comment. What we achieved here by pulling out the two pieces is providing, obviously, greater visibility into what we're investing within the Other Bets, but want to underscore that we continue to invest in Google. We're in early innings in many areas. And I already referenced back to the framework we use, which is to continue to push the frontier within Google as well to adjacent areas. You named one, we've talked about it on this call, it's very important, Cloud and Apps, and all that we're looking to invest there.","But we're doing more than that. It's also the moon shot areas, it's virtual reality and other areas, and these are exciting early-stage efforts. We do expect we'll be in a position to discuss in greater detail over time. I'll let you estimate the short-term impact, but we believe the investment is really important as we're enhancing the long-term potential for Google and continuing to really enrich the ecosystem.","Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just to go back to the YouTube comments you made and the progress in the living rooms and the progress of the YouTube Red, can you just talk a little bit about how you think about potentially going into more original scripted longer form content, or even licensed longer form content to go after even a larger share of offline ad budgets?","And then, secondly, the rest of world, can you just talk about what you're seeing in the emerging market CPCs on a constant currency basis? How big is that gap now between the emerging markets in the U.S. and how do you think about closing that longer term? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.","On YouTube, let me answer first on YouTube. On YouTube, obviously, the overall momentum has been great. We have over a billion users watching hundreds of millions of hours. To me interestingly \u2013 sorry. Let me answer the YouTube question first. On YouTube, we have great momentum. We have over a billion users watching hundreds of millions of hours. And in fact, 80% of YouTube's views are from outside of the U.S. It's been an incredible year where I feel the team is on fire, focusing on launching YouTube Red, YouTube Music. And as you saw at Sundance, a big push on YouTube Originals with a focus from our top creators to create exclusive content for YouTube Red users. And so I'm really excited about all the new investments we are doing there, and users are responding very positively. And so I think it's going to be an exciting 2016 for YouTube.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","And then, in the rest of worlds, it's already growing at a high rate off a large base. And we're really pleased with the ongoing progress there. In addition to mobile, we benefited from Play and our Universal App Campaigns, as Sundar said. We're continuing to invest meaningfully in rest of world. We view it as a very sizable opportunity, bringing the next four billion online and all the opportunities there. So that's really the main focus for us at this point, is continuing to build out availability, access, and products for the rest of world.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Vogel from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Just two questions. One, just going back to CPCs real quickly, if we were to normalize out both TrueView and currency, I'm just wondering, any comments on how core search is doing and just how core mobile search is doing from a pricing standpoint.","And then second, just on the CapEx side, I'm just curious how you think about utilization across all of your products? And you obviously spent a lot in the past, are we at a good spot? Do we need to spend ahead? Or is there a lot of capacity that isn't being utilized right now? Thank you.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","So in terms of CPCs, other than YouTube, I guess, the other comments to add are in the fourth quarter, we did see an impact from the ad format changes that we talked about in the third quarter. That also increased our overall click base. And we believe this click growth is a positive indicator of ads that are proving to be more relevant to users. In other words, the CPC trend reflects the fact that the denominator's growing faster than the numerator. But we do view that as a long-term upside opportunity for both CPCs and revenue. So mobile continues to be very healthy as evidenced as I tried to indicate in my opening comments and Sundar did as well. And similarly, Desktop growth remains very healthy.","In terms of CapEx, I guess, the main point is we do expect it will be increasing in 2016. I've already address that. I think part of it's you got in the way you asked the question, which is we've achieved efficiencies after this heavy spend in 2014. And that's where the team was very focused, is we ramped up spend, and then we've been focused on how to extract the most efficiency here. And that, as I said, does explain some of the slower CapEx in 2015, and the reason we've been very focused on indicating that it will be increasing to support all that we're doing. It's quite a bit of requirements on both the Google side and what we're doing in Other Bets, and Fiber specifically. So part of it was the 2014 spend and the digestion in 2015.","Paul Vogel - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you very much.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I just have two questions for Sundar. Most of them have been answered already. But on the UK, Sundar, it's now growing over 20% despite a tougher comp. And that's the most mature digital advertising economy globally. And we haven't been over 20% at Google for three-plus years. So is this mostly a function of mobile search hitting its strides?","Is there anything else that's driving that growth up? And what do you think that says about the maturity or lack thereof of digital advertising globally as we look at all other regions? And then, you also made the comment during the prepared remarks that ARPU for Play, I believe you were referring to Play is up 30%. Is that on a like-for-like geo basis? And is that a function of the personalization efforts that Google has been doing within Play? Or is that more a function of just the overall content flowing through Play evolving and maturing? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai - Google, Inc.","On the first half, when I think about growth, you're right. And as Ruth mentioned earlier, too, mobile search, YouTube, they're all working well. But I would take into account overall a secular shift to mobile, how users are adopting mobile. And on top of that, I think we're working hard to serve our users well on mobile. So it's a combination of all of that, and I think the model is working well.","On Play, to be very clear, spend per buyer is up 30%, and that's globally. And it's a function of, as you pointed out, I think we've made good strides in terms of personalizing the experience for each user. And I think that's borne fruit. But a lot of it is also improving our ability to handle payments for users and developers, and to do that better through time at a global scale.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. I think they're both for Ruth. I just wanted to make sure I was interpreting your comments correctly earlier. You talked about looking at the trendline on a trailing 12-month basis with the Other Bets losses to give a sense of the trendline. I think operating losses roughly doubled on a year-on-year basis on a trailing basis. Is that sort of the trajectory that you're wanting us to think about going forward?","And then, more of a housekeeping question around Other Bets, can you just describe what you mean by project milestones and maybe provide an example of that? And then, on the Search business, can you talk about what sort of progress that you've seen in the auction in terms of closing the gap between the average mobile CPC and desktop? Thanks.","Ruth Porat - Alphabet, Inc.","So the trend, when I talked about looking at an annual or rolling 12-month to assess trends, it was really to say that there can be idiosyncrasies on a quarterly basis that \u2013 so it leads to a lumpiness, just again, given how early-stage these are, and any particular events in one or more companies can affect the overall numbers. It was not intended to, say, take the 2014 over 2015 and extrapolate, far from it. The budgeting process that we went through was a very rigorous process. As I said my opening comments, we prioritized some, we made some tough calls, but very much with a view of having a very disciplined envelope around the way we are looking at the opportunities we have across the Other Bets. And so we look them again opportunity by opportunity.","In terms of the milestones, they can really vary for a number of things, but it would be linked to anything at the company, which, in our view, whether it's technically or from a business perspective, advances the development of the company, the value of the company, and we're not going to go into detail on each one of the specific companies. I think your second question was around Search in terms of the monetization trends in Search, and I think I've already addressed that one as well.","When I first provided color on desktop and mobile, the point is really about the health of both of them, and as I've already said here on this call, mobile continues to outperform, desktop growth remains healthy. And with all the comments that both Sundar and I made with respect to mobile, it should be clear that mobile search revenue was up significantly this quarter.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Ellen West for any further remarks.","Ellen West - Google, Inc.","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again on our first quarter 2016 call.

Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect the results. Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin are expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and restructuring. We\u2019ve also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon everyone. It\u2019s Patrick and you may remember we mentioned last quarter that Larry will no longer be joining us on a regular basis on this call as he focuses his energy on running the Company. But consistent with our prior calls, Nikesh and I will be here. We will cover the performance as well as answer any questions you have about the business, including significant ad product launches or other developments and in the case that you have a very, very detailed product related question, in some cases we may simply take it off line with you. But with that why don\u2019t we just dive into the details of our financial performance for Q4.","Our gross total consolidated revenue for the quarter was $16.9 billion and the overall business was up 17% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google segment, gross revenue grew a healthy 22% year-over-year to $15.7 billion and was up 14% quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, the Google segment revenue growth would have been 23% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter.","Our Google sites revenue was up 22% year-over-year to $10.6 billion and was up 12% quarter-over-quarter, driven by the strength of our core search advertising business. Network revenue was up 3% year-over-year at $3.5 billion and was up 12% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven in part by each year year-over-year comparisons as we anniversary some of our ad policy changes implemented at the end of 2012. But we also saw improved year-over-year growth from our ad exchange.","Finally, Google\u2019s other revenue grew 99%, almost doubled year-over-year to $1.6 billion and it was up 34% quarter-over-quarter. The digital sales of apps and content in our Play store drove the year-over-year growth in this line as did hardware sales and the Play hardware sales drove most \u2013 a big chunk of the quarter-over-quarter growth.","Turning to Motorola segment, gross revenue was $1.2 billion. As we announced yesterday Lenovo plans to acquire our Motorola business for approximately $2.9 billion. This is great news for Motorola and the Android ecosystem. And as Larry noted in our press release, Lenovo will have the expertise and the track record to scale Motorola Mobility into a major player within the Android ecosystem.","Coming back to our Google segment, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong this quarter, up 31% year-over-year, and up 13% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 11% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter. And please note that currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q4 on the cost-per-click.","Our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors discussed on previous calls, including FX, geographic mix, platform mix, property mix as well as product and policy changes.","Turning to geographic performance of our Google segment, we saw improved performance in the U.S. and the U.K. and strong performance in the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of the world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.","U.S. revenue was up 16% year-over-year to $6.9 billion. The U.K. was up 15% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, which includes a small $2 million benefit from our hedging program. So currency fluctuation had minimal impact on U.K. revenues in Q4. Our non-U.S. revenue excluding the U.K. was up 30% year-over-year to $7.3 billion. And this accounted for 46% of our total revenue, which included again a very small benefit from our hedging program, in fixed FX terms; the rest of world grew a strong 33% year-over-year.","So let\u2019s come back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $4 billion in Q4 excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.8 billion again excluding SBC and Motorola restructuring. And our non-GAAP operating profit was $4.8 billion in Q4, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 29%.","For our Google segments, specifically our traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion or 24% of total advertising revenue. The other cost of revenue was $2.8 billion excluding $127 million of stock-based compensation. And our Google segment operating expenses were $4.3 billion, again excluding SBC of $746 million.","Depreciation and amortization expenses on property, plant and equipment for the Google segment was $660 million this quarter. And Google segment profitability was $5.3 billion in Q4, resulting in a Google segment operating margin of 34%.","At Motorola, our total segment operating expenses including cost of revenue were $1.6 billion, excluding $29 million of SBC and $15 million of restructuring charges to Motorola. Keep in mind that intangible amortization expenses attributed to Google segment and Motorola segment are included in these segment measures.","Of the $279 million in consolidated intangible amortization expense this quarter, $153 million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola of which $116 million was allocated to Google and $37 million was allocated to the Motorola segment. As a result, the operating loss for the Motorola segment was $384 million in Q4 and the operating margin for that segment was negative 31%.","Our headcount for the consolidated business was up roughly 1,300 people in Q4. The Google segment added 1,700 people during the quarter and in total the consolidated company ended the quarter with approximately 48,000 full-time employees. Our effective tax rate was 16% in Q4. Tax rate this quarter was impacted by the continuing mix shift of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.","Let me now turn to cash management. Our OI&E was 125 million for the quarter. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense from our hedging program. For more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.","We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $5.2 billion. CapEx for the quarter was 2.3 billion and this quarter the majority of our CapEx spend was related to production equipment, data center construction and real estate purchases.","As I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, we continue to invest for the long term and our infrastructure continues to be a key strategic area for us to invest. Our free cash flow, in consequence of all this, was $3 billion. So there you have it, strong results and an optimism that provides us the confidence to fund strategic growth opportunities, including Android, Chrome, YouTube, Enterprise just to name a few.","Before I wrap up, I want to cover two quick things. First, I want to remind everybody as I do every time at this time of year that as we start a new year, things such as employer taxes, 401(k) and all these other related accruals tend to be frontloaded in the year. So please consider this as you model your forecast.","And second, before I hand it off to Nikesh, I want to give an update on our issuance of Class C shares. Our Board of Directors has formally approved the Class C dividend and has set March 27 as the record date and April 2 of this year as the issuance date. So we expect that Class C shares to begin trading on April 3.","We were excited to announce that the Class C shares will actually trade under our original Ticker, that is GOOG, while the Class A shares will trade under a new Ticker GOOGL. We're setting up a link on our Investor Relations site so that it can give you more information on the Class C dividends.","With that, I'll let Nikesh cover the details of our business performance in the quarter and after his remarks, we'll open up the phone lines for questions. So, here you go, Nikesh.","Nikesh Arora","Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned, our business had a strong quarter with $15.7 billion in Google segment gross revenue. Overall performance was strong in retail and automotive and CPG sectors. We had particularly good growth in Asia Pacific including its various emerging countries as well as in Southern Europe.","I want to talk about three areas that are fueling growth for Google and our clients. First, our continued efforts to help performance marketers reach customers and drive action across screens. Second, our continued progress in brand advertising. And third, our ad technology platforms used by thousands of agencies and publishers. Then I'll say a few words about new areas like digital content, hardware and enterprise.","On performance; performance advertising continues to be a mainstay of our core business. We're seeing good growth. It's driven primarily by increased search activity across all screens. It's driven by new measurement features and more sophisticated marketers are aligning their search and display advertising strategy.","Last year we made the move to Enhanced Campaigns in AdWords, 12-months in marketers tell us it helps them get results and reach people across screens in a big way. Our internal slogan for this is 'Advertisers ROIs don't lie.' We also rolled out estimated total conversion. Marketers can now measure results like calls and conversions that take place in different devices.","For example, 1-800-Flowers discovered a 7% increase in overall conversions when they figured out that conversions that start on one device then end on the other. This is a great example of our vision as it relates to the seamless multi-screen marketing and something that was impetus for us to launch in ad campaigns.","In the holiday season, one thing has become very clear. The Web has truly become the new holiday store window. It's first where people go and it's where everyone gets excited about holiday shopping. In the U.S., Walmart continues to use Google search more and more. They are investing with us more than ever before to drive sales during the holiday season.","There's also great momentum in product listing ads and we continue to improve the experience for shoppers and retailers. Last quarter, Google Shopping came to eight more countries. We even helped deliver products to your doorstep in just a few hours. Google Shopping Express, our same day delivery service, has been open to shoppers in the Bay area since last year. I'm very pleased with the feedback we've gotten from our partners and users.","Now moving on to brand marketing. Working closer and closer with brand advertisers has been a big priority for us and we're making great strides. Now you might have seen all the teaser ads running on YouTube ahead of the big game Sunday. Given my personal passion for cricket and lack of, pretty much any knowledge of American Football, I decided to turn to Google Trends and see who is leading. I see that Seahawks have more searches than the Bronco, so that's my bet for the Super Bowl. But folks in Denver better get searching if they want the Broncos to win.","I don't know what that means for the big game on Sunday, but I do know that we are becoming a central to the biggest brand-building campaigns of the world. There are three big areas of focus that brand and our agency partners really like. First, building our great content on YouTube. YouTube gives brands amazing reach and a passion of unique audience you can't get elsewhere. YouTube has over 1 billion viewers per month and saw a 50% increase in daily watch time last year.","Second, the best digital marketing captivates people when it's by the Web, for the Web. It's so much more than simply taking television ads and transplanting them on YouTube. So we're investing in creative ad formats that pivot around user engagement like CUview or engagement ads across the Web. Last year for the first time, three videos by brand marketers were on YouTube's list of top 10 videos for 2013.","Third and importantly, better measurement than enables brand and agencies to measure and optimize campaigns based on metrics like reach, recall or awareness. Last quarter we enabled advertisers in our Google Display Network start buying ads based on viewable impressions, a fancy way of saying, ads that people actually saw. In November we began testing Nielsen OCR, measurement on our YouTube and our network. There's a lot more to come here, but it's an important step to helping brands invest online.","We think our efforts are really resonating with major clients and agencies from around the world. Our sales team continues to fire on all cylinders. I'm really pleased we hired Kirk Perry as our President of Brand Solutions from Procter & Gamble. His goal is to help the largest brand and agencies in the world embrace digital marketing more and more. He speaks their language, so we hope that he'll be able to convince them that the future for brands is truly digital.","We worked with Kraft to build a series of engagement ads, showcasing brand videos, recipes and coupons for its new Fresh Take brand. That campaign was very successful and left an impressive 2.9% engagement rate in that average engagement time of 48 seconds.","Moving on to our ad technologies platforms, our DoubleClick buying tools continue to be the choice for agencies around the world, and we're really benefiting from the growth and programmatic spend. One trend we're seeing is the move towards private ad exchanges in which a premium publisher uses our technology to make ad space available to a small number of handpicked, high quality and highly qualified advertisers. This could provide a very safe, real-time environment for both brands and publishers.","The volume of compression running through our private exchanges as on average doubled every quarter over the past year. Overall, our monetization solutions like our Ad Exchange, AdSense and AdMob are helping major publishers maximize their revenues from digital advertisers. So that's our core ad business.","Let's talk about our trisect of emerging new businesses; Google Play, hardware and enterprise. Google Play continues to win the hearts and minds of people, the latest books, newspapers and magazines, 20 million songs, thousands of movies, textbooks, all access music. You can live your lives on Google Play. People love it so far. This quarter we introduced a Google Play Newsstand that brings together more than 2,000 free and paid news sources including newspapers like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times. We also introduced Google Play for education. It's a design for schools and educator proved ads as well as tools to easily set up a classroom of tablets in minutes.","We have a strong holiday season for our growing suite of hardware products. One of the things that has done really well for us is Chromecast. It continues to be a living room favorite remaining a best selling product throughout the entire quarter. We\u2019ve also been adding to the growing list of content available through Chromecast with new supported apps like Hulu plus, HBO Go and Pandora, with more to come.","Chromebooks are also seeing great momentum with eight of the top manufactures of computers now making Chromebooks, including new devices from both Dell and Toshiba. One in four devices sold into K-12 education in the U.S. use a Chromebook according to FutureSource. We\u2019ve also been seeing strong momentum in Nexus hardware with great reception for Nexus 5\u2019s. And as cars become more connected we\u2019ve recently themed up with the automotive and technology leaders Audi, GM, Honda, Hyundai and NVIDIA to form the Open Automotive Alliance.","Our enterprise business continues to grow steadily as more businesses than ever want their employees to work the way they live. We\u2019re seeing great momentum in the retail space. There is supermarket Waitrose, the clothing retailers Chico\u2019s and the fashion accessory brand Fossil have all gone Google this quarter. On the cloud platform side we announced that Google computer engine is now generally available supporting additional operating systems at new lower prices.","But before I close, I also want to give a shout out to our marketing team in particular they had really helped to drive the success of Google Play and the hardware products over the holidays. They have been able to do that through great effective advertising and creating awesome retail environments. And of course, thanks to all the Googlers and our partners for helping us to have a terrific quarter. We are not just embracing the future; we\u2019re helping to shape it. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you Nikesh. So, Jamie we\u2019ll look for your instructions to open the lines and get on to the Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Thank you. Two quick questions, Patrick, if you took your five or six major geographies for search and for each of them you plotted separately the evolution of CPCs for mobile and for PCs and Tablets, and you look at these curves from 5,000 feet, would they be mostly going up, down, flat or all over the place. And secondly, could you let us know if Google Compute Engine and Google App Engine are significant drivers of CapEx, 5% or more of your CapEx? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","All right, so let me jump by the second one first, Compute Engine - most of our CapEx right now is really driven by data center construction and machines that are actually driving both the core businesses of Google and of course App Engine, but App Engine I wouldn\u2019t describe as any of the core areas where we\u2019re seeing a ton of growth, not that App Engine is not successful; it's just when you compare it to search or other elements that kind of use a lot more capacity. ","In the case of your first question, it's very clear that we don\u2019t usually breakdown each of these geographies. But the fundamental trends are happening across the web, and in the same way. So all this issue of some markets are growing much faster which is the emerging markets, so you could see that -- you can infer that from our results obviously.","Clearly there\u2019s a shift between all those platforms whether it be Mobile, Tablet and Desktop again across the world, so you can infer that as well. Our sites versus network. The U.S. is a strong network area, everybody knows that and so, you can basically kind of from your own inference kind of pick and part these kind of elements, but they together move to actually really make the ecosystem vibrant and growing. And at the end of the day what you have to, just how did you say it? ROI\u2019s don\u2019t lie, Nikesh? So, I mean at the end of the day that\u2019s what you\u2019re pleased about. You\u2019re pleased about great results for our users that get them exactly the right answer they\u2019re looking for and great answers for advertisers. So, that\u2019s how we actually you should think about it, Carlos. Thank you for your question. Let\u2019s go to our next question, Jamie.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mark May with Citi. And Mr. May if you would check your mute button. At this time we cannot hear you.","Patrick Pichette","Why don\u2019t we go to the next question and then Mark can show back up.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.","Jordan Monahan - Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you. It's actually Jordan for Scott. I guess two quick questions, the first is you didn\u2019t talk much about Nest and so we were curious whether you were primarily interested in their design team or product or something else. And then on the other revenue line what was the contribution to the other revenue line from Chromebooks or Chrome otherwise in the enterprise?","Patrick Pichette","All right, thank you for your questions, Scott. In the case of Nest, look Nest and Google share a real common vision. Nest, both of us believe that technology should be doing the hard works so that people can get on with their lives and do great things. So our goal is really in the case of Nest is to help them scale. And bringing the resources of Google to increase their investments, reach broader audiences and then scale internationally. So, for us it's a terrific opportunity and then bring people like -- being able to attract people like Tony and Matt to the team is actually wonderful. So, that\u2019s really the context of Nest.","Your second question; let me just go back to your second question. The other revenue line. Well actually as I mentioned in my comments, the other revenue it really grew well, like just under a 100% year-over-year. If you look year-over-year the biggest contribution was actually on the Play apps and content. But quarter-over-quarter because of seasonality obviously it\u2019s hardware, but it's both the combination of Nexus 5 which was very strong for us and the Chromecast.","You got to remember that most of the Chromebooks are actually sold to other parties. So we\u2019re really a facilitator rather than, and so we don\u2019t book revenue on the Chromebooks. So that\u2019s really the puzzle, Scott. Thank you for your question. Why don\u2019t we go to the next question, please?","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities","Hi, great, thanks for taking the question. Nikesh, I just want to ask you about YouTube in particular. If you could help us understand the growth that you\u2019re seeing in terms of YouTube advertising revenue? And then secondly just on Nielsen OCR tagging, if you could give us some early market or feedback in terms of what you\u2019re seeing there and then a little bit more color on your decision to go with outside measurement rather than how you\u2019ve been doing it internally? Thanks.","Nikesh Arora","Yeah, sure. Look, I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, YouTube is one of our core advertising business, so both Search and YouTube are doing well for us around the world. It is part of a broader shift where we\u2019re seeing brand marketers and if you saw us, as I said our strength this quarter was not just from retail or automotive also from CPG. And part of our ability to get CPG customers to come and advertise with us is our ability to convince them that brands can be built on the Internet and YouTube clearly is the key player in our brand story, vis-\u00e0-vis advertisers, because they still think visually -- they still video when they think brand advertising not just text ads.","So I think YouTube is definitely a key part of our brand story, and it continues to do well. I think our teams around the world have sort of figured out how to pitch YouTube to large customers and customers are paying attention. So I think YouTube continues to do well in addition to our core Search business and people are seeing the value of YouTube vis-\u00e0-vis brands. ","In terms of the OCR tagging and our decision to do it internally versus externally I think look in the long-term what advertisers want is a third party to endorse various media.","It's very hard for us to be a media owner to be the person providing measurement against our own media. At the same time we believe there is tremendous amount of development that can be done in the space of measurement where traditional measurement has been both sort of after the fact and also has been on the very limited set of parameters. We believe we as a team can not only increase the parameters that you can measure due to the digital world we also believe that you can look at different metrics simultaneously in the dynamic way and also create new metrics for the future.","So our metrics efforts internally have been focused towards creating future metrics as well as more dynamic metrics as opposed to passive or legacy metrics. But that\u2019s work that we continue to do. We continue to work with third party, parties outside including Nielsen and other players of the industry, because we believe that\u2019s where the measurement industry needs to go, and eventually we have to work with them to get them to evolve with us in that direction.","In terms of the early feedback on Nielsen OCR tagging, I think it's sort of like, it's table stakes you have to have Nielsen OCR or some metric that is common across various media in the market for you to be, for advertisers to be able to measure your effectiveness or your relevancies vis-\u00e0-vis somebody else. And so I think what we\u2019ve done, this is just early table stakes which is sort of a comfort factor for advertisers, when they see that they can look at Nielsen OCR metrics vis-\u00e0-vis us and other people and get a sense that they are not spending their money in an unwise fashion, but I think there\u2019s tremendous amounts of evolution and development that\u2019s going to happen in this space.","Douglas Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities","Great. Thanks, Nikesh.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks, Nikesh. Jamie, why don\u2019t we go to the next question?","Operator","And we\u2019ll take a question from Mark May with Citi.","Mark May - Citigroup","I apologize about earlier. A question around Google Play; I believe today in just the App business and Mobile App business in general for Google I believe today you don\u2019t do a lot in a way of app marketing, for instance, Map - app install type advertising. First, is that true? If so, is that an opportunity for Google? And then secondly, it seems like that there is a lot of discussion in the market and dollars being put against identity-based ad targeting in addition to or in lieu of cookie-based advertising. What are your thoughts on that? And how is Google, if you think that's a positive trend, how is Google taking advantage of those new forms of ad targeting?","Nikesh Arora","Thanks, Mark. This is Nikesh. In terms of your first question in the area of app install, yes, clearly it has become a larger market recently with this whole mobility factor where everybody is trying to get more and more mobile. We have solutions. We have always had solutions as part of our AdMob product as well as our AdSense products where advertisers can use those forms of advertising towards creating app installs. And we continue to work hard to see where else in our various portfolio of services we can introduce the idea of app install. So you'll hear more from us in that area in the future. But I think you're right. This is an opportunity and we continue to work hard towards making this opportunity real, not just with our existing products but also looking at other ways that we can keep driving this. ","In terms of your question around cookies and alternatives for cookies, I think it's fair to say that there is a lot of conversation around cookies, there is a lot of stuff going on in terms of how do we continue to evolve this area of technology and make sure that we give the users more control and also make sure that users have security in terms of what data gets transferred for them right and increase the transparency. So, our teams are working on this. There are some early concepts in our teams where they're trying to see how they can \u2013 we can evolve this notion in all three parameters that I mentioned. But I think it's too early to talk about what those precise solutions are likely to be.","Mark May - Citigroup","Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks for your question. Jamie, let's go to the next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital Inc.","Yes, a few question on the Google Wallet initiatives. One, could you just talk about generally what are the problems that that group is trying to solve? Two, can you just tell us a little bit more about the structure of Google Wallet? Who runs the group, who do they report to? And then when you're talking about the number of credit cards that you actually already have in that system, can you give us any \u2013 can you help understand the quantity there? Are you measuring in hundreds of millions, tens of millions? And then separately, Nikesh, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on initiatives to improve ad attribution and measurement and specifically measuring sort of the online to offline attribution? Thanks.","Nikesh Arora","Thank you very much for those questions. I think \u2013 let me start with Google Wallet. I think the best way to think about what Google Wallet is trying to achieve is we're constantly trying to reduce the friction from somebody still doing a search to trying to actually acquire something. But then that is going from online to online, from online to mobile, from mobile to mobile or even online to offline like you referred to in your question at the end. So, the hope of our team is to make sure we reduce the friction and of course create a higher degree of security and comfort vis-\u00e0-vis the end user so they get a better experience. Now, Google Wallet is actually a team that is run by our commerce team, which works with Sridhar, who works with Larry. And I think the best way to think about is as people go more and more mobile, we're noticing a lot more people are spending time buying apps and digital content on their mobile devices and they end up signing for Google Wallet as part of their Google Play experience. So, we are seeing lot's more \u2013 lots and lots of users use those services. I leave it to you to infer how many Android users there are and how many Google Play users there are and what proportion of them as buying goods and services from us. So that gives you a sense of Google Wallet. It's definitely a number that we are very happy with and it continues to grow.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks for your question, Ben. Ben, this is a complex question. You can always refer back to the IR team for more details on this stuff. Jamie, why don't we go to our next question please?","Operator","We'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. A couple of things. We are seeing rest of world revenues accelerate. Does that have any benefit from product listing ads or some of the mobile changes you made in the platform? And maybe you could talk about how those are going? And then sales and marketing went up quite a bit in Q4. I was just wondering if that was related to Motorola. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","So why don't I take the second one and then I'll let Nikesh talk about the PLA. Sales and marketing in Q4 was actually just really tied to the holiday season. We had great momentum of the Nexus 5 and the Chromecast. And so at that time of the year we decided when we have such winner products, we would actually support them in addition to a number of other areas where we actually invest. So very, very pleased with the performance of both of those as well as Chromebooks, which have been, if you look in the press, the feedback you get is number one, number two in so many markets. So very, very pleased of actually kind of making that investment in these core products. For the PLA, I'll turn it over to Nikesh.","Nikesh Arora","Hi, Justin. Yes, to break your question down in terms of \u2013 there are two or three parts to your question. I think in terms of the growth in the rest of the world, effectively the growth we're seeing in the rest of the world is actually on our core search advertising business and it's across the board. It's across our various products. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done a lot of work in Enhanced Campaigns and trying to drive solutions from a multi-screen perspective. What we're really seeing is not a particular screen or a particular format, it's actually something which is allowing advertisers to come in and say, hey, I'd like to acquire more customers, I'd like more people on my website, I'd like more people in my store. And effectively them spending money and us helping them optimize across multiple screens how that money should be effectively spent and them measuring the ROIs and saying, this is good, I need to spend more money in this space. So, it's not a particular change in our mobile platform or any other platform, it's actually really our move towards Enhanced Campaigns, which is helping us and the strength in our core business. Vis-\u00e0-vis product listing ads, we've talked about this a few quarters ago how we are moving from 10 blue links in certain categories to more entity-level results. And product listing ads is a prime example of how it's happening effectively. We are seeing adoption. As I mentioned, we've added eight more countries this quarter. So, this is part of a continued evolution and it is adding value to both our end users, shoppers as well as store retailers. So it's clearly giving us benefit, our users benefit and obviously more relevant results, allowing merchants to reach specific audiences.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks for your question, Justin. Jamie, we'll go to our next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse","Hi, guys. So I've always thought of Motorola as an asset for Google to push the agenda for both hardware and software innovation to the OEMs. So, how does the sale to Lenovo affect your ability to do that? Also was your ownership with Motorola ever an impediment to having a closer working relationship with any of the other OEMs before? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Well, the short answer is we believe that this is a great transaction where everybody wins. I think that Motorola will find in the mature handset a terrific partner and we'll provide scale and continued really momentum on what is now done very well, which is develop world-class product. In addition to that, Motorola \u2013 let's never forget right has really strengthened our Android ecosystem and done a terrific job on that. So I think that both from a perspective of the hardware itself in the handset area as well as for the core Android ecosystem, I think that it's a real win-win for everybody. In addition to that, right, as you know from the Nest acquisition and Glass and Wearables, we continue to innovate and we continue to be committed to the hardware in areas that are kind of enterprising, promising, new frontiers and that's where actually we're focusing on. So I think all in all, quite a great story.","Thank you so much, Stephen, for your question. Let's go to our next question, Jamie.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric Sheridan - UBS","Thanks for taking the question. I guess a broader question, the long term around your e-commerce initiatives, just understanding how you envision continuing to partner more deeply with offline retailers, how PLAs play into that and maybe an update on what you've seen early days from the Google Shopping initiative in San Francisco and now it seems to have expanded into a second market? Thank you.","Nikesh Arora","I think the best way to think about it is that what is happening is over time, people are looking \u2013 when they look on the Web, they look for more and more bite-sized [ph] answers and which was the genesis of why we believe that entry level search begins to make more and more sense whether it's in travel, whether it's in hotels, whether it's in product listings, people are looking for more specific answers. And as you get mobile, you want even more bite-sized answers so that people can get the information as quickly as they want. So that sort of is the genesis of product listing ads. If you take that to its logical conclusion, that is people declaring intent that they would like something and that gives you a sense and a signal that, okay, clearly if they're looking for something, they're more than likely wanting to buy it at some point in time. So, we see our role as trying to enable the entire ecosystem across the board of retailers both online and offline to be able to provide those goods and services directly to the end user as quickly as possible with the least amount of friction. And friction comes in their ability to find it. Friction comes in their ability once they've found it to buy it. That's why things like InstaBuy exist in Google Wallet where you can have instant purchasing capability. And then of course there is the notion of gratification or once you've bought it, I want it as quickly as I can get it. So, you can see that our product initiatives are sort of triangulated across all of these things whether it's PLAs in terms of your ability to find it, whether it's payment capabilities to try and close the loop or whether it's delivery, experiments where we see how can we get it to you as soon as possible. So it's more of an open system approach. To be fair where we can help the entire ecosystem and our various partners and you can see that our teams are working really hard towards enabling this vision, but it takes time and great execution.","Eric Sheridan - UBS","Great. Thanks, Nikesh.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Eric for your question. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.","Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray","Good afternoon. You\u2019ve talked in the past about enhanced campaigns as being the most significant change to AdWords since its inception and can you give us little bit of context to -- its been rolled out for six months now, is it fully up and running, are advertisers fully embraced or at what period you think that we\u2019re going to kind of hit its stride with enhanced campaigns? Thanks.","Nikesh Arora","Hi, Gene. Yes of course. Actually it\u2019s been an year since we started talking about enhanced campaigns. And we\u2019re very happy with the progress. It\u2019s fully embraced, it\u2019s fully up and running across around the world. Our thousand and thousands of sales people around the world are trained. Our customers and advertising partners have understood that, that\u2019s the way for them to go target audiences and users and really focus in ROI metrics.","As we talked about, we will launch the notion of estimated total conversion, so we can look at -- let people think about it during the multi screen way, because more and more we\u2019re seeing that people do not distinguish the activities they conduct in one screen. So earlier we said that people usually search in their desktop and in their mobile devices when they\u2019re mobile, they do different things. But we\u2019re noticing that across any screen you get a sense of pretty much the same activity that happens, which means that advertiser should be somewhat agnostic on where they\u2019re able to reach the user, they should want to reach the user wherever they\u2019re. So our thesis has been proven right.","Advertisers are embracing it, users are exhibiting those behavioral patterns, so it\u2019s provided honestly tremendous amounts of efficiency in our ability because we don\u2019t need specialist in various screens, various technologies to kind of work with advertisers. We can have one team work with this product which our product teams have created, which makes it very, very simple and people can look at the ROIs again from spending money with us or individual economy as opposed to having to break it down in silos that doesn\u2019t need to happen. So it\u2019s been very successful. We are happy with it. It\u2019s in its full stride and the effects that you don\u2019t see is the effects we see internally in the amount of efficiency and clarity and our ability to work with advertisers and then being able to measure their ROI effectively.","Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray","Do you think it could have kind of an increasing positive impact going forward or are we kind of seen its full impact in the December quarter?","Nikesh Arora","I think the way to think about it is that if you haven\u2019t done something like this, our lives should have been extremely complex and you might have seen us de-accelerate because we would have get -- gotten sort of tripped up in our own floating. And we wouldn\u2019t want to do that because we\u2019d have to explain why one screen works better than the other screen, how is the ROI from one compared to the other. And you create an artificial differentiation or distinction which doesn\u2019t need to exist because at the end it\u2019 about users, advertisers and publishers.","Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray","Excellent. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you so much Gene for your question. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Sandler - Deutsche Bank","Thanks, guys. Just a question on, I guess, product or strategy for mobile. You guys are working on assisting users in mobile, not just answering search queries with hyperlinks as you did during the kind of PC browser era. Yet most of the data suggests that mobile users are spending pretty much all their time, summing around in apps all day. So how do you envision Google improving the mobile experience and how do you envision Google potentially controlling a purchase funnel if we stay in apps all day like you controlled it in the PC era? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Let me jump in just sort of a very high level and Ross I think that the fundamental tenant is rather than to speak about mobile and only mobile. It\u2019s really living with the user. And once you think through living with the user, supporting our users across all their day, whether it would be on a TV, whether it would be on a mobile phone, whether it would be on the desktop, whether it would be on with Google Glass wearables, that\u2019s really the aim that we\u2019re actually shooting for. And if on -- if it happens that on mobile they spend some of their time on apps, right, that\u2019s just one portion of the puzzle.","But when you\u2019re looking for the question, the answer and actually getting you to the real assist across your day, not then just what the devices you\u2019re on, what\u2019s your question or what should we assist you. I think it\u2019s the real question to answer and I think that\u2019s a much broader and a much richer set of the opportunities for us rather than just to be cornered into one. So I kind of defend the premise of your argument, because I think it\u2019s -- I mean our agenda is so much richer and so much more exciting for us, when you think about it in the way we just did it. So that\u2019s the way to think about it. Thanks for your question nonetheless. Let\u2019s go to our next question please, Jamie.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities","Thank you. I have two. First on local advertising, I'm curious about Google Maps, Google Ways. Monetization of local, our geotargeting based products helping local advertisers to drive ROI and what you guys need to do to drive that business in terms of advertising real-time locally? Then the second question, maybe for you, Nikesh, you mentioned the NFL jokingly, I wonder with the growth of YouTube as a platform when you look at the birth and the growth of Chromecast, why is it that you wouldn't find professional content or sports content strategic or useful in terms of driving the next leg or era of growth and monetization for YouTube? Thanks very much.","Nikesh Arora","Let me answer two different parts of it. First is, in terms of your question on local monetization. So, I think we\u2019re clearly experimenting with new ad formats in Google Maps. But I think there is a broader way of thinking about local. It\u2019s not just about app, it\u2019s about location. And as the world begins to interact across multiple screens, you begin to look at location in a whole different way because you\u2019ve a better understanding of where users are and how you can use that as a filter to provide them more precise information and hopefully, much more relevant advertising, which requires both ends of the spectrum. It requires us to understand the users\u2019 location, but also requires the advertisers to make sure they give us the location of where their services are best utilized.","So we need location extensions from advertisers, we need locations from users, and we have to be able to marry them across not just Google Maps, but all across pretty much every experience that we\u2019ve, whether it\u2019s search, whether it\u2019s anything, whether it\u2019s YouTube, whatever service that the end-user is using, we\u2019ve to be able to localize it, because location is a great filter and allows us to make things more relevant both from advertising and from an organic perspective. In terms of YouTube, I think we are very happy with the growth that YouTube is having and has had both from a user perspective as well as content provider perspective and as well as from monetization perspective.","In terms of content providers, we talk to content providers, large and small across the entire spectrum, because we want you to use the platform where creators of any size can build an audience. They can build an audience of scale; fans can find the content that they want. It\u2019s hard to comment on a particular piece of content because it starts a whole season of conversations. But we\u2019d welcome any content on YouTube as long as people felt that it would add value to the end users and as long as there is a right economic model associated with it.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities","Okay, thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you for your question. Great question again. Jamie, let\u2019s go to our next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.","Kevin Potterton - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is Kevin on for Mark. Just wondering, are you guys seeing Nielsen OCR measurement pushing more brand advertisers towards YouTube?","Nikesh Arora","Thanks, Mark. Sorry, this is Kevin. Sorry. Thanks, Kevin. Kevin, as I mentioned earlier, we had a long spirited answer on measurement. We\u2019re seeing measurement as, table stakes for brand advertisers because they want to understand what is the return of their brand spend. Now it\u2019s easier in performance advertising because you can see the number of clicks you get in your website or you can measure the number of people who walk into your store.","On brand it\u2019s a different metrics. We want to actually try and understand how many people were you able to reach of a certain age, certain gender and that\u2019s what Nielsen OCR allows you to do. It allows you to compare it across the various brand media. So its sort of access table stakes and as I said earlier, it is the early set of metrics that are sort of basic entry metrics into this space.","But we hope that this market is going to evolve from a measurement perspective over the coming quarters and coming years where we can have more sophisticated metrics and metrics that actually allow you to see the impact of this advertising on your brand.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks. Let\u2019s go to our next question please, Jamie.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Richard Kramer with Arete Research.","Richard Kramer - Arete Research","Thanks very much. Patrick, you\u2019ve talked before about projects like Google Fiber needing to make returns and you see acquisitions like Nest getting replaced by disposals like Motorola. And you\u2019ve now passed the $50 billion mark in terms of net cash. So do you have any plans this year to address this sort of mounting cash pile and as a part of the Google business that that needs to generate returns like the other businesses? And then for Nikesh, you surely seen the various social network and messaging peers absorb some substantial volumes of advertising spend. How does that make you think about the evolution of Google+ and YouTube and some of the other social platforms you have as a complement to the search based business? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","So, I will jump on the first one. As I\u2019ve reiterated many times before and we were with our Board yesterday at the Audit Committee reviewing this issue, and so it clearly -- the cash position of Google is seen as a strategic asset. It is an important asset to us both in terms of offensive and defensive, given the world in which we live in. And in that context, it's been reviewed regularly and we make sure that actually we get the best return for our investors on that asset as well. So, we have a real strategy for that as well. So, for now we have nothing else to announce on it but just to give comfort to our investors that we do take this issue seriously and it is reviewed on a regular basis by both ourselves, management, but also raised to the Board for the right answer. So, thanks for the question. Thanks for asking. It is always there. I'll turn it over to Nikesh for the second part of the question.","Nikesh Arora","Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Richard. Let's see \u2013 yes, I guess your point, yes, there are other people who are beginning to absorb some amounts of digital ad spend. I think the $15.7 billion for this quarter was a majority of this being advertising, I still think we have a substantial advertising spend coming into us. But again, from a longer term perspective, I think every piece of advertising becomes digital. So, we're still at single \u2013 I think at low double digit numbers in terms of how much ad spend is digital versus non-digital. So we need more people in the digital space getting more and more advertising to shift from what we call traditional old media. I think over time television becomes digital, I think every piece of advertising becomes digital because this provides so much efficiency from a measurement perspective and a targeting perspective to take out a lot of waste out of the system. So, with that in mind, I think we're still in the very early days of how much advertising is going to move over to digital media. And I think you're right to identify that, places like Google+, places like YouTube are still very, very sort of in their infancy in the amount of advertising they can support vis-\u00e0-vis the amount of usage we're getting. So we continue to work hard. We have to strike the right balance between user services, end user service and the amount of advertising we have presented them, because this continues to be sort of evolving space and what you don't want to do is you don't want to overrun users with tremendous amounts of advertising, because that maybe good in the short term but creates a bad experience with users in the long term. So, you will notice that many of our products still do not have tremendous amounts of advertising because we still believe those products are evolving and the right form of advertising just hasn't been invented for those particular areas. So, we remain hopeful in the long term for finding more and more ways of enabling advertising for users. And for sure, perhaps some of the products may not lend themselves to advertising and users will prefer to pay for an ad-less product as it relates to certain areas like applications or digital content, et cetera. So, those models also exist out there. So I think there is tremendous amounts of scope in the future and I think you have rightly identified some of the areas where we should be concentrating.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks for your question. Let's go to our next question please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. I was just wondering if you could share with us your strategy to try and reduce fragmentation of Android. And is the sale of Motorola a potential catalyst for this to start to happen? And ultimately, do you think this even matters over the long term? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Well, again, Heather, certainly the transaction with Motorola continues to support the ecosystem. So in that sense, right, I think that we have clear objectives of support. We've always had clear objectives to support all of our partners. And after this transaction, it's very clear that we'll continue to be kind of this impartial supporter of the entire ecosystem. As it relates to the detailed fragmentation, we've taken a number of steps. We've talked a lot about this already in the past. There is a number of steps taken to make sure that in fact there isn't fragmentation and I'll just encourage you to kind of circle back to both of what's written as well as circle back to the IR team for more of the details. But we've done a lot of progress already on this over the last kind of 18 months and a lot more to come. So thanks for your question.","We have time for one more, so why don't we jump, Jamie, to the last question of the afternoon.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great. Thanks. Just a question on enterprise. Obviously, from a SaaS perspective you already have a very good business. But in terms of the infrastructure and platform services, can you talk about how you're approaching the go-to-market? Whether it's based on pricing since there are low margin competitors already in the market or is this more of a broader platform approach to link the services together? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Nikesh?","Nikesh Arora","Thank you, Colin, for your question. I'm still trying to parse your question. Look, I think we've done really well from an enterprise perspective. We are steadily growing revenues on our traditional Google apps business. Outside of that on the platform service, the Google Compute Engine, Google App Engine stuff, we continue to make progress. I think we should \u2013 we have more room to work harder over there. We understand there are other players out there, but again that is such an early, early stage in that market. We think over the long term, almost every business out there, existing and new, has to be on a cloud platform, has to be on a large scale industrial strength infrastructure platform and there is still few players out there and there's lots and lots of room. So I'm not sure if price is the current factor on which people need to make a decision. People will make a decision based on robustness, based on security, based on availability, based on the breadth of services we can offer in that platform and I just think its early days. So, we should be working on all those things and you should be hearing more from us in the future.","Colin Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thanks for that. So, in closing, a couple of points. One is, welcome to 2014 everyone. Having closed down 2013, we're totally excited by this coming year. And just as Nikesh had said at the very beginning, thank you for the people in the financial community for your support as well as to our Googlers, partners, I mean the amazing people that make our job, Nikesh and my job so easy to be on this call because of their superstar performances across all of our products and our markets.

The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.google.com.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Ellen. Hello, everyone. I want to say at the outset that this quarter, Google turned a strong performance, and this despite substantial currency headwinds. As we have all seen, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, which resulted in a gross negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.1 billion for the quarter.","Even after the significant benefits of our hedging program, the net impact to our gross revenue was still $795 million. If these currency trends persist, FX headwinds would obviously continue to impact our results in 2015. So for our results now, our gross total consolidated revenue was $17.3 billion, growing 12% year-over-year and declining 5% quarter over quarter.","Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth is in fact a healthy 17% year-over-year. Despite significant FX pressure, Google site revenue was up a healthy 14% year-over-year to $11.9 billion and was down 4% quarter-over-quarter. Once again, strength in mobile search was the key driver of growth here.","Network revenue was up 1% year-over-year at $3.6 billion and down 8% quarter-over-quarter. As I mentioned last quarter, our network businesses includes two businesses with two different growth profiles: our legacy AdSense business and our newer display and programmatic business where the latter continues to perform quite well.","This quarter, we reclassified some revenues, primarily related to double-click ad serving software from the other revenue to network revenue line. This reclassification increased network revenue by approximately $130 million in Q1 and decreased other revenue by about the same amount, or the same amount. The display and programmatic business, as I mentioned earlier, continued as always to be reflected in the network line. To see the impact of this re-class on historical periods, please see the earning's slides on our IR website.","Finally, Google's other revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $1.8 billion and was down 2% quarter-over-quarter. It was driven really by year-over-year growth by the Play Store, offset by declines at Nexus and what I have mentioned the FX impact. Our global aggregate paid clicks were up 13% year-over-year, down 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate CPCs were down 7% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter. And on our monetization by property, Google sites paid clicks were up 25% year-over-year, down 3% quarter-over- quarter. Google sites CBCs were down 13% year-over-year and down 3% quarter-over-quarter.","Network paid clicks were down 12% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter, and network CPCs were up 2% year-over-year and down 11% quarter-over-quarter. As you know, we don't usually break down the impact of the individual factors on the quarterly changes in our clicks and CPCs. But this quarter, I want to provide more color on what's happening within our sites, clicks, and CPC metrics so that you can better understand the dynamics of the underlying businesses that drive them.","So many commentators are incorrectly assuming that the growth trends in our sites, clicks, and CPCs are primarily due to difficulties monetizing search on Mobile, but that's in fact not the case. Remember that sites metrics includes clicks and revenues related to ads served and Google's and on properties, most notably, obviously, Google.com, but as well as YouTube, engagement ads like TrueView, where users choice not to skip an ad is counted as a click.","While over the past year, we have seen YouTube viewership claimed dramatically both in established markets but also due to rapid expansion in emerging markets, and quality improvements in the TrueView ads mean that more users are in fact choosing not to skip them, increasing the overall ad view.","So this means that there is much higher volume of TrueView ads being seen, which has been a significant driver of year-over-year growth in numbers that you have seen in site's clicks. True view ads currently monetize at lower rates than ad clicks on Google.com, but as you know, video ads generally reach people earlier in the purchase funnel and so across the industry, they tend to have a very different pricing profile than they would have on a typical performance search ad. Excluding the impact of YouTube TrueView ads, growth in site clicks would be lower, but still positive, and our CPCs would be healthy and growing year-over-year. So really, we have two positive stories to tell here today.","First, as I mentioned earlier, we're experiencing real strength in mobile search, and the CPCs in core Search business is continuing to grow year-over-year, so it's doing very well. Second, viewership in YouTube videos and TrueView ads are growing significantly and YouTube's contribution to our advertising revenue continues to grow at a strong rate year-over-year. And we're really pleased with how the YouTube business is progressing. So that's the story.","Turning to geographic performance, you'll see in our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of the world, and show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.","So despite large currency headwinds, as I mentioned, we saw solid performance for our core Advertising business all around the world. The U.S. was up 11% year-over-year to $7.4 billion. The U.K. was up 6% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. And in fixed FX terms, the U.K. actually grew 12% year-over-year. Our non-U.S. revenue, which excluding the U.K., was up 14% year-over-year to $8.2 billion, accounting for 47% of our total revenue. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of the world grew a solid 24% year-over-year.","Now let me turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion for the quarter, or 22% of total advertising revenue. Our non-GAAP other costs of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q1, which excludes SBC. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $5.4 billion, again excluding stock-based compensation.","As a result, our non-GAAP operating profit was a healthy $5.7 billion, and non-GAAP operating margins, 33% in Q1. Headcount was up just over 1,800 people in Q1. In total, we ended the quarter with approximately 55,400 full-time employees at Google. Our effective tax rate was 22% for Q1.","Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expenses was $157 million. Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging programs. For more details on OI&E, please do refer to the slides that accompany this call on the IR website.","We're pleased with our strong operating cash flow at $6.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $2.9 billion. This quarter, most CapEx spend was related to first product, production equipment, data center construction and facilities, in that order. Clearly, our computing capacity is a strategic asset for us and that's why we're investing in it. But we innovate there, just like we do everywhere else. To give you an example, compared to five years ago, we can now deliver more than three times as much compute power for the same amount of power or money. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $3.7 billion. So once again, strong results in the core business as evidenced by our 17% fixed FX revenue growth this quarter, and solid margin. Now I would like to turn it to Omid to provide you more specifics on our successful performance of our core and new businesses, and then we'll turn it over to questions. Omid?","Omid Kordestani","Thank you, Patrick. Our teams turned in a great performance across our business this quarter. I thought I would switch up our typical format a bit this time around. So I'll quickly share some highlights, and then I want to talk more about growth areas that we are really focused on, mobile and branding.","Let's start with the rise of programmatic ad buying. It's an extraordinary change for the ads industry, and I want to point out that our investments in the DoubleClick platform continue to be a big positive for us. We recently made TrueView our skippable ad formats on YouTube, available through our DoubleClick suite, and we brought Internet-delivered TV content to our Ad Exchange through M Dialogue, a company we acquired last year.","Google Play is also growing fast, connecting developers and content providers with more than 1 billion people on Android devices around the world. Developers are building thriving businesses in our platform, and in February, we announced that over the past 12 months, we paid more than $7 billion to developers. We're honored to be partnering with them.","Our partner hardware ecosystem is also doing great. LG Watch, Urbain and Huawei Watch recently announced new Android wear devices, and Pioneer launched in-dash car units compatible with Android auto. Also, 10 top computer OEMs are now making more than 35 Chrome devices, available in 38 countries, so they're great momentum for us.","Google for Work continues to grow at an impressive pace, thanks to the addition of customers like G4S, one of the world's largest private-sector employers, who move 70,000 of their employees to drive for work. Working with our partners, we also recently launched android for work to accelerate the general adoption of android devices in the work place. Business is going great in these areas, and we continue to invest to capture the potential we see for growth.","Now I want to talk more about the two areas were a see a lot of opportunity for us. First, the shift to mobile, and then the trend of TV budgets shifting to digital. Mobile devices are driving the huge shift in the way people consume media. You've heard about the trends many times. Here is our point of view. As we all know, consumers reach for their phones a lot, and some of these moments matter more than others, like when people are looking for answers or making a decision about what to buy or do.","For example, more than eight in 10 smart phones users use their phone one to research a product decision they're about to make in a store. These moments include small things like looking for a movie review, and really big decisions like researching a new home purchase or figuring out what car you want to buy next.","So people expect to get exactly what they want, when they want it. As a company built on intent and immediacy, that's good news for Google. Our job has always been to connect people with what they are looking for in the exact moment they are looking. Our ad products are a critical way we've delivered the right answers and the right moment, and it's something we do really well. It's often more valuable to know someone is shopping for a new SUV than it is to know basic demographic information about them.","We have great opportunities in mobile with some of the most popular mobile apps including the Google app, YouTube, Gmail and Maps, and our great android platform. Search is also important to the mobile experience. We have re-tooled our search engine for mobile, providing direct answers enabling voice queries. It's really a delightful experience. Try opening the Google app and asking what's the plot of the Godfather movie or flip a coin. You will be pleasantly surprised.","Chrome for mobile is also a popular app with more than 400 million users and, of course, a large number of people use it as a primary way to search the web. We continue to invest in proving the mobile web for both users and developers. In the recent chrome release, we made it easier for users to add their favorite sites to their phones home screens and get helpful opt-in notifications from sites they visit often.","We've also been working to index apps just as effectively as we index web content. We now have 30 billion links within apps indexed. And if you're looking for information that lives within an app that you don't have, we'll now begin showing links to install the app right under the searches all page. The Google app on android can also give you up-to-date \u2013 can also keep you up-to-date by servicing information from more than 40 different apps when it's relevant, like Pandora music recommendations on your commute, or a car to request a lift when you arrive at the airport.","We are also working very hard to make our products more accessible to the next billion people who are coming online. The first computing experience for these users won't see on a desktop machine or a laptop. They will be on a mobile phone from day on one. In fact, many of them will use a mobile device as their only computer. We launched android one, a new family of high quality, low-cost smart phones in Indonesia and the Philippines this quarter, making it available in a total of six emerging markets.","We're also working to eliminate the barriers to access from connectivity issues. For instance, in countries like India, where a user might have a slow wireless connection, we can deliver a fast loading light version of search so they can get their answers quickly and pay less for data. And with the chrome app for android and iOS, our data compression features help reduce data usage by up to 50% while browsing the web. There's tremendous upside to these efforts, and we're in a great position.","I'm also very excited about how we're helping marketers succeed in this mobile world. As I noticed earlier, we're connecting brands with the right people at the precise moment when it actually matters because of our strong, intense signals. Mobile also enables us to help drive the 90% of commerce that still takes place off-line, which is a massive opportunity that are partners are really excited about.","People are searching on Google for things like near me, closest, and nearby, twice as much as they did last year. Our local inventory ads are a great way for businesses to drive purchases in stores right when people are looking for local options. We also help advertisers better measure the store visits that their digital ads drive, and we recently expanded the capabilities to advertisers in new countries. Our ads are also driving people to download apps precisely when they are looking for them.","Our ad mobile ad network offers great targeting and reach and is the foundation of our app install offerings. Last month, we also introduced ad promotion video ads and extended app install ads to our mobile Google display network, which increased install volumes for early testers by an average of 28% without impacting cost for install. We also recently began testing sponsored search results within Google Play with a small set of users and developers, helping ad developers reach valuable users directly within the store.","So I am very excited about the Mobile future, and marketers are, too. Our pivot to mobile has great momentum and is delivering strong benefits to users and advertisers. I also feel very excited about the trend of video content and TV budgets shifting to digital. YouTube is the world's most popular video service on all screens, with hundreds of millions of hours watched on YouTube every day. The place where 1 billion people come to watch video is a natural home for video advertising budgets. When people come to YouTube, they come the intent of watching video, so it's the perfect time to reach them with a video ad, not when they are distracted by something else. More and more, brands are seeing the value reaching audiences on YouTube two, with the number of TrueView advertisers growing by 45% in 2014.","YouTube drives great results, and we can measure the impact. We have run over 6,000 brand live studies to date across some of those largest brand advertisers, and in studies we have run for Google preferred campaigns, we found that 94% of the campaigns we studied drove a significant lift an average of 80% in ad recall. That's why we're bringing it back this year and expanding it to more than 10 new markets. Google Preferred is also attracting some of the biggest TV advertisers to YouTube. More than 30 major brands that have never advertised on YouTube before signed on with Google preferred and saw such great results that they have continued to advertise with YouTube afterwards. YouTube is home to great content and engaged audiences, and we're seeing the natural shift of TV budgets.","So those are some of my observations on the trends affecting our business, what I'm hearing from partners and why I'm upbeat on the opportunities ahead. You will see a lot more at our brand cast up-front in Europe next week at the AdWords performance Summit in early May and our I\/O developer conference in late May. We look forward to seeing you there. Before I go, I want to thank all the Googlers worldwide for a great quarter, and I want to say a special thank you to Patrick, who has been our fearless CEO from almost seven years and who wrote one of the most heartfelt and awesome retirement notes I've ever seen. If you have read it, you'll know that he was inspired to move on after climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. I've since then traveled to Kilimanjaro for all Googlers recommending local deals near their homes.","Patrick, you will be dearly missed. We wish you and your wife all the best on your new venture. Thank you. And, Ruth, if you are out there listening, we can't wait to begin working with you soon. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Omid, and absolutely true for Ruth as well. Candace [ph], why don't you give us the instructions to turn on the Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from line of Carlos Kirjner of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Carlos Kirjner","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. First, our research has suggested that many or maybe most mobile websites and mobile apps are still in pretty bad shape when it comes to user experience and conversion. I think one can expect these to improve over time. The question is, is an improvement in conversion rate and experiences within mobile apps, where users transact good or bad for Google? One could argue that people are going to spend more time in apps, transacting apps and not search. How should we think about that? Secondly, it's been more than two years since when we've seen the capital intensity very high. It continues to be quite high with $2.9 billion of CapEx. Is this the new normal? Is that what should we expect going forward? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Omid, do you want to take the first one? I'll take the second one.","Omid Kordestani","Sure. Thank you, Carlos, for the question. We are actually very excited about improvements of these mobile websites. And we really are happy to see where we can deliver the best answers to our users whether it be through an app or whether we find it on the web. We're working with developers, webmasters, publishers really serve their content to users in the format they feel best and we also recently introduced this install app, Install Carousel, which is evidence of that effort. So it's really about delivering the right results for the users and the less friction you have there and the more targeted you are, we'll see the benefits and monetization.","On the other side, Carlos, on the CapEx side. We are far from surprised from these numbers internally. Part of our plan, we are shifting as you know, we've been building a lot of data centers over the last 18 months. And so that is actually giving us the opportunity to put in new equipment in. And we are jumping on the opportunity. Thinking through the total cost of ownership of these things and the much more higher efficiency of these new machines. Having said that, I won't kind of comment about future, but I just want to reemphasize that we are not surprised by these numbers. To us, actually, they make sense given our strategy. And they really fuel all the innovations that we have going for us. So it's an important part of our strategy. It's a strategic asset.","Carlos Kirjner","Thank you.","Omid Kordestani","Thanks, Carlos, for your question. Candace, let's go to our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Mark Mahaney","Thanks, Patrick. Thanks for all the additional color on the paid clicks and the CPCs. So just so we step back a little bit because there are many of us who thought it really was driven mostly by mobile. Is there a point to your assertion that these real major shifts that we've seen over the last two or three years in CPC pressure has really largely been driven by you YouTube true views in the adoption of that? Is that kind of the point you're making? And if you would \u2013 in the past, you always listed the factors that would cause the shifts in pay clicks and CPCs. Could you just check off what the other items are, and put them in order of priority. What's moving those two wheels? Take you.","Patrick Pichette","Yes, Mark. Thank you for your question. And in fact, that's why I made the comments I made today. I'm just talking about the situations as we have it now. I'm not looking back to prior years, I'm just saying what we have seen in this quarter and the last quarter. We're just seeing a real acceleration at YouTube, and that's why we thought it was important because we saw this change.","From the fundamental kind of strong performance of YouTube, both in terms of its coverage and in terms of the performance, like even the TrueView ads, right? We tuned these ads to make sure that people want to watch them so that they are very effective, and when they do, then people watch a lot more of them. And so over the last quarter, over the last couple of quarters, we've seen the real takeoff and then the geographic expansion is kind of giving us a lot more coverage.","So it's a real positive story for YouTube, because we see it now, we're reporting now. So it's not a view back to the last five years at all. I just wanted to kind of clarify that. So thank you for your question.","Mark Mahaney","Okay. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Candace? Let's go to our next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Douglas Anmuth","Thanks for taking the question. Omid, I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more on the mobile search changes that are taking place. Talk a little bit more about what you think the key factors are here and the key differences, and whether that impact is an actual result of actual monetization. And then, Patrick, just on the margins and costs in the quarter, non-GAAP operating margin is basically flat from a year ago, so trying to understand how much you think that was a factor of one-time items a year ago, or a change at all in terms of your view on cost discipline within the business? Thanks.","Omid Kordestani","Thanks, Douglas. So with mobile phones really becoming such a primary way people search the net. Our goal is really to help people search, find the content that's not just relevant and timely but also really easy to read and interact with on these smaller devices and smaller screens. And it's important to note that this is just one of over 200 signals we use to evaluate the best results.","Non-mobile friendly sites won't disappear from the mobile searches. They'll still rank high if they hold great content that the user wants. But the lack of mobile friendliness is a problem for web publishers, because that is abandon the websites and that's a real issue. So really early to speculate exactly how the monetization impact of these organic algorithm changes will be. But we always start with the user to deliver the right answer, the best answer, be it on the mobile web or the app. And that we think that ultimately that's good for publishers, advertisers and our users and the monetization success will follow.","Patrick Pichette","Great. And so, Douglas, on my side, if you look at it, I mean, we're really pleased with Q1. If you look at the operating profit of the company, right? Despite from Q4 to Q1 revenue trends that are always seasonal, we delivered essentially the same $5.7 billion of non-GAAP operating profits for the quarter. So we're really focused on our sequential performance rather than what happened a year ago, and there was no real specific one-time items in this quarter. This was a pretty clean quarter. We're very happy with it. Thank you, Douglas for your question.","Douglas Anmuth","Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Candice, let's go to the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Brian Nowak","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just go back to your comments on splitting YouTube out from the CPCs and paid clicks, you mentioned paid click growth would be lower excluding YouTube. Would you be willing to help us understand that growth rate \u2013 what looks like now, what it looked like a year ago? And on the CPCs, you mention the search CPCs continue to grow. Is that true even including migration into emerging markets where CPCs are lower and in the shift towards Mobile?","Omid Kordestani","So we don't \u2013 look, I, what I wanted to do today's clarify the issue between YouTube and our kind of.com properties rather than to go into all of the details. You've seen in my notes of my comments that the impact of TrueView and site CPCs, site CPCs would be growing, a right, if you kind of take out the TrueView ad impact. And I've also noted that mobile search is continuing on the path of strength.","So from that perspective, what I wanted to make sure of is that you get the color that if you just exclude the great growth of YouTube, but it has very different kind of fundamental dynamics, that the core of what is typically search performance both on Mobile and Desktop, the combined, is doing really good, and the CPCs would be growing if you take the effect out. So that's really what I want to make sure of, so people don't continue to hound on this issue. Is more about mobile that has terrible monetization. In fact, there's a good story there, too. Thank you for your question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Ben Schachter","First, Patrick, congratulations on a great run at Google and enjoy the future bike rides. A couple of questions. Can you talk about how you think Google Wallet needs to evolve to better compete with ApplePay and others? Are you beginning to see acquisitions in that space or will it be more organic? And then Patrick, any updated thoughts on how Google is viewing its cash balances? Are you going to return some of that cash before you leave? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","It's all \u2013 the easy answer is really for Omid, so let him take that one and then I will talk about the cash issues.","Omid Kordestani","Sure. On ApplePay, again, I think it's just really great that the industry is really opening up here and that the merchants, the banks, consumers, are all starting to experience this. And our focus is really to bring this set of new APIs for payments, and call it Android Pay, and that our goal has always been to remove much of the friction that our users encounter today on everyday shopping experiences. And so we're excited about what the industry is doing here and what the user adoption is going to be kind we're working with all the partners to put all the pieces together and finally create the momentum that we are all looking forward to benefit from.","Patrick Pichette","And on my side, Ben, I have no news on the cash issue. I will just reiterate what I've said many times, because I think that not only is it true, but it's important, that we do bring this issue to the attention of the audit community, the board; there are regular debates about this issue. And it's a balance between cash being the strategic asset and then the question that we ask ourselves also in our conversations and deliberations is do we have a pipeline of opportunities that would make us believe that we would actually widely invest this kind of money, and in that sense it's very clear that the debates we're having will continue, but we have no further updates for you on that issue.","Ben Schachter","Good luck in the future.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Ben. Will go to our next question, Candace.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you for the question and congratulations, Patrick. I just wanted to follow up on your YouTube comments earlier. You talked about the growth you've been seeing in particular over the last couple of quarters. I'm just wondering when you are talking to advertisers, kind of what's changed over the last year or so that you really think has caused this acceleration and kind of click volume that you are seeing, and how do you think about that gap and the potential for that gap to close over time with what you see in just traditional site CPCs, if you will? Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","So I'll take the technical side of it, and then I will let kind of Omid give you more on the color of what's exciting at YouTube. Related to the question, and the answer I gave you, the comments I gave you today, it's really about if you think about it, about coverage rather than the new product, because we've done a lot of geographic expansion of YouTube, and that in itself gives you a lot more volume out there in terms of eyeballs.","And then in addition to that, we've through the great work of the team and the AdWords team and the YouTube team, the monetization team, making sure that a TrueView is a more efficient product where people, basically they actually do watch the entire ad, and so they don't skip the four to five seconds. And all you need is given the scale of YouTube today, right, all you need is to have a product that people want more and it actually delivers a lot more value.","So in terms of advertising total revenue. The fact that it's at the top of the funnel clearly has very different dynamics than when you have a very specific performance based ad that is tied to very specific high-margin query. But that doesn't mean that it's not incredibly useful for advertisers, because that's where they start is at the top of the funnel. So these are all the pieces of the puzzle that we have going for us. And for what's really exciting about YouTube, I will let Omid kind of give you more color comment on this.","Omid Kordestani","Hi, Heather. First of all, I invite you to come to Grant Cast next week, I'll be there in New York, and you'll get a sense of the momentum in YouTube. But really the way we look at it is as usual, we first look at the users. One third of all people on the Internet are everyday watching, hundreds of millions of hours on YouTube. This is generating billions of views. And then when we look at our advertisers, they want to be there. So we're seeing a strong growth in TrueView with new advertisers. The number grew 45% in 2014. And all of the top 100 global brands have run TrueView ads over the past year.","And as they are experiencing success, for example, with Google preferred, I think I shared this stat earlier, but 95% of the preferred campaigns that we studied drove a significant lift, an average of 80%. And then more than 30 brands that were new to advertising on YouTube use Google preferred, and then came back and continued to advertise with us afterwards. So just having great success.","Patrick Pichette","So, Heather, it's a good story all-around. We are pretty pleased by it, obviously. Thank you for your question. Candace, we'll go to our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Your line is now open.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the questions, and I will echo the sentiment, congrats, Patrick on the decision, and best of luck going forward. My questions is more around mobile. I appreciate all the color around the clicks and that CPC, but maybe you could talk a little bit either qualitatively or quantitatively about the way in which mobile advertising, especially search, is evolving overtime and whether some of the gaps that we used to talk about one or two years ago are starting to close in terms of monetization, whether it be dictated by screen sizes or people getting more comfortable. Or maybe some of the changes you will be making around mobile search with some of the ranking that we've seen in the Commonwealth tech this week. We\u2019d look to get some color about how you've seen mobile evolve and how you see it evolving going forward. Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Sure. Let me just give you some thoughts, and thank you for this. We are very excited about this pivotal mobile and it's really obviously a shift that started gradually and it's been very dramatic for us. So if you talked to every product manager at Google, and leader at Google, they have it at the forefront of their thoughts and how to delight the users, how to improve the experience, same thing on our advertising front. I think so one is obviously the efforts we're doing for the discovery, the search for information, be it in the apps or be it on mobile web. The other aspect of this that is really going to help us obviously with the monetization front, is the improvements in measurements. Measuring cross devices, measuring in-store sales.","And as you know, the end of shopping experience becomes more powerful because users can find this information, they can find it with local products. It doesn't become just about driving leaps to online retailers, it's about driving traffic to off-line stores via mobile. And we're seeing great adoption from retailers, from Macy's, REI Sears. So what should really \u2013 the way we're going to talk about this kind and you're going to hear us talk more about this is this intent and immediacy that we're so good at, given our heritage in search. And we are just applying all of that knowledge and all of that experience we have in ads and search to improving this mobile experience and how we monetize. Thank you.","Omid Kordestani","Thanks, Eric. Candace, our next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Eisner [ph] . Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. Can you hear me?","Patrick Pichette","We can. How are you Anthony.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. How are you, Patrick? Congratulations, and best wishes on your next endeavors. A couple of questions. First, I want to ask about Maps and Waves. I mean, it seems to me like those are very strategic assets and businesses where Google has a competitive advantage.","So can you just talk about the progress and user experiences with Maps and the opportunity going forward for the contribution to the business from those platforms? And then secondly, Patrick, given your telecom background, can you just please describe for us the strategy around Project Five that was announced this week? How does that connect back to the other Google Access initiatives like Google Fiber? And maybe just talk about the longer-term vision there. Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Great. Do you want to jump in first?","Omid Kordestani","Yes, sure. This is Omid. Thank you for the question. On Maps, we absolutely agree with you \u2013 very strategic, very popular, and that there are more than 1 billion active users of the Google Map services. We've mapped the world, as you know, 200 countries and territories, including North Korea. 1 billion times the app has been downloaded on android and lots and lots of stats to go through. I think one of the things we're doing is not only to improve that experience and integrate it as much as it make sense throughout the services, and whenever users can take advantage of the signals and the proper response from Google.","But the other side of this is also partnering. One of the things we're really actively doing is partnering on our Map service in native formats with as many partners out there that can take advantage of it. So it's a scenario we're really investing in, we are very excited about it and we have great traction, and we're also happy to offer it to our partners, and you will see us both in terms of Maps and Waves, you'll see it getting integrated in other popular web services out there.","Patrick Pichette","Great. On my side, look, there's quite a different rationale if you think of Fiber versus Access, which is really kind of asset-based. We've just, as a reminder to some of our \u2013 you may have heard \u2013 we just announced Fiber yesterday, so it's still very early days. It's focus on innovating and conductivity and communications but in \"partnership\" with carriers in the U.S., hardware makers. And we are trying to see again from users perspective and from a service perspective with or without assets what should look like the next wave of innovation.","So we've always, if you're always looking to make the web faster, cheaper, more available, and we wanted to try this new vision, this new idea of fast and easy wireless service, and then work with the ecosystem of our carriers, so that's why we have T-Mobile and Sprint as well as large carriers and manufacturers and developers to develop this kind of new product, new and innovative service. So, different in the sense that Anthony and in the case of Fiber or in the case of Loon it's really asset-based. This one is really about services and how can we use today's platforms to actually just drive for more innovation?","So that's really the difference, but we're pretty excited. It will be interesting to see the take rate and it will be interesting to see how the market response is to it. But again, very much as usual, kind of focused on innovation, focused on pushing the envelope. Thanks for your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Cool. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Stephen Ju","Patrick, bon voyage and best of luck with everything. So I'm trying to get some sense of the direction of costs involved in running YouTube? Granted, there's the revenue share component, the content owners, but then there's the everyday operating costs involved in just running the business like engineers, bandwidth, et cetera. So I'm wondering at this point what part of YouTube's cost base is variable and what part is fixed, because it seems like your revenue is now large enough to cover the costs to serve your users and the cost in the aggregate is probably not growing as rapidly as revenue.","And additionally, even as we adjust for the reclassification, I guess, of the double-click to network, the Eleanor line decelerated a bit more than we saw, so I'm just wondering if this just due to Play indexing higher against those countries, in spite of the highest amount of FX headwinds, or did you have some sort of hardware shortage issue this quarter also? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Okay. So let's start with the last one first, and then I'll come back to YouTube. On other revenues, what you have in there is, yes, you're right that we have the reclass, and then on the two other factors, clearly Play is going really well, but it is also hit by quite strong headwinds. So we are very pleased with the performance of Play, but given that it has not quite a large international SKU, it also kind of gets hit by headwinds of FX as well.","And then on the hardware side, no shortage this quarter so no shortage issues versus fixed so that's been performing quite well. But again, when you look at year-over-year comparisons for hardware, then last year, we had the new Nexus Seven tablet that was quite popular. Are you have quite a bit of noise on comparisons year-over-year. And that's really so you have the combination of these three things are flowing through the line. So that's why you end up with that kind of performance.","But what's most important is FX adjusted, we continue to be very, very pleased with the Play, the Play growth. On YouTube, I would interestingly, I mean, obviously, we don't divulge any of the details of what's fixed and was variable, and any of this. What I can tell you is we actually monitor the performance of YouTube for its profitability to make sure that it continues to grow profitably, and we basically kind of manage with Susan to reinvest at the right pace, if you will. So fueling the growth where it is showing up and keeping tight in areas where we need more efficiencies.","So that's where we managed again \u2013 I've said this in the past and I will say it again \u2013 if you just want to make YouTube profitable to more users, very easy, right? You put on the brakes on growth, and then it just turns into a profitable business. We continue to work with attention where Susan has the carrot of, hey, as much profitability as I can generate, I can reinvest at a certain base, so it creates a great incentive for this growth and disciplined behavior that we have there. So we are pretty pleased by it. Thank you so much for your question, Steven. Candace?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your line's open.","Ross Sandler","Great. I just had two quick follow-ups from the last question, and then one for Nikesh. So, Patrick, on the operating margin question, so given the increased discipline you talked about last call, do you think this flat margin is sustainable in 2015 and if not, what would cause it to drop back down year-on-year? And then from the prior question, so this new Other Revenue line was up like 23% in the quarter. I think it was like 19% or 20% last quarter. So surprising that the acceleration is in there given the FX trends. Can you just talk about is that Google Play or is that hardware between those two? And then for Nikesh, there has been some talk of Google introducing custom audience products for AdWords? Is that something you're willing to talk about and how big of a targeting future like that could be in terms of improving our lives and increasing spend and search?","Patrick Pichette","Okay. So, Ross, on my side, two points. One is on the issue of margin, you know we don't give guidance. So I can pronounce myself for the rest of 2015. But I think that in Q1, you see a good example of what we talked about when we had those comments in Q4, which is we drive for that right balance. That right balance of you want to fuel as much as possible responsibly, the growth of we have the areas where we want to invest, and in other areas, right, we may decide we're actually torque for efficiencies all the time.","And you see that in our Q1 results. In fact, I didn't mention it, but just a note on the head count. The vast majority of head count for Q1 is in fact engineers and project managers. It's not G&A. It's not sales. It's really focused on engineering, because that's what we wanted to put the emphasis. So I'm using this is an example of even though the numbers are large in a number of areas, there is actually a lot of science applied to every one of these numbers to make sure that we continue to drive for high efficiencies as much as we can.","You may have heard that in Q1, we canceled another program that we had, which was the Helpouts. So this program did not prove the promises that we had for it, and so we actually repurposed the team and shut down the entire initiative. So again, I'm just giving a signal that this is disciplined organization that looks at the facts that actually when it's not working, people can sense it, and then we have a good conversation about it, and then on the other side when we really see something kind of really going well, we want to make sure that we push hard for it.","In the case of the second piece that you've asked, which was the growth in Other Revenue, I think Play is doing very well. We are very happy about that. And yes, we're having good results on the Nexus Six, but year-over-year, it wasn't as strong as it would have given the strength of the Nexus Seven last year, so that's really been the big driver. And as for Nikesh, Nikesh I heard, is on his way to India right now. He was on a plane, but I have Omid here who would be delighted to answer your question.","Ross Sandler","Omid, I\u2019m sorry about that.","Omid Kordestani","That's all right. No problem.","Ross Sandler","We all do that.","Omid Kordestani","People confuse us and Nikesh is at Soft right now. So, let's see, on these rumors about custom audiences. You know we are very much focused on completing the cycle of better targeting and measurement attribution, at all points of the funnel with our different products. We are not announcing any new products at this point, but we have a great number of targeting options interest intent location across all the services from performance to brand. And I think you will see us innovate here, and continue to innovate here. So thank you.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, Ross . And I didn't mean to pick on you. We all tripped over on occasion all the time. Easiest...","Ross Sandler","Write down the cash on my notes. Sorry about that.","Patrick Pichette","No worries. Candace, let's go to our next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Peter Stabler","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Patrick, thanks for all the color around the click information. It begs another question now, and given the frequency with which a lot of us misinterpret these numbers, and given the growing importance of brand advertising and the accompanying expansion of attribution and ROI modeling to measure impact beyond simple clicks. Wondering if these metrics have outlived their usefulness and weather you guys are considering a way to help us understand your success behind brand advertising going forward? Thanks very much.","Patrick Pichette","Well, look, we look at this on a regular basis. I mean, we just happen to see on the YouTube side so much change in the last kind of couple of quarters that we thought it was worth mentioning. I think it's served as well, and if we ever decide to look at different ways to look at the business and want to report it that way, we will let you know. For now, we have really no difference in changes in the way that we reported. So that's the short answer, Peter.","Peter Stabler","Okay. Thank you.","Patrick Pichette","I think we have time for one last question. So why don't we take one last question before we close to call, Candace?","Operator","Thank you. And our last question come from the line of Mark May of Citi. Your line is now open.","Mark May","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. There's a few out there that consumer behavior is different on mobile versus desktop in terms of search and web usage versus apps. I'm wondering are you seeing that from your users as they shift from Desktop to mobile devices? I guess in that sense, is the growth in Mobile search activity offsetting the weakness that you may be seeing in desktop search? And then second question is just on verticals, by advertiser verticals. We had heard some data points during the quarter around potentially some weakness in the e-commerce category. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on maybe some verticals where you saw a particular strength and weakness? Thanks.","Patrick Pichette","Sure. Thank you, Mark, for the question. So let me just take the vertical one first in terms of performance. We definitely saw automotive and travel were stronger verticals this quarter. India was a strong performer as far as the geo goes for us. And those are really some of the areas that I could highlight. And I think in terms of this behavior change, we are really, really focused on studying it every day. I mean, the shift is very, very dramatic and that we are laser focused on being as good and relevant and fast and monetize well. All the things that we did on the desktop and continue to do on a desktop to do that on mobile.","So I think all I can say on that is that your right, behaviors are different. There's an immediacy having this device always with you, using it as your assistant, using your voice to make commands and getting results, using the maps and being in a moment of purchase decision. And as we rely on this information source to help you, so all of those things are really, really powerful, and we are very excited about it. It's a journey that we're all on and looking forward to doing a better job and to monetizing well.","Omid Kordestani","So thank you, Mark, for your question. Before I close, let me just kind of 10 seconds. First, Ruth will join us in about a month. We're really excited to have her. I will be here to help her in transition, but you will hear a much better voice in Q2 on the earnings call. So we're really looking forward to having her as part of the team. It, obviously, has been a delight to work at Google for the last seven years. I have kind of obviously three thanks, three huge thanks for that. First one is to the Google community, as Omid mentioned. All of these Googlers kind of are simply extraordinary individuals and people. These men and women, I mean, they just continue to develop the stream of innovation that is really changing the world and making it a better place. So it's been a real joy to work with every one of them.","My colleagues, I mean around this table. The IR team, as well as the executive group that I've kind of spent many, many hours over the years, and they're mostly friends now so thank you for your friendship and all of your warmth over the last few years.","And finally, you. I mean, the financial community, our shareholders. I mean, you've been kind of supportive, you've been probing, you've had the insights, you've been really with us, I mean, for the last seven years through kind of thick and thin as we've seen a lot of stuff come and go, and really a strong supporter for this a bit crazy, unconventional company. So I just need to thank you as well for all the great times together. With that, yes, I am going to grab my backpack and take off for the world. So you may see me somewhere in the world, and if you do, just please do stop and say hi. It'll be a delight to see you.","So with that, I'll let Candace close the call. Thank you so much, and we'll see you or Ruth will see you in Q2. Cheers.","Operator","Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone."],"1343":["Alphabet Inc.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ellen West, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ellen West","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet\u2019s conference call on Google\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings. With us today are Ruth Porat and Sundar Pichai. As you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. Please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call. This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com.

A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release. The press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.google.com.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thanks, Ellen. We turned in a strong performance in the third quarter, notwithstanding continued meaningful currency headwinds. The key highlight this quarter was the substantial growth of our mobile search revenue complemented by ongoing strong contributions from YouTube and our programmatic business. I will first give you a summary of the quarter, followed by specific financial details and conclude with comments regarding our upcoming move to segment reporting. Sundar will then review the business and product highlights of the quarter, after which we will take your questions.","Beginning with the summary of our financial performance, total revenue was $18.7 billion up 13% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. As a result of the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we realized a negative currency impact on our revenues of $1.6 billion or $1.3 billion after the benefit of our hedging program. Holding currency constant to prior periods, our total revenue grew 21% year-over-year and 7% sequentially.","On a GAAP basis, operating profit was $4.7 billion and the operating margin was 25%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating profit was $6.1 billion and the operating margin was 33%. GAAP operating income was up 26% versus last year and GAAP net income from continuing operations was up 36% year-over-year.","As a reminder, the year-on-year increases reflect a non-cash impairment charge of $378 million in the third quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP operating income was up 15% year-over-year and non-GAAP net income was up 19% year-over-year. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $5.73; non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $7.35.","As detailed in the earnings slides on our IR website, stock-based compensation totaled $1.4 billion, up 14% year-over-year and up 27% sequentially. With respect to stock-based compensation, the increase reflects the fact that our annual equity refresh grants were made in the third quarter as well as headcount growth.","Headcount increased 16% versus last year and 5% versus 2Q 2015. Sequential growth reflects typical seasonality with new grad starting, the vast majority of whom are engineers and product managers. Let me now turn to key elements of our financial statements, starting with our primary revenue sources.","Google sites revenue was $13.1 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, notwithstanding currency headwinds. Year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth reflect substantial strength in mobile search due to ongoing improvement in ad formats and delivery to better address how consumers use their mobile devices.","YouTube revenue continues to grow at a significant rate with growth driven primarily by video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred. Network revenue was $3.7 billion, up 4% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, continuing to reflect the significant growth of Programmatic, offset by the traditional network businesses. Other revenue was $1.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially.","Given the geographic mix of our Play business, FX also had an impact on other revenue. Year-over-year growth was driven by Google for Work, including cloud, as well as continued strong growth in Play. Both were offset by the absence of revenues included in 3Q 2014 from a licensing agreement and lower hardware sales, as we reached the end of life cycles for certain Chromecast and Nexus devices.","Next, let me discuss revenues by geography, which will highlight the impact currency headwinds continue to have on our non-U.S. business. U.S. revenue was up 19% year-over-year to $8.8 billion and up 9% versus Q2. UK revenue was up 10% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, and up 7% sequentially. In fixed FX terms, the UK grew 18% year-over-year, and 7% quarter-over-quarter. Rest of world revenue was up 7% versus last year to $8.1 billion and up 2% versus Q2. In fixed FX terms revenues were up 23% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. The acceleration in U.S. and UK growth in particular reflect the growth in mobile search.","Finally, on monetization, as a reminder, these metrics similarly are affected by currency movements. Aggregate paid clicks grew 23% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Aggregate CPCs were down 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. In terms of the drivers, within Google Sites paid clicks were up 35% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Google site CPCs were down 16% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially.","The movement in Google Sites paid clicks and CPCs primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube TrueView. Network paid clicks were down 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially reflecting the impact of our ongoing policy changes designed to reduce lower quality inventory on AdSense for Search, consistent with our focus on improving the user experience. Network CPCs were down 4% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially.","Let me now turn to expenses. Total traffic acquisition costs were $3.6 billion or 21% of total advertising revenue, essentially flat as a percentage of revenue sequentially and down slightly year-over-year. As a reminder, the Sites\u2019 tagline includes the tag that we paid the search distribution partners for distributing Google Search as distinct from their own branded search. Non-GAAP other cost of revenues was $3.2 billion in Q3, up 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by costs associated with operating our data centers, including depreciation, as well as content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and Play.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.7 billion or 31% of revenue, up 14% year-over-year and up 7% versus Q2. The increase in operating expense versus comparable periods was primarily driven by R&D expense. A breakout of individual operating expense lines is available on our earnings slides. Other income and expense was $183 million. The effective tax rate was 19% for the third quarter.","Turning now to CapEx and operating cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $2.4 billion, reflecting investments in production equipment, data center construction and facilities. Operating cash flow was $6 billion with free cash flow of $3.6 billion.","Finally turning to cash, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $73 billion, of which approximately $42 billion or 58% is held overseas. As we announced today, our board has authorized us to commence a repurchase of our Class C capital stock of up to $5,099,019,513.59. This decision is consistent with our overall capital management framework and complements a disciplined capital allocation program. Our primary uses of capital will of course remain CapEx and M&A across the breadth of our businesses.","So now let me conclude, starting in the fourth quarter with our move to segment reporting, we intent to provide additional detail for Google on the one hand, and all the other Alphabet businesses on the other hand. We refer to those other Alphabet businesses as Other Bets. We expect Other Bets to include among others Access and Energy, Nest, Life Sciences, our investment arms and X, which is where driverless cars and certain other incubation efforts reside.","Specifically, we intend to disclose for both Google and Other Bets revenues profitability and CapEx. By doing this we expect that you will be better able to understand how we manage the businesses, including the pace and allocation of our investments. As Larry said in his CEO letter announcing Alphabet, we are focused on rigorously managing capital allocation and working denature each business is executing well.","With that preface, let me turn to for key themes. First, in terms of revenues are strong revenue growth in Q3 reflects the ongoing momentum in Google with acceleration in mobile search complemented by the strength of YouTube and programmatic. The Other Bets our earlier stage businesses, which we believe have significant longer-term revenue potential. In the near-term, the focus there is on optimizing our investments. Second, with respect to profitability, we remain focused on managing expenses within our control, while investing to support the growth areas we have in Google and Other Bets. Segment reporting by definition provides greater insight into the profit dynamics within alphabet.","Third as to CapEx, the vast majority to date, of course has been to support Google, where we continue to invest given our exciting opportunities globally. At the same time CapEx and Other Bets is expected to increase through next year as we continue to execute on the growth agenda there. In particular in Access and Energy, which contains our fiber business, among other efforts. Fourth, our growing cash balance remains a powerful tool giving us the flexibility to invest in the breadth of opportunities we have within Google and Other Bets as well as to selectively pursue compelling new bets.","I will now turn the call over to Sundar, will go into more detail regarding our business trends and products.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Ruth. I\u2019m glad to be here with you all today to talk about the areas we are focused on now and in the future at Google. There is a real sense of energy and focus throughout the company and we\u2019re seeing momentum across our businesses. Products like Search, Android, Maps, Chrome and YouTube each have over a billion users already, and Google Play crossed that milestone this quarter as well. But what\u2019s most exciting is that we are just beginning to scratch the surface.","We know that computing transforms people\u2019s lives, we\u2019ve gone from the PC revolution to the Internet revolution to the mobile revolution. And 10 years from now, everything will be different again in ways no one can predict. Our vision is for Google to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses a unique technical expertise to tackle big problems and create that future. We do this, arm-in-arm with our partners around the world.","Today, I want to touch on three key areas that are important for us; first, making information accessible and useful; then how we are building computing platforms used by billions of people; and lastly, how we are driving growth in our core advertising business as well as new emerging businesses.","Let\u2019s start with the first area. Google\u2019s core mission has always been to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Search continues to be at the center of this with people turning to search on mobile every day to find quick answers, in fact search traffic on mobile phones have now surpassed desktop traffic worldwide.","We are also seeing strong mobile momentum in many emerging markets like India, which is a number two country for mobile search queries behind the U.S. This is the result of a laser focus on helping users quickly find the right information. People just want to be able to find the information they are looking for on mobile without having to worry about whether it lives on the mobile web or within apps. Mobile app usage as well as web usage is accelerating significantly.","We have now indexed more than hundred billion deep links within third-party apps. So if you\u2019re looking for information that lives within an app will surface it as a result, and even give you an install link if you don\u2019t already have it. The teams have made great progress and 40% of search is now returned app index results in the top five results. These investments have gone well and you\u2019ll continue to see us push in this area.","We also continue to improve the Google app, for instance app developers can now build conversational voice experiences that work within the Google app, so if you ask Google to play NPR, NPR will respond by asking if you want to pick up where you left off, or catch up on the latest news. It\u2019s also very important that we help to make the mobile web better and faster for users, both through our own products and by partnering with others. Working with over 30 publication and technology partners we recently announced an open source initiative called Accelerated Mobile Pages to make it easy for publishers and content creators to build superfast webpages for their content. This will help make the mobile web a better more enjoyable experience for users.","I also want to point out that our investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence are a priority for us. Machine learning has long powered things like voice search, translation, and much more. And our machine learning is hard at work in mobile services like Now on Tap, which quickly assist you by providing additional useful information for whatever you\u2019re doing, right in the moment, anywhere on your phone. If you\u2019re an Android user that runs Marshmallow, try it out by long pressing the home button, when you\u2019re in the Map, it\u2019s very cool.","Another example is the Google photos app, which leverages powerful machine learning technology to help people discover, organize and share their photos. It\u2019s a great product that people love. In fact, in just a few months since we launched it at Google I\/O, photos is now used by over a 100 million users who have collectively uploaded more than 50 billion photos and videos.","Now I want to talk about how we\u2019re building computing platforms that are used by billions of people. We\u2019ll continue to invest in large open ecosystems that we\u2019ve build with partners to reach great scale. Android is a prime example of this, and we\u2019re seeing exciting momentum on our platform. There are more than 1.4 billion 30-day active Android users around the world, and we are beginning to roll out Android Marshmallow which is our best-performing release yet.","Working with partners Huawei and LG, we announce the newest devices joining our Nexus family. The Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X. They are beautiful and powerful devices that show off the latest and greatest that the android has to offer and they\u2019ve got tremendous reviews so far. We also announced the Pixel C which is the first android tablet built N2N by Google that brings together the benefits of a full-size keyboard with the portability of tablet. We\u2019re also creating platforms for newer areas of computing such as android wear, which now works with iOS as well.","Android Auto, the Internet of Things platform that we unveiled at I\/O Brillo, and of course Chrome. Chrome also powers Chromecast, and our recent Chromecast update gave it a refreshed look and faster performance. We also introduced Chromecast audio, which lets you stream your favorite music from your phone to any set of speakers. To date we have sold over 20 million Chromecast devices and have seen over 1.5 billion taps of the cast button since we launched.","We\u2019re also seeing great momentum in our ads business. Our value proposition to market is of all sizes is simple, Google can help you show the right ads to the right people, at the right moment. As you\u2019ve heard on these calls before, we are seeing a major shift in consumer behavior to its micro-moments. These are moments of high intent when consumers are looking to find, buy or do something. They happen throughout the day most often on mobile devices. The single biggest theme throughout our advertising business is to help small businesses, large marketers, agencies and content creators to take advantage of this mobile opportunity.","In search advertising is a huge amount going on. Advertisers like Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Airbnb are turning to mobile search to capitalize on these key moments reach customers, and create engaging local experiences. We also recently made search ads in Google Play available to all developers letting app developers find new customers for their app at a great price where it matters.","Many smart developers are already taking advantage of this. At Adweek, we introduced Customer Match, which lets marketers reach their existing customers with customized search ads on Google.com, as well as ads in YouTube and Gmail. Of course, these are really valuable for reaching key customers at moments of high intent on mobile devices.","With the holiday season coming up, we are investing in providing great shopping experiences on mobile. We are also helping marketers understand how Search ads are driving in-store sales with products like Store Visits which uses our unique mobile location capabilities and is easy for any business to implement.","Moving to YouTube, everyday people watch hundreds-of-millions of hours on YouTube. You know from the last quarterly call about the amazing momentum that YouTube has in mobile. It\u2019s largely coming from the YouTube app. The growth in mobile watch time also extends to videos featuring product reviews and information. People turn to YouTube and they want to research, buy or fix a product. For example, mobile watch time for apparel videos has doubled this year and videos about toys have also doubled.","We see the same growth in advertising on the platform too. And we continue to invest in building ways for marketers to reach consumers effectively, like our recently announced shopping ads for YouTube, which lets people shop directly from a video, turning any relevant video into your digital storefront. And in programmatic video and display, the strong momentum continues. The number of advertisers using our programmatic solutions has nearly doubled in the last year-and-a-half, and now includes over 80% of adages top hundred advertisers.","Additionally, both mobile and video impressions served on DoubleClick Bid Manager have grown more than 3.5X since last year. This is an area that\u2019s on fire for us right now and you\u2019ll see us to continue to invest in creating the best programmatic solutions for advertisers and agencies. Before I close, I want to touch on a few of our emerging businesses where we see enormous opportunities.","First, digital content, Google Play continues to be a thriving hub for our digital content business, now with over 1 billion users. And just yesterday, I was really pleased that we announced YouTube Red, our YouTube subscription service for just $9.99 a month. It enables you to see videos on YouTube without ads, watch them offline, or keep playing videos when you lock your screen or start using another application.","Additionally, our Google for Work business is seeing tremendous growth. In the third quarter, we crossed 1 million paying active customers using Google Drive at Work. Cloud is also a growing area where we see great opportunity and we are building a fantastic service that we\u2019ll keep investing in. Our momentum in the education space continues as well with more than 50 million Google apps for education users worldwide, and over 10 million teachers and students using Google Classroom since it launched a year ago. There are also 30,000 new Chromebooks activated in schools in the U.S. every school day. That\u2019s more than all other devices combined.","So to wrap up, we have tremendous new opportunities in our new and existing businesses. We are really excited by the products and platforms that we are building for people everywhere in the world. And we are passionate about the transformative power of computing to improve people\u2019s lives in the years ahead.","Thank you to everyone for your keen interest in our business. And thank you to all of the Googlers around the world for another great quarter. And with that, I will hand it back to Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you, Sundar. And we will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Mark Mahaney","Great. Thanks. Two questions, could you talk about the sustainability of the mobile search revenue growth that you see there? And is that just really been driven by finally the gapping up of kind of mobile search pricing versus desktop pricing or is there something else going on?","And then, Ruth, I was just trying to figure out how you came up with that - your repurchase number and I\u2019ve been Googling that number a couple of times. I can see it\u2019s 26 to the E18 of the square root of that, but outside of that, how did you come up with that particular amount of share buyback? Why not more and why not less? Thanks.","Ruth Porat","Thanks, Mark. So starting on the sustainability of mobile revenue growth, as I said, in my opening comments, revenue growth really reflects continued improvement in ad formats and delivery. And that\u2019s on top of what\u2019s a really strong industry-wide global growth in mobile usage as you know well. And then we regularly adjust the way we present ads. So we expanded ad space in some queries with particularly high commercial intent to display more relevant mobile friendly ads.","And our view is just as we saw consumer behavior change on desktop we are seeing the same on mobile. And as Sundar said, we continue to believe we\u2019re in very early innings here. And then in terms of sizing, so this is the way we approached it. If I take you back to the capital framework that I laid out last quarter, it\u2019s defined primarily by CapEx and M&A, but also includes working capital and a buffer as well as a potential return of capital.","And we remain focused on solving the biggest problems and solving them at scale and that presents sizable potential revenue opportunities. It was a key catalyst for creating Alphabet. But these opportunities also require investment. And so the focus of our team is on prioritizing these opportunities over a multiyear period. We look out, kind of as we\u2019re modeling it out a number of years. And then working with the Board we reviewed our outlook. We reviewed the opportunity set and we concluded that layering in this action at this time complements what we view as a very disciplined budgeting process, while still very importantly providing ample capacity to pursue the growth agenda.","And then, applying this framework once we had come up with the size that we believe fits and consistent with the way we do things around here, we decided to come up with some fun math similar to the way we approach sizing the IPO, which sounds like you\u2019ve fit back right into what that was. We do view it as the right action at the right time. And it really is anchored in the framework.","Mark Mahaney","Thanks, Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ross Sandler","Thanks. I have one for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, so back to the mobile search question, the bear-case on Google has been the company\u2019s ability or lack thereof to port the search business model from PC over to mobile. And you called out mobile search is the key driver of acceleration in both the U.S. and UK. So can you just give us a little bit of more color around the volume trends that you are seeing between desktop and mobile as you cross that 50% threshold that you talked about last quarter.","And then, Sundar, on the platform side, it seems like every few years new company crop up as the next big Android OEM. Looks like it\u2019s Huawei now. It\u2019s been other companies in the past. How do you plan on getting Android to a point where all these OEMs can build successful businesses on the back of it? And any update on when Google plans to roll out the Play Store in China would be helpful. Thank you.","Ruth Porat","So starting with mobile and our outlook there, clearly, as I said, mobile search revenue was up significantly and it was an important catalyst in the quarter. But the very important thing to note, as we discussed also last quarter, is that desktop remains a solid contributor. And so we continue to have a healthy growth there. And when we look, if you step back, overall sites revenue, we\u2019re firing on all cylinders, really strong growth in mobile, desktop is healthy and continuing to grow. And then you layer on top of it YouTube and some of the color that Sundar added there. But that\u2019s really a continuation of what we talked about last quarter as well.","Sundar Pichai","And on the platform side, look, we continue to see tremendous momentum overall on Android. In just over a year, we\u2019ve gone from 1 billion to 1.4 billion users. So obviously that translates into huge opportunities for OEMs and that\u2019s what we are seeing. Especially, there are whole new markets opening up, there\u2019s next billion users coming online in emerging markets. And businesses, I mean, Enterprises, a whole opportunity for OEMs as well. So I think there is a lot of room ahead.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Carlos Kirjner","Thank you. I have two questions as well, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, in two parts, if you take a three-year view what are the three main milestones you think you need to reach to be successful as Google\u2019s CEO? And what you think would be the externally observable consequences of achieving these milestones?","And Ruth, in the last call, you talked about the 70\/20\/10 framework. Can you help us understand what 70\/20\/10 applies to? Is it related to operating expenses, or expenses in cost in the P&L, CapEx, R&D, management time? And is it an explicit constraint in the budgeting process or am I trying to read too much into something that\u2019s just a concept of framework and a broad guideline? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Carlos. In terms of how I think about it, I think we are fortunate to have an incredibly broad mission statement. Organizing the world\u2019s information turns out to be something that has a lot of room ahead, we are still in the early days. Especially with mobile I think you have a computing platform that\u2019s going to reach, it\u2019s already reached half the world\u2019s population or on its way to reach the entirety of the human population in about five to 10 years.","So want to stay focused on that both from information standpoint and a computing standpoint, I think of them as two sides of the same coin, and making sure we are building the right user experience for that. And so that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on.","Ruth Porat","And then on 70\/20\/10 it\u2019s intended to be instructive and it\u2019s intended to mirror the founders\u2019 vision and really capture how we devote our resources, which for us means, how do we apply effort. And for me, one of the many very important statements from the founders that explains this framework is when they said in the letters some years ago and repeated since, incrementalism in technology leads to irrelevance and thus innovation is critical.","And so this mantra is really about pushing people to look at new areas, invest in newer areas, look for things that are adjacent the 20% and even the unrelated big bets, the 10%. It\u2019s not intended to be a specific guide to financial modeling. I think with our move to segment reporting, we look forward to giving you more information next quarter which should be helpful there, but directionally to talk about philosophically how do we think about our approach to the business.","Carlos Kirjner","Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you very much. This question is for Ruth. I was just wondering given you\u2019re likely in the midst of 2016 business planning right now. Can you share with us the way in which you\u2019re approaching budgeting versus maybe how it was done last year? And are there any specifics you can share with us in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about it? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Well. I guess a couple of things, there has been a very strong foundation here on budgeting and the approach and setting an envelope, and working very closely with business leaders on what that that envelope should be, and we are in the midst of it in. As I said last quarter, but to emphasize our priority remains revenue growth and that doesn\u2019t give us a pass on a rigorous approach to expense growth, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused.","So I think really what was very encouraging for me is there is a framework, a very strong approach to financial planning and analysis, and really building on that to make sure we have reasonable but tight envelope so that we can have the right conversations collectively, collaboratively with our business leaders to assess how we can look at optimizing all of our resources, and that\u2019s what it really comes down to, it\u2019s looking at how to manage the rate of growth of expenses, while still supporting our growth initiatives and we\u2019ll be going into more of that in as we go through our segment reporting in the fourth quarter.","Heather Bellini","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Brian Nowak","Thanks for taking my questions. One on YouTube, I guess could you talk some of the qualitative drivers that are really bring more advertising dollars on the YouTube. And then, I think last quarter you\u2019d mentioned top 100 advertisers spend was up 60% year-on-year on YouTube. I\u2019m wondering if you could update us on that?","And the second one, on Search, sounds like mobile is accelerating, where you now in the mobile versus desktop monetization gap. And Sundar, how do you think about that long-term, you see mobile being higher, reaching equilibrium, how do you see that trending?","Sundar Pichai","On the YouTube one, look I mean to shift to video is a profound medium shift, and especially in the context of mobile. And obviously users are following that you\u2019re seeing it in YouTube as well as elsewhere in mobile. And so advertisers are being increasingly conscious, they\u2019re being very, very responsive. And so we are seeing great traction there, and we\u2019ll continue to see that, they are moving more of their traditional budgets to YouTube and that\u2019s where we\u2019re getting traction.","On mobile search - to me - increasingly we see - we already announced that or 50% of our searchers are on mobile. Mobile gives us very unique opportunities in terms of better understanding users and over time as we use things like machine learning, I think we can make great strides. So my long-term view on this is, it is ask compelling or in fact even better than the desktop, but it will take us time to get there, and we\u2019re going to be focused to be get that.","Brian Nowak","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the question, maybe a big picture question with respect to media distribution, media consumption and monetizing that you should across all the platforms that you distribute media. I\u2019m so curious about the various business models you\u2019re now putting in front of consumers, subscription versus advertising versus paper unit like on Google Play. How you think about the about the pros and cons and some of those distribution models? And do how think about the need to may be source content yourself for media distribution? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks. To me, we want to stay focused on the user experience and we want to follow what users want, right. So if you take something like YouTube, we expect most users to consume, YouTube debate has been and advertising has been a strong part of providing the content for free to those users, and it\u2019s growing very, very well, but we also see a need for certain users, in certain scenarios be it music or gaming or for premium content to experience it in a different way. And we want to make sure we do that. So we don\u2019t have a prescriptive opinion on this as much as we will provide the right user experience and follow where it goes, and that applies to Google Play as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Justin Post","Thank you. Two things, Ruth, it really does seem like there\u2019s been a change in the management philosophy this year as far as kind of expense discipline into 2Q, also have seen the disclosures and now you get the buyback announcement. Could you talk about the change there, if there has been one, and how you think about that?","And then the second thing, we were pretty focus on the cloud over here, Google. We don\u2019t have a number. It\u2019s in your other revenues, but Amazon is probably $8 billion plus run rate, Microsoft over $1.5 billion. Just wondering you can give us any thoughts on your cloud strategy and how you\u2019re thinking about using those really strong data center assets? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","So I guess, there were a couple of things, on expenses and expense management and clearly a lot of the foundation here has - was laid some time ago. I think after a period of big expense buildup, there was an appreciation that we needed to manage the cadence of spend. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and collectively we\u2019re locked arm-in-arm to make sure that there\u2019s resource prioritization. I think that\u2019s an important part of that we have an extraordinary set of opportunities, not just within Google but across the Alphabet businesses, and we need to ensure that prioritization is a key part of all that that we do.","I would note that when you\u2019re looking at some of the expenses, operating expenses is an example. When we look forward to the fourth quarter, in particular given the hardware launches that we\u2019ve done here with the Nexus Chromecast and Pixel launches, a consistent with prior device launches we would expect higher sales and marketing and I realized I\u2019m getting a little more specific than your question, but I think it\u2019s very important to note that there are also certain patterns to some of these similarly with CapEx, CapEx is - it\u2019s been a bit more muted here. And I indicated last quarter that where in a bit of a digestion period.","But when you look forward to 2016, we do see accelerated investment given the nature of the businesses that we\u2019re building up here. So I want to also just keep make sure, we can things and perspective. And I think, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s been an extraordinary experience joining this team, I think the with the move to Alphabet it gives us the opportunity to then provide some greater insight into the extraordinary operating performance within Google and breakouts you can see the investments that we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re working very tightly as a senior team here as we make that next step into this new environment in Alphabet.","Sundar Pichai","On the cloud side, and he observed, I mean it\u2019s an exceptional opportunity, I think it just reflects is a secular shift every businesses in the world is going to run on cloud, eventually and so we viewed as an amazing opportunity. We\u2019re uniquely qualified to do so, as he pointed out we have tremendous experiences and running large scale cloud services.","And it\u2019s been only in the past two years, and earnest we have been taking those assets and serving customers outside. For me, what\u2019s exciting as I look at new customer adoption, we are seeing tremendous momentum. We\u2019re very competitive in each of those situations, and we are investing a lot and playing for the long-term.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Douglas Anmuth","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Sundar, I want to ask about mobile. You talked about being greater than 50% of queries and want to ask if you have a view on whether - on when that will pass 50% of clicks. And then also your thoughts on what happens to desktop pricing in demand, as that happens how do you think about the tail on the desktop business as mobile just continues to take share? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai","The interesting thing, we\u2019re seeing is, when we talk about mobile, mobile is a computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of his desktop today as well. So overall it\u2019s a shift in a computing paradigm, it\u2019s not just form factors. And so overtime we see all of this is together. What matters to us as people evolve they are computing paradigm search transitions to that world, and we are the best source to provide that information.","So along that line, I expect all the metrics to follow the trend, and so we only see, all the right indicators, and so I think we are position for the long-term well, so I can\u2019t comment too much on the specifics beyond that.","Douglas Anmuth","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Sena from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ken Sena","Thank you. I just have an ad format question, maybe just to follow-up on Eric\u2019s. We noticed that there was an additional ad slot added on mobile. And can you just maybe talk through the decisioning on that? And if so, is there anything we should interpret as far as the other ad formats that have been used too? Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Well, big picture what we are doing is looking at ways to use the mobile screen space to be as useful as possible for users. So this quarter we had some important changes and we\u2019re always focused on innovation, and we\u2019re growing in a growing market. But as we\u2019ve said we\u2019re looking at how consumer behavior is changing and just as it did on desktop we\u2019re seeing the same on mobile and the notion of trying to make sure were being as useful as possible for users is key driver and we\u2019ll continue to innovate.","Ken Sena","And maybe just this one follow-up. Can you see anything then it maybe in terms of the success with the efficiency that you\u2019re seeing in terms of text based mobile ads versus more of the other structured data ones that\u2019s around like part of glycerin [ph] or hotel price ads and so forth? Thanks.","Ruth Porat","Yes. There is probably not much to add there.","Ken Sena","Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Nomura. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente","Thanks a lot. I have two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar is ad blocking something that potential have an impact on the business either in the fourth quarter or longer term? And then, Ruth, in terms of M&A just wondering if the buyback might indicate that the company is becoming a bit more selective around larger acquisitions than it\u2019s been in prior periods of the company\u2019s lifecycle? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Anthony. On the ad blocker stuff, it\u2019s not a new phenomenon. I think it\u2019s important to understand that ads today fun almost all the services which people use, including products like Google Search, Google Maps many, many third-party products. For publishers, it represents the majority of the revenue and I think users are okay with the contract and we need to make sure it works well. It\u2019s also clear that that are areas where the ad experience is getting in the way, it affects performance, and so we as industry need to collectively do all that better. And so we are going to work hard to do that.","And then, so we want to make sure we transition areas like the mobile web to have better ad experiences. But overall, I think we\u2019ve used to this, we\u2019ve seen this for a while overwhelmingly the model works well and we expect that to continue.","Ruth Porat","And then, in terms of your M&A question, I talked about how did we think of sizing the return, I started with what\u2019s really most quarter as which is continuing to focus on the biggest problems and solving them at scale, and ensuring that we\u2019re investing in those. And as I said that\u2019s primarily to find by obviously the opportunity, but how do we support the growth that\u2019s about capital expenditure and about M&A, and those are really the anchor pillars in our capital framework. And then beyond that there is working capital and a buffer and then the potential return of capital. We talked about the fact that we have six products that have over billion users. Three of those were through acquisitions, YouTube, Android and Maps that is not lost on us, and then you layer on top of that, double-click that was also through acquisition.","So we do have you viewed app and at the time, it wasn\u2019t clear, I\u2019d say everybody that those would end up being the incredibly powerful businesses, effective businesses for users that they are today. And so it remains a part of what we consider the bar is high, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t want you to read anything into it beyond, what it is it fits right within our framework, and as I said, we reviewed is the right action at the right time.","Anthony DiClemente","That\u2019s it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Vogel from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Paul Vogel","Great. Thanks. Two questions, please. First, just when we think about search and deep liking. Can you just sort of quantify a little bit how important deep linking has been to either click, so ROI or improvements in CPC on mobile? And then, the second question is just as we think about the more transparency going forward in Q4. How should we think about businesses that currently are in the Other Bets line that may continue to growing. What would be considered to move something from other bets into core Google? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","On the deep linking, I would view it as, we\u2019re beginning to scratch the surface in terms of how we get it information within apps. What\u2019s been exciting to us is all of the indication show that when we provide these deep links. Users respond to them the same way they\u2019ve done with links to websites and the model is working well. And second think maybe\u2026","Ruth Porat","Yes. Interesting in the way frame the question, so within other bets we have a pretty broad array of challenges, opportunities that are being tackled, as you know well from life sciences to driverless cars to what we\u2019re doing in access and energy. And those we\u2019re funding, we\u2019ve got a very rigorous disciplined approach to looking at the metrics against which they\u2019re performing and growing. But you used a term, when do they move into Google. And I wouldn\u2019t assume that, that\u2019s the plan. What we\u2019re really looking at is how do we continue to broaden the nature of issues that we\u2019re able to address.","What we want with Alphabet is to be an extraordinary magnet, the best magnet for entrepreneurs, and to be an accelerant for their development. And to give them that the kind of environment where we can continue to thrive, and therefore build great businesses that generate tremendous returns as well for our stakeholders on top of solving big problems. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean, in fact, we\u2019re very much thinking they will continue to grow and be independent entity. So it is a broader view of what is Alphabet.","Paul Vogel","Got it. So just to be clear, it\u2019s not about that there are sort of newer or smaller or growing. It\u2019s just they\u2019re separate business that will grow on their own, separate from the core Google.","Ruth Porat","Our view is that we are seeding them and they are growing. And we\u2019re not pre-determining what ends up happening. There are big opportunities and we\u2019re excited to be in a position where we can address them in a way that is an incredible magnet for great entrepreneurs.","Paul Vogel","Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Stephen Ju","Okay. Thanks. Sundar, so I think it was on a conference call about three years ago when Larry articulated a vision of a simple and consistent consumer experience from Google, and the same for your advertising customers as well. So as this is your first conference call with investors where do you think you are in that initiative today? Are you still on the same path or do you plan to take that on a different direction in your new role?","And Ruth, despite the high growth of YouTube and Play presumably, are your cost of goods sold where the content cost of these two businesses live is not growing as rapidly. So will you give some color on where you might be driving the opage [ph]? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai","On the first one, I think the vision that Larry articulated, it\u2019s a very compelling vision and it\u2019s still valid. To me, the way I think about it is mobile is a good forcing function in some ways. It\u2019s a good constraint for us to focus and deliver against that vision. So what I\u2019m doing is internally all our objectives are primarily focused on mobile, and how within the context of mobile we get to a better, simpler and a consistent experience for consumers and advertisers. And so, that framework is how we are thinking about it and I think we are making solid progress.","Ruth Porat","And then, if you\u2019re focusing on the other cost to revenue line, the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth was driven by ongoing data center operations, including depreciation that\u2019s in there as well, as well as content acquisition costs, as you said primarily YouTube and Play. One thing to note as we look forward to the fourth quarter with the launch of Nexus, Chromecast and Pixel, it\u2019s worth noting that we do book the hardware costs in this line.","Stephen Ju","Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Mark May","Thanks. I had two questions that are kind of interrelated around mobile apps. When you talk about the strength in mobile search are you including also searches that are done on some of your mobile apps like search done on the Maps app or on the mobile YouTube app? And then, kind of somewhat related I guess is, yes, I think it is six apps that have over 1 billion users globally. But some of these you\u2019re not really monetizing today or very nascent stages. Can you talk about kind of your efforts maybe to monetize some of these large and actively used apps and maybe identify one or two where you\u2019re, I guess, it\u2019s for Sundar, where you\u2019re particularly sort of excited about the opportunities? Thanks.","Sundar Pichai","Thanks, Mark. On the first one, or maybe you\u2019re specifically talking about the mobile search experience on Google.com or the Google app, but we are seeing the same traction within Maps or YouTube. We are seeing mobile usage dramatically grow and in that context people are searching as well. So it\u2019s across-the-board we are seeing strength. In terms of our app such of scale, and obviously we take a very long-term view. And several of those apps today already play huge roles, so for example, take Google Maps, it already plays a huge important role in making mobile search better. And so these are interrelated.","YouTube is obviously a big opportunity. Google Play is one. And even things like Gmail are playing a critical role in Google for Work and how we are driving big business opportunities as well. And, by the way, because we are scaling all these apps over 1 billion users, we are building the infrastructure which is what will power our cloud platform externally as well. So in many ways these are all working for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Colin Sebastian form Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Colin Sebastian","Great. Thanks. I want to ask about two areas of business mentioned on the call. One is machine learning. And it\u2019s just coming up a lot more frequently as a topic and I wonder if you could mention more specifically the vision that you have for some of the core applications and how machine learning can make them more useful.","And then, just as a follow to the question on the Google Cloud, and specifically, the Infrastructure-as-a-Service layer, I wonder there if your strategy is more focused on price or if there are other ways that you can differentiate the service from the competition? Thank you.","Sundar Pichai","Machine learning is core transformative way by which we are rethinking everything we are doing. We\u2019ve been investing in this area for a while. We believe we are state-of-the-art here. And the progress particularly in the last two years has been pretty dramatic. And so we are - we are thoughtfully applying it across all our products, be it search, be it ads, be it YouTube and Play et cetera. And we are in early days, but you will see us in a systematic manner, think about how we can apply machine learning to all these areas.","On Cloud, I think the right way to think about it over time, for a company or for a developer to build stuff on cloud, they need not just basic things like computer and storage, they need a whole set of services on top of it. We - so there is a lot in the stack. And so I think the way we will differentiate over time is because we have built large services on top of our infrastructure, we understand all the layers which you need to build great application. So you would see us increasingly provide value-added services on top of compute and storage. And that\u2019s the way I think we\u2019ll play this.","Operator","Thank you. And that\u2019s all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Ellen West for any closing remarks.","Ellen West","Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Thank you and have a good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"1168":["Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 12, 2012  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Jane Penner","Larry Page - Co-Founder, Chief Executive officer, Director, Member of Acquisition Committee and Member of Executive Committee","David C.

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Jane Penner. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Jane Penner","Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. With us are Larry Page, Chief Executive Officer; David Drummond, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, and Chief Legal Officer; Patrick Pichette, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.","Also, as you know, we distribute our earnings release through our Investor Relations website located at investor.google.com. So please refer to our IR website for our earnings releases, as well as the supplementary slides that accompany the call.","This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website in a few hours.","Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward looking, including statements regarding Google's future investments, our long-term growth and innovation, the expected performance of our business and our expected level of capital expenditures.

Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Larry.","Larry Page","Thank you. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. It's great to be here with all of you. I'll talk about our new class of stock at the end of my remarks, but first, I want to focus on our performance. We had a very strong quarter with revenue up 24% year-on-year at $10.6 billion. Since becoming CEO again last April, I've pushed hard to increase our velocity, improve our execution and focus on the big bets that will make a difference in the world. Google is a large company now, but we'll achieve more and do it faster if we approach life with the passion and the soul of a startup. This has involved a lot of cleanups. We've given many of our products including Search a visual refresh. They now have a more consistent look and feel. When we've closed or combined over 30 products, we have so many opportunities that without hard choices we end up spreading ourselves too thin and don't have the impact that we strive for.","Creating a simpler and more intuitive user experience across Google has been another important focus. I have always believed that technologies should do the hard work, but just takes scheduling and communications, so users can get on with what makes them happiest, life. Our products work seamlessly together so people don't have to navigate Google to get stuff done.","Chrome for Android, which launched this quarter, is a great example of this kind of simplicity we're shooting for. It does mean switching between devices painless. All of your tabs are there across your desktop and Android, you can even click the back button on a different device and it just works. Just try it out, it's a great experience.","It's the same with Google Play, which we also shipped this quarter. You can now access all your movies, your books and apps and games from the web or from your Android device, no cables, downloading or syncing required. We spent years working with partners to get all of this great content. So it's really exciting to see it brought together in a beautifully simply way that people can enjoy.","Now Google+ is truly at the heart of our efforts to create a simpler, more intuitive experience for all of our users. You should think of it in 2 parts. One is just our social spine. Once you're logged in and have upgraded to Google+, you're just using one Google, not a series of disconnected products. It's still early days, but with over 120 Google integrations to date -- Google+ integrations to date, we're on the right track. And your user experience on Google just gets better. You can see friends' recommendations when you're using Google Play and you don't think about that as Google+, but it just comes from that infrastructure. And we're seeing a positive impact all across the web. Google users can now recommend search results they like, a goal we\u2019ve had ever since we started the company.","The other part is the social destination, which is accessed on your mobile client or on plus.google.com. This social destination part grew from a base of 0, not starting with all Google users like the part I was previously talking about, and is growing quickly. In fact, we see impressive engagement in fast growth here. It's just not all of Google. We are starting up a new community.","We're excited about the amazing speed with which some people have amassed over 1 million followers, and I have just been lucky enough to pass 2 million. I get high-quality feedback on the public post I make, which I really enjoy. And every day we make Google+ better. Just yesterday, we took another big step forward with a beautiful new UI for Google+. And the new customizable navigation driven in that redesign makes it much easier to access your favorite apps. There's better discoverability for Hangouts and you'll love the larger images that you see across that interface.","Now last time, there's a bit of confusion over the metrics I gave about Google+. I want to be clear about these 2 parts of Google+ and the fact that we have made great progress on both parts. As you would expect, the social spine is proportional to Google and all of the usage across Google. And Google\u2019s pretty big. And well over 170 million people have now upgraded to Google+.","So to summarize, there are 2 parts to the Google+ experience: the part that is the social spine, and the other part that's the social destination part of Google+ exclusively. Both of these are growing fast, but the social destination part of Google+ is growing as a new product with very healthy growth.","I'm also excited by our big bets. We have some amazing new products that were seen as crazy when we launched them, but now have phenomenal usage. They can easily pass the toothbrush test. They're important enough that millions of people use them at least once or twice a day. Chrome has over 200 million users. Our Display business has reached an annualized run rate of over $5 billion and 850,000 Android devices are activated every day. And YouTube just keeps on growing. These are just staggering even by Google standard. They had over 800 million monthly users uploading over an hour of video per second. I'm incredibly proud of these achievements. They wouldn't have been possible without an amazing team of Googlers and the long-term focus with which we are able to run the company, which brings me to this afternoon's announcement about our stock.","Now throughout our evolution from being privately held startup to a large publicly listed company, we have managed Google for the long term and enjoying tremendous success as a result, especially since our IPO in 2004. The founders, Sergey and I, really hoped but we did not expect that Google would have such significant impact. And that this progress has made us even more impatient to do important things that matter in the world. Our enduring love for Google comes from a strong desire to create technology products that enrich millions of people's lives in deep and meaningful ways. To fulfill these dreams, we need to ensure that Google remains a successful growing business that can generate significant returns for everyone involved.","When we went public in 2004, we established some clear well-publicized expectations for investors around our governance. We wrote a couple of things in our original founder\u2019s letter, I just want to read here. \"New investors will fully share in Google's long-term economic future, but will have little ability to influence its strategic decisions through their voting rights. And we are creating a new corporate structure that is designed for stability over the long-time horizons. By investing in Google, you're placing an unusual long-term bet on a team, especially Sergey and me.\"","I wanted to quote all that because these are the clear well-publicized expectations we established for investors. And while this decision was controversial at the time, we believe with hindsight it was absolutely the right thing to do. Eight years later, these still -- statements are still remarkably accurate and everyone involved has realized tremendous benefits.","Given Google's success, it's unsurprising this type of dual-class governance structure is now somewhat standard among newer technology companies. In our experience, success is more likely if you concentrate on the long term. Technology products often require significant investment over many years to fulfill their potential. For example, it took 3 years just to ship our first Android handset and then another 3 years on top of that before the operating system truly reach critical mass. These kind of investments are not for the fainthearted.","Long-term product investments like Chrome and YouTube, which now enjoy phenomenal usage, were made with a significant degree of independence. However, day-to-day dilution from routine equity-based employee compensation and other possible dilutions, such as stock-based acquisitions, will likely undermine this dual-class structure and our aspirations for Google over the very long term. We have put our hearts into Google and hope to do so for many years to come, so we want to ensure that our corporate structure can sustain these efforts and our desire to improve the world.","Today, we announced plans to create a new class of nonvoting capital stock. These shares will be distributed via stock dividend to all existing stockholders. The owner of each existing share will receive one new share of the nonvoting stock, giving investors twice the number of shares they had before. Effectively, a 2-for-1 stock split, something many of our investors have long asked us for. These nonvoting shares will be available for corporate uses like equity-based employee compensation that might otherwise dilute our governance structure.","In November 2009, Sergey and I published plans to sell a modest percentage of our overall stock ending in 2015. We are currently halfway through those plans and we don't expect any changes to that, certainly not as the result of this new potential class. We both remain very much committed to Google for the long term. It's important to bear in mind that this proposal will only have an effect on governance over the very long term. In fact, there's no particular urgency to make these changes now. We don't have an unusually big acquisition planned, in case you are wondering.","Investors and others have always taken a big bet on Sergey and me, and that bet will likely last longer as a result of these changes. We are honored that so many of you have put your trust in us and recognize the tremendous responsibility that rests on our shoulders. We think this is a good thing because users rely on Google to produce and operate amazing technology products and to safely and responsibly store their data. That is our passion.","Thank you very much, and I will now hand over to David to explain some of the more technical aspects of this proposal.","David C. Drummond","Thanks, Larry. So first of all, I wanted to say that we'll be filing a proxy statement soon, which will have more details about today's proposal. But for now, I want to give a few broad strokes.","First off, as Larry said, what we announced today is basically a 2-for-1 stock split, and here's how it works. What we're doing is creating a new class of stock, Class C. That new stock will have equivalent rights to our existing Class A and Class B stock, except it will have no voting rights, and it will also be issued through a stock dividend on all Class A and Class B shares. So after the dividend, a stockholder who currently owns one share of Class A common stock with a single vote will continue to own that share plus one share of Class C capital stock that does not have a vote. Our existing Class A shares will continue to trade as they do now and the new class C shares will also be listed, so stockholders will be able to trade those shares, the class C, just as they can with the Class A shares today.","Now one thing to emphasize, because all stockholders will be treated equally and will receive one share of Class C for every share they now hold, everyone, including Larry, Sergey and Eric, will retain the same voting interest they had immediately prior to the dividend. And it's also important to note that as part of this, Larry, Sergey and Eric have all agreed to subject their shares to a transfer restriction agreement. This agreement maintains the same link between their voting and economic interest that exist today.","So if any of Larry, Sergey or Eric sell or transfer their nonvoting Class C shares, there's a stapling provision in the agreement that requires them to either sell an equal number of Class B shares or convert an equal number of Class B shares into Class A shares. Now the stapling requirement will end when their ownership levels fall below certain thresholds. So the basic thing to understand here is that the stapling provision is designed so that subject to these thresholds, the votes held by the founders and Eric will be reduced proportionally as their economic interest in the company declines.","Now a word about the process we used. Our Board of Directors carefully considered this proposal to create a new class of stock before reaching a decision. The process the board followed was robust and the deliberations were extensive. Back in January 2011, the board established a special committee comprised of independent non-management board members to consider this new class of stock or other alternatives. The committee met on numerous occasions over the 15 months that the special committee considered the proposal and that, that was separately from the board. The committee recommended and the board unanimously approved today's proposal.","In terms of next steps, the proposal\u2019s subject to the approval of a majority of the voting power of Google's common stock and they'll vote together as a class that will happen at our Annual Meeting on June 21 of this year. Given that Larry, Sergey and Eric control the majority of voting power and support the proposal, we expect it to pass. Following that, the board will set a record date for the dividend to move the process forward.","So for more detail on the proposal, you can find the Founder's Letter that Larry and Sergey issued this morning as well as a postscript from me on our Investor Relations site. And as I said, next week, we'll file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC, so you'll have even more details about today's proposal.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick to talk about the quarter.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Well, closing this first year with Larry leading Google as CEO, all of us at Google feel a renewed sense of velocity, focus and optimism in our Q1 operating, but also financial results are a good reflection of this spirit.","So let's jump right into the financials. Our gross revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $10.6 billion, 1% quarter-over-quarter, and our Google websites also grew. Revenue grew 24% to $7.3 billion, with strength across most major geographies and verticals. Google's Network revenue was up 20% year-over-year to $2.9 billion, 1% quarter-over-quarter. And Network revenue was still negatively impacted by the search quality changes we began to make a year ago in late February, otherwise known as Panda. Other revenue was up 56% year-over-year to $420 million and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate paid-click growth was very strong, just shy of 40%, up 39% year-over-year, and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate cost-per-click growth was down 12% and down 6% quarter-over-quarter.","So given the recent trends in CPCs and clicks, allow me to spend a bit of time today addressing this. The most important thing for you to understand is that our business is healthy. We believe that shifts in CPC and paid clicks taken independently really do not reflect the fundamental health of our business. Now allow me some details on this. In general, we attribute these trends to a combination of really 5 core factors. Those include FX, and then there's 3 mix effects. For example, the mobile versus tablet versus desktop shifts, emerging markets versus developed markets shifts and even the basics of google.com versus our network. And then finally, ads quality changes which is also a huge factor. So as you can see, it's a complex set of dynamics with multiple variables at play.","Many in the financial community have tried to isolate or often I hear pick one of these among these factors as the primary driver for CPC or click trends. Some even say it's about -- all about mobile. Others suggest that it indicates weakness in demand for Google advertising. Well, on the latter point, I want to be very clear that that's not the case. One important signal we have for advertiser demand is bidding behavior. And in fact, our advertisers\u2019 bid continue to be very strong and are growing.","So the dynamics around CPCs and paid clicks are just simply very complex because of all of these big factors and change continually. So trying to pick a horse, so to speak, just doesn't make sense. We internally track all these factors with the help of a number of statisticians, economists and engineers who dig into all these details on an ongoing basis. So we won't go into that level of detail every quarter, but again, the key thing to understand is that we believe that shifts in CPC, or paid clicks taken independently, simply don't reflect the fundamental health of our business, which we believe is actually very healthy. If anything, the recent lower CPCs present a great opportunity for advertisers to get an even better return on their ad spend. And lower cost, better ROI attract advertisers and thus, this is good for Google for the long term as well. So enough said on CPCs and paid clicks.","Let's just turn to geographic performance. The U.S., U.K. and rest of world are growing still at good pace as reflected in our results. In our earnings slides, which you'll find on our Investor Relation website, you see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., U.K. and rest of world that showed the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.","Our revenue in the U.S. was up 22% year-over-year to $4.9 billion. Our non-U.S. revenue accounted for 54% of our total revenue or $5.8 billion, up 26% year-over-year, which includes modest $37 million benefits from our hedging program. The U.K. was up 19% year-over-year to $1.2 billion.","Let me now turn to expenses. Our traffic acquisition costs were $2.5 billion or 24.5% of total advertising revenue. Our other cost of revenue was $1.2 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of $74 million. And finally, operating expenses excluding SBC again, totaled $3 billion. SBC totaled $482 million for the quarter, and the increase year-over-year in OpEx was primarily due to payroll, increased advertising and promotional spend and professional services.","So as a result of all this, our non-GAAP operating profit was $3.9 billion for Q1, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin slightly above 37%. These robust margins give us the confidence to continue to fully fund the strategic growth areas such as mobile, Android, YouTube, Chrome, all the areas that Larry talked about. And Nikesh will go into more details of these initiatives in a minute.","Turning to headcount, which was approximately 610 for the quarter, and we ended up the quarter with roughly 33,077 employees, full time. Our effective tax rate was lower this quarter, 18%, and this reflects the mix of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries and hedges and also some capital gains offset by carried over capital losses.","So now let me turn to cash, cash management. Other OI&Es or other income and expenses was $156 million for the quarter, positive, and it reflects a higher realized gain on our investments, offset somewhat by lower interest income and by the impact of our FAS 133 expenses from our hedging program. For more details on OI&E, once again, I refer you to the slides that accompany us on our IR website.","Operating cash flow was very strong, $3.7 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $607 million versus last quarter at $951 million. The majority of our CapEx spend was related to production equipment this quarter, as well as data center operations and facilities. And as a reminder, we will continue to make significant CapEx investments, and these have shown to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, mostly depending on when we're able to make these investments. So in total, very pleased with our free cash flow, $3.1 billion.","Let me close with my usual reminder that our revenues typically exhibit seasonality in the first half of the year, while our expenses do less so. So it's just a forewarning for everybody who's kind of tuning their models.","I'll hand off now to Nikesh who will cover in more detail our business performance in the quarter. Additionally, since Susan, who is typically on the call, is on a well-deserved spring break with her family this week, Nikesh will also cover some of the product highlights, primarily in Ads.","With this, I'll turn it over to Nikesh.","Nikesh Arora","Thank you, Patrick. I will now give you an update on our business activities. As Larry and Patrick have mentioned, we had another quarter of excellent performance, resulting in $10.6 billion of revenue this quarter. Our results are actually reflective of 3 major trends that are happening in the online advertising space, so let me just touch upon those.","First, we're seeing a big move to solutions. Our clients and partners more and more want complete solutions that work across all screens: desktop; mobile, tablet; and in the future, television. And also work with all kinds of formats, whether they're search, display or video ads. It's like having individual solutions for different devices and formats. So we're driving our teams to sell solutions across the entire marketing funnel. From building brand awareness to conversions, we are converging our teams of over 8,000 people to setting these complete solutions in 60 countries, making us one of the largest online solutions player.","Secondly, the big trend is we're seeing a breakthrough on brands. More than at any point in the last decade of online advertising, we're at a point where major brand advertisers, from movie studios to CPG companies, are finally looking to digital media as a central part of their marketing efforts. We are making huge progress. YouTube has gone from an interesting ad buy to key buy for brands. In May, we'll be hosting our first upfront for brands and agencies, showcasing the latest channel content and opportunities for marketers, something television has been doing forever. We will do that for YouTube in New York.","And third, we're beginning to see a trend on cross-media measurement. Social advertising has always been highly measurable, and we have been leading the industry in extending the measurability, not only in Search, but in Display, Mobile and live video. We are actually taking that one step further and trying to move that measurability into offline sales. Our experience is that businesses may allocate experimental budgets to new areas, but they invest serious money only when they can measure the results. We are rolling our best-of-breed measurement technologies so all clients can measure their ROI, whether their goals are online conversions, brand lifts or just the ability to compare offline and online media.","Let's talk about some specific product areas. Search, our Desktop Search business has maintained robust growth with strong traction with our top partners around the world even in the face of economic uncertainties that we've been noticing in Europe. I think search advertising has broken through that sound barrier of being an online channel, which now finally proven to drive in-store sales. For example, we partnered with IKEA in Italy in a study showing that each click on a paid search ad generates $7.60 of revenue. And then interaction with paid search in conjunction with television drives 20% of contribution to sales. And there's a lot of room to improve on that, but it's a cut clear demonstration of how online advertising is no longer just restricted to online sales but also having a huge impact in the offline world.","Last week, we launched a range of features to improve location targeting so that marketers can reach users by zip code or have their physical location show up more prominently in their ads.","In sales, I want to highlight Google Analytics, which is an unsung hero. Over 10 million marketers and websites globally use Google Analytics to measure the effectiveness of their online presence in real time. From large e-commerce sites to small blogs, that means that our technology is at the heart of over 10 million businesses, helping them get the most out of the Web.","Last quarter, we made several important improvements to Google Analytics, helping marketeers to measure the impact of the traffic from across over 400 social networks. I didn't even know there are 400 social networks.","Let's talk about Display. On Display, we saw a robust revenue growth as our clients continue to see the value of integrated advertising solution in driving business results. For example, we signed a deal with Unilever in Brazil for a campaign that ran across all Google properties, including YouTube, Search, Google Display Network and Gmail. We also recently partnered with leading sportswear company, Reebok, to develop a global display campaign across YouTube, Mobile -- YouTube and AdMob -- and mobiles, YouTube as well.","On the platform side in Display, we continue to make progress. We are now the leading platform provider for agencies and publishers to help drive their business using display advertising. We are focused in building unified buying and selling platform that helps them manage their advertising across all media much better than they have been able to in the past.","Our good relationships with our clients are helped by rapid product development and innovation. Last quarter, we launched the Google Display Network app in AdWords, which makes it easy for all AdWords clients to build, monitor and find display campaigns across millions of sites in our network. This is helping bring the world of search and display even closer.","Let's take a minute to talk about YouTube. As I mentioned, YouTube is an amazing success story. It's gone from an interesting buy to an obvious buy. Our watch paid sales have accelerated, particularly in key emerging countries, but also in mature ones. Today, most of our in-stream ads in YouTube are skippable, while our TrueView ad format, which is fast becoming an online video standard. It's great for users and it's great for advertisers. For example, the U.K. mobile operator O2 is actively now using YouTube to support their brand launch. They're using several YouTube products, including TrueView YouTube Mobile. They even live stream the New York -- sorry, the New Year Eve's concert from the O2 arena in London globally in YouTube.","In addition to this, we're also rolling out our 100 new original channels in YouTube, featuring top talents like Jay-Z, Madonna, Tony Hawk, as well as innovative new media companies and YouTube's new own successful partners. We think YouTube is fast becoming the platform for the next generation of talents, which is great because we're also seeing initial success selling the sponsorship for these channels to large advertisers such as Toyota, Unilever, GM as all in anticipation of the big upfront event coming up in May.","Let's change gears and talk about mobile. Mobile is quickly becoming a backbone of many clients overall advertising strategies and has huge headroom to grow. We continue to innovate with our product offerings with a number of new tools for advertisers. One development we're particularly excited about is our new enhanced click-to-download formats. This format in Search helps marketeers and developers promote apps. These things help improve ROI to provide users with more relevant download information about apps such as star rankings, pricing, et cetera, and all this happens right in the ad creator [ph]. So we keep actively working to help develop the mobile ecosystem from enabling mobile commerce to empowering local businesses.","In Q1, we began to scale our GoMo campaign, which is our Go Mobile campaign. This initiative helps businesses get more and more assertive and set up great mobile websites so they can keep driving traffic to those websites and expand their businesses. We've done these efforts across the world in North and South America, in Europe, in Asia and Africa.","Moving beyond advertising. Our Enterprise business also saw excellent progress as large organizations and small businesses continue to see the value of Google Apps as a cost-effective and feature-rich productivity suite. Some of our top customers to go Google in Q1 include global pharmaceutical company Roche, more than 90,000 users; the State of Colorado, which announced they intend to move 26,000 employees and users to Google; also the University of Pennsylvania and Rome have gone Google. Not only that, small business adoption of Google Apps is on fire, with SMB signups almost doubling in the past 6 months. So we're happy with the business and we're happy with the way Enterprise continues to progress.","Let me go back and show some more color on the country performance, as Patrick also talked about. From a regional perspective, we saw generally stable performance in the Americas. We saw a sustained traction in most parts of Europe and we saw acceleration in Asia, all this was driven by strong performance from our long tail Sense sales channel. Growth in North America was steady and this certainly was boosted by seasonal events such as Super Bowl, Valentine's Day, tax season. Canada was a little slower. Of course, Western Europe was robust in spite of the macroeconomic conditions. We continued seeing good growth in the U.K. Germany, France and Italy grew slightly less quickly than before. We saw strong acceleration in Asia. Japan grew faster this quarter, led by successes again, in our small and medium client base.","Let's talk about marketing and our partnerships business. Our marketing and partnership teams continue to support the fantastic growth we've seen this quarter across all of our business lines, products and services. We continue to roll out initiatives to support of Google+, which Larry talked about. We rolled out our That's the plus campaign with spots airing during the Grammys, the Oscars. Google+ and Hangouts are getting great traction. We have President Obama, we have Governor Romney, they both conducted very successful Hangouts in the platform. Even NASCAR held a Hangout ahead of the Daytona 500. But the most interesting was Seaview Survey, it had underwater Hangout live from the Great Barrier Reef. It's amazing to be able to see our great products like Hangouts be so successful. I recommend that all of you try Hangout soon.","As Larry mentioned, we also launched Google Play, which provides users one place to find, enjoy and share apps, music, movies and books instantly anywhere across the Web and on the Android devices. To support the launch, we are on a 7 days to Play promotion, offering discounts and apps and media, and our YouTube video has received over 3 million viewers to date. Our partnership teams also kept its great work, supporting our products by being very close to our partners. For example, we launched Google Street View in Russia, which lets users walk around the historical centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg. And we are also thrilled that this quarter our Google Cultural Institute help bring Nelson Mandela's archives online. We expand our successful art project to include new museums from the Getty Museum in L.A. to the museums in Paris and Qatar. Project now provides access to more than 30,000 ultra-high resolution images, paintings, sculptures and photographs in 151 museums and other institutions in 40 countries.","So in closing, I think Q1 was an excellent quarter. It has led us off to a very good start for 2012. We look forward to continuing to serve our users, customers and partners for the rest of 2012 and beyond. Also, I want to say thank you to all the Googlers and our global business team, all of our partners in the product and engineering teams that allow us to make these wonderful things happen and allow us to continue to drive the business.","With that, thank you, and I'm going to hand you back to Patrick.","Patrick Pichette","Thank you. So Jamie, our operator, is going to give us the instructions to get to the Q&A. So Jamie, why don't we just jump right in?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.","Spencer Wang - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two quick questions. First for Patrick. You mentioned the headcount growth was only about 600 this quarter. That's obviously slower than what you saw in 2011. Should we -- is this roughly the pace we should expect for 2012 or were there perhaps some timing factors? And then secondly for Larry, you talked about Google+ unifying the Google product. So when you think about things like Google Wallet and Offers, the mobile strategy maps, do you think of these as individual products or are they part of perhaps a broader local strategy? And if so, how do they fit together?","Patrick Pichette","Perhaps why don't I just jump on the technical question, then let Larry get to the second one. So look, I think that the headcount fluctuations, you'll remember last year when Larry said that we were at what was the kind of the edge of what was tolerable. And look, this short-term variability is actually the very best proof point that we don't manage kind of quarter-to-quarter and try to smooth things out. It just happens that in the first quarter, at this time of year, it's a bit different than when you come back in Q3 when you have all of the graduate students that actually start with us, so there's a bit of fluctuations there. So I wouldn't read that much into the numbers, but we're basically continuing to push on plan for hiring for this year.","Larry Page","And the question, I guess, about our products. I think we're working very hard, and I've talked a lot about this to make our Google experience be more unified and feel like one great experience for people. And many of the products you mentioned, Google Wallet, Offers, Maps, I mean, they apply kind of across many of the things we do. And so I think you'll see better integration of those products over -- through the rest of our products has already exist with Wallet, for example, across many different parts like Google Play and so on. And I think you'll see that increasingly happen over time just as we make these experiences better. They'll come up when you expect them to come up and when they make sense for users. I think that's definitely a big area of focus for us.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with Citi.","Mark S. Mahaney - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two quick questions. First, in terms of appealing to major brands, and Nikesh I think you talked about how you're seeing major brands engage more with YouTube and other assets. Could you talk about how you're trying to go after those dollars? Are there new things that you're doing now that you weren't doing 2 years ago to kind of accelerate that momentum? And then just real quickly on the mobile CPC issue. Can you just comment again on over time, over what period of time you would expect mobile and desktop CPCs to merge or do you think that's a realistic expectation? What would cause that to happen or not?","Nikesh Arora","Let me take the first question quickly, then I'll give you a little color on the second one, then Patrick can jump in. In terms of what we're doing differently, as I mentioned, YouTube has gone from being an interesting place where brands to be to being a must-buy. So we're seeing tremendous demand for inventory, which is brand related. And for the most part, the online world in the past has been more performance related i.e., people wanted to get some transactions, they wanted to get more people to their website. Now they're seeing the benefit of using the Web for brand affiliation and for brand recognition. So we are beginning to have a different sales pitch with the large brands, which is oriented towards them coming and getting their brands seen a little bit, and YouTube is a phenomenal tool in that regard, which acts sort of like an anchor property. Then we're able to package our demographic base inventory around the Google Display Network, around YouTube and actually get the brands to engage in the large campaigns, which can run the millions of dollars. This was a capability we couldn't have a few years ago because the inventory didn't exist or the demographic tools didn't exist. So clearly, this is a new space and a new sort of pitch to our brand advertisers. As I said, we are trying to light this up across our sales force around the world in 60 countries.","Patrick Pichette","No, we just have -- let's go through the mobile CPC question. So Mark, I think that this one is -- think of it as so much upside for us because essentially mobile is exploding in query growth and the formats themselves are just adapting already a lot and from a relatively crude base to so much more in the future. So that you're absolutely right that right now they don't monetize as well because we're kind of in what search used to be in 2002, 2003, 2004. So as these formats kind of continue to get better and better, we'd expect much better performance on them.","Larry Page","This is Larry. I'll add something, Mark. I think the mobile CPCs -- I mean, people always spend their most effort on the major -- whatever the major source of traffic or revenue is, and those are growing really quickly, albeit currently, obviously, there's more on desktop. I think over time as a reverse, and I think that the ability to kind of on your mobile to do local kinds of transactions, to really easily communicate with people and to do the kind of capabilities you have on your mobile device. And the fact that you spend most of your money locally, I think that over time that may actually reverse and the CPCs action may get better. But I think we're very bullish about that. We're making a lot of investments in that area, in things like Offers and so on and Wallet. And we're very, very excited about the potential there, and also Click-to-Call and other things that we do. So I think, for example, it's a lot easier to call someone from your mobile than it is from your computer right now. And so if that's how you're relying for transactions, actually mobile CPC should be higher for that. So I think you just haven't seen the focus on it and we're moving more and more focused on to that, both on our sales side and our customers are moving focus onto that, but I'm very, very bullish on that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research","Larry, in your 2012 update letter, you speak of all these notions of changing the world and ambitious goals on risky projects and having a healthy disregard for the impossible. Without getting into too much detail, at a high level, what types of projects is Google working on that would really surprise us? And are you remaining committed to the 70\/20\/10 rule where these noncore areas might get only 10% of the investment? And then separately, just on the google.com TAC, please, that continues to increase as a percentage of Google revenue. Is most of that coming from payments to mobile partners? And given the growth of mobile, should we expect that to continue to increase meaningfully?","Patrick Pichette","Do you mind, Larry, why don't I answer the last one first because it's really easy and then you can jump on the rest. Look, on TAC, if you look at our percentages -- as a percentage of revenue year-over-year, I mean it's basically stable. I mean, it moves a little bit here and there and you have partner mix and FX mix between mobile and others, but it's not actually changing in any dramatic way. So what you have to see in there is just the regular mix of both traffics and partners that come in and out all the time as well, so that I wouldn't read too much into that. I'll let Larry answer the real sexy question.","Larry Page","I think I didn't mention specifically the 70\/20\/10 in my letter. I should have, that's a good addition. So we definitely still see a -- most of our resources should be going to our core businesses, which really Search and Ads and a few of those things I mentioned that's really fallen to that core, I think. And then there's 20% kind of near things and maybe another 10% on the really speculative things. Through our whole history, we've really struggled this and have 10% kind of on the speculative things. Generally, it's much lower than that. I think the real thing that's needed on those projects is some management. Those take up bandwidth. You saw our announcements of Google Glass last week, which I was very excited to go out. You've seen the driver with his car kinds of things. And it does our take our executive time to deal with those things and so on, and so I think that's the real investment we make rather than being huge amounts of dollars on those kinds of things generally. We've got a limited number of things we can do. As I've been saying, we've been trying to focus. So trying to make sure that we have the right speculative bets as well as the right bets we're making on our core products and so on. And I'm pretty excited about our ability to do that. And I think it's hard coming from the outside because I mentioned in the letter I published today that Android took 3 years, plus 3 years kind of to really get to where it is today. That's 6 years, and you all haven't seen android, right, for those 6 years. We've seen it for those 6 years and we really invested in it. It's not so much money at the earlier stages, but attention. And that's an important, I think, discipline for the company to have.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Pitz with UBS.","Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Similar to detail on cost-per-click, would you discuss the key drivers of higher paid-click growth? Is it quality changes, Product Listing Ads or something else? And more broadly, maybe you can discuss how Product Listing Ads do impact results as we're tracking a substantially higher number of these ads on your site?","Patrick Pichette","Without giving -- look, the short answer is yes, and that's what the core answer of my message to the market was today. I think that you have a combination of international factors. You have a combination of new formats. Ad formats drive a lot in terms of paid clicks. If you think of even the sitelinks' extensions that we've -- like we have a new generation of sitelinks for this quarter, right? This is a perfect example of a product where by adding additional lines that are more targeted, so instead of having just kind of, trucks or -- and then you go down into the second layer, right, you have less CPC for that additional sitelinks. But if it's a better ad, people click a ton more on them. So it is really all of those 5 factors that actually drive them. And that's why we're continuing to kind of be pretty happy with the health of the net effect, which is real growth. Certainly, internationally, I mean it also -- you can see our mix between international and non-international. And that's driving it as well. So you have all these factors at play. And we're pretty happy with what we're doing there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.","Douglas Anmuth - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two things. First, just want to follow up on the question on mobile and TAC. If you could help us understand beyond CPCs how the economics of mobile are different and perhaps a little bit more detail on how you're paying OEMs and carriers. And then secondly, any updated thoughts on the cash balance and an update perhaps on the split of U.S. and international cash?","Patrick Pichette","Let me start with the last one first. We don't give the breakdown of our U.S. cash. We do it kind of irregularly, so we haven't done so of late. We have -- we continue to have a very strong cash balance, both U.S. and international. You'll notice, if you go into the details of our cash balance and on our balance sheet, right, we have just slightly under $2 billion of sec lending programs. So when you really, really look at our net cash balance, you got to take that sec lending out because it's on both sides of the balance sheet. But for the rest of it, incredibly healthy cash balance, both domestic and international. And Nikesh, do you want to give a quick update on the mobile CPCs and their mix?","Nikesh Arora","Yes. I mean, again, I'm not going to talk about specific of the TAC on mobile. But as you know, we get people using our devices both organically as well as through our distribution partnerships with carriers and OEMs. And typically, the OEMs and carriers participate in some of the economics that are on the Android marketplace or Google Play and some of them participate in the economics around Google Search just the way we would do syndication on the Web platform, which you do with many partners around the world. We have similar deals on the mobile front. I think in the mix, it comes out. This sort of washes out and it sort of adds up into our number which we show in -- our total number of green desktop and mobile. But mobile is no different from the way the desktop business operates out there.","Patrick Pichette","And we benefit from the terrific growth.","Operator","And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.","Carlos Kirjner - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two questions, if I may. If you think of the future of Internet search 3 or 4 years out, how important will the social signal be and how important your personalization be? In other words, would the company with the best social signal be able to offer the best search? And if the answer to that question is no, why is Google investing so much in Google+? And second question, if I may, you probably end the year with about $50 billion in cash and marketable securities and that will give you quite a lot of strategic flexibility. Given that, what's the rationale to continue to increase that amount on market on cash to shareholders?","Larry Page","I'll take the first part, Carlos. I think the -- this is Larry, and I think it's a very good question. And I think one of the things actually had in my remarks when I took out was to talk a little bit about Search and just enough time to put it all in. And I actually covered the question you're asking. I think one of the most amazing things I think we can do today that we couldn't do even a few months ago is to really -- I have this friend Ben Smith, right, who's a person at Google. He has kind of a common name. Now when I do a search actually, it finds the right person and it puts him in the search box. So for the first time, the search box isn't really doing searching a string, just the sequence of letters. It's actually searching for that person that I know. Now it's not, obviously not all the searches you do, but being able to search for people well is important. And knowing -- having real feedback from users about what they like and don't like and things they're sharing and so on is very useful for search. And we have a lot of those signals already, but we can always use more signals. We can always use better relevance and we can always use more data to generate that. So I think it is very important. I think it's not -- think social data about identity and ability to easily share things with other people and comment on them and things like that is a basic utility for people in all of our products. And that's where I was talking about Google+ really working across all of Google for identity and sharing and notification and other things that it does really well. So that all applies to Search and I think it's important for Search. I think search is going to change a lot. We're going to make it a lot better over the next 5 or 10 years as it's changed a lot in the past. And it will include a bunch of those signals and a bunch of other things as well.","Patrick Pichette","Carlos, why don't I take the next one, the issue of our cash balance. We have a healthy cash balance, I had mentioned a minute ago, and we still believe  that it's an incredible strategic asset for us. You saw it last year when we decided to make the purchase of MMI, and we continue to monitor this cash balance. And for the time being, we really believe that, that strategic asset has a ton of value. So we'll continue to monitor it and we have a process by which we actually review it on a regular basis with the board, and those questions are always asked. So we have a good governance process around it. But for now and the time being, we have nothing to announce on it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering, Larry, if you could walk us through your view on Google's tablet strategy via Android and the relative importance of having success with these devices in terms of achieving your long-term goal?","Larry Page","Heather, that's a good question. I think that we're very excited about tablets. I think there's a number of Android tablets out there and obviously, we have strong competition there as well. I think you've seen us really invest substantially also in things like Google Play, which really give you great access to entertainment, media, books and videos and so on, and as well as the apps. And we think that's an important component of what we're doing. I think there's also -- obviously, there's been a lot of success on some lower-priced tablets that run Android, maybe not the full Google version of Android. But we definitely believe that there's going to be a lot of success at the lower end of the market as well with lower-priced products that will be very significant. And it's definitely an area we think is important and we're quite focused on.","Operator","And we'll go next to Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have one for Larry and one for Patrick. Larry, Android is obviously a key focus. You talk about it a lot in your letters. Can you help us understand the strategic value for Google since you're not licensing it? Do you see more revenue per device if it runs on Android or lower TAC or what else can you tell us about what the real advantage to Google's advertising businesses? And then Patrick, obviously, higher in CapEx in Q1 this year, a lot lower than Q1 last year. Can you tell us if you factor in your revenue growth when you make that spending decision, your outlook? Does that -- give us any clues on your outlook for revenue growth over the next couple of years?","Patrick Pichette","Why don't I jump on the -- because mine again is not a very strategic one, it's more how we proceed. Look, it's lumpy because there's just timing decisions, right. We would -- there's probably a few areas where we would have like to actually make investments in Q1 and for a bunch of logistics reasons or otherwise, we couldn't. And so -- and you'll notice that's why there's kind of like $350 million difference between Q4 and Q1. And you should just expect it to be lumpy and that's just the nature of -- data centers are kind of big and clunky. And when you buy some piece of real estate, it's big and clunky. So there is quite a bit of variability into it. But we're -- again, I wouldn't take any one data point to start making a trend out of. So it's tough for, but I think that you can see we're committed to capital. If you look at the last couple of years, we've really made kind of significant investments and we'll continue to do them because it's a real strategic asset to us as well. So I'll let Larry answer the first question.","Larry Page","Justin, I think on your questions about Android, I think they're pretty short-term focus and I think it's good to think about the longer-term issues. We don't get very many new operating systems, kind of only a few in my lifetime, and I think they're pretty important. And I think Android's really about increasing the pace of innovation, usage of mobile devices and our ability to get a great user experiences out to our users, which I think we're doing a great job of. I mentioned over 850,000 devices per day are going out. And it's important to remember we're very early stages of that like we've only -- I'm amazed the computer that I'm carrying in my pocket is as good as the one I had a few years ago on my desktop. And I think we're only at the very, very early stages of what's possible with those devices. And I'm excited about a whole bunch of things we're doing in that area. We already mentioned kind of things like I said I'm very bullish about CPCs will improve on mobile over desktop due to all those capabilities. And so I think the benefits we get from Android are a lot. I mean, obviously, we have great integration with our products and Search and Google+ and photo uploading and there's a hundred things that we do really well on Android that benefit us across the board and across our users across the board and our products across the board. And I think that's going to continue to be the case. And I think it does lead to better economics for us too because we're providing amazing experiences for people that are well integrated and work well and they demand. So that's -- I'm very positive on all those things.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank.","Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Larry, just wondering as you look out on a very long term kind of 5-year view, do you see tablets taking perhaps the majority of home Internet usage? And if so, how strategically imperative is it for Android to have a big success in the tablet space given partner TAC could impose a high cost to the extent Android doesn't have a hit?","Larry Page","Yes, I mean, I think I've sort of already answered this question previously about tablets. I think the -- I mean, like I said, I think it's an important area. I think your computing experience, obviously, if you have an Android phone or use Google a lot online or you care about all those things in terms of your experience. And so I think you're thinking about your user experience. You're thinking about across all the devices use. I think people are going to get a lot more devices. We see kind of a convergence between all the services on those devices. And right now, I feel like each device you got is kind of a hassle the deal with and you're thinking about each individual device and all the issues with it. And I think that's not really right. I think you're going to have a pretty unified experience and a great experience from a user point of view and you won't have to manage all these devices. So I think you want to think about all these screens around you working seamlessly and working well for you. And I think, obviously, tablets are important. We have Google TV obviously. Big screens are important, computers are important, phones are important. Everything, all those devices are important. And I expect that they'll work well together. So I think that's kind of how we would think about it, and I think it's -- I don't think any single device there is going to drive all the usage or all the kind of convergence that needs to happen.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ross Sandler with RBC Capital Markets.","Ross Sandler - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I had a question for Nikesh. Can you give us an update on the growth rate you're seeing today in your core Search business by small, medium and large advertiser tranches? I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that Japan had strong growth, primarily due to smaller advertiser tranche. So how does that growth look in the various advertisers' size buckets across your GOs? And then is the speed of small advertiser adoption increasing right now versus prior periods given all the new local products that you have?","Nikesh Arora","Yes, I mean, I think the one way to think about it is that fundamentally we have one auction, and that auction every advertiser participates, whether it's the small advertiser or large advertiser. So they way we think about it is that we try and go ahead and get more and more advertisers to see the benefit of online advertising and the solutions that we offer. So as more and more advertisers come into the auction, it drives the price up of the auction for both large and small advertisers. And the way to think about it is that there's a price as we talked about CPCs and paid clicks, but it's really the third variable that goes into it, how many advertisers can we bring into the auction and how many various things can we get them interested in, whether it's mobile, whether it's YouTube, whether it's Display, whether it's Search. So there has been a lot of effort we have put in from our end, both to get more small business online. We've been adding GXBO campaigns around the world where we get small businesses online. We've also been cleaning up our signup flows for our adverts products, which is a self-served product where really small business can sign up. We have been working on getting people to have more mobile sites and getting people out in the mobile campaign. So effectively, it's a lot of effort towards getting more and more advertisers into the ecosystem. And as that happens around the world, you will see seasonal patterns or some sort of spikes when we work harder on small businesses in one quarter in certain parts of the world. But eventually, it all benefits the auction and we see the trend over time ends up working the same way for large and small advertisers.","Operator","That final question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.","Anthony J. DiClemente - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one question for Nikesh or whomever wants to answer it. It seems like even though as you're shifting to mobile, you have this presumably double-digit pricing step down for CPCs. But in the Display world, certainly, that pricing difference could be even more dramatic. In some cases, by half or 2\/3. Prices getting cut on that shift to mobile. And so you guys at Google have the unique ability to compare and contrast the difference in price between like Search and Display and how the 2 are monetizing relative to desktop. And so any color on that comparison would be appreciated because I think there are folks out there that have a view that actually Search, core Search, monetizes better on that shift to mobile than Display does, and I would love to just understand that better.","Nikesh Arora","Yes, I mean, I guess -- let me try to just explain to it from the advertiser perspective. So what we're striving towards is advertisers are interested in ROI. Advertisers actually are not interested in whether they're on the mobile product, the Display product, the Search product on the Web or the Search product on mobile. So what we are fast converging towards is we're basically sitting down and understanding ROI targets of our advertisers. And then we have immense amounts of inventory at our behest, whether it's mobile inventory, on Display or Search or desktop inventory or even inventory to our network. And what we are trying to work towards is being able to dynamically allocate across these various products, what allows them to get the maximum ROI. In that case, they are sort of -- they don't really care about whether they got that transaction to happen off one platform, one format or the other. So that's what we want to aspire, and that works really well in performance advertising because there is a specific objective the advertiser has. On Display, on brand, it works slightly differently, obviously, because you're talking about CPMs. But generally, that's the way to think about it. In the long term, we think mobile will monetize better. And we usually don't see the difference happening on Display and Search as you alluded to. Larry, you want to add something?","Larry Page","I'm just going to close the call here, and I really thank everyone for spending so much time with us today. And thank you all for spending time with us today and for being so interested in Google. And now, I'll turn it over to the operator.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate your participation."]}}
