And finally, I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences, when events are scheduled, the dates, times, and presentations are posted on our Web site.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.","Don Slager","Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which exceeded the upper-end of our financial guidance. As a result of successfully executing our strategy, the Republic team delivered higher levels of pricing, reported positive volumes, grew earnings and free cash flow, improved return on invested capital and increased cash returns to shareholders. During 2015, we made significant progress on our multi-year strategic initiatives. These initiatives are designed to profitable grow our business, enhance the quality of our revenue, improve the customer experience and reduce costs.","Regarding our market position, we invested $193 million in tuck-in acquisitions, nearly 2 times our original goal. The transactions completed in 2015 represent annual revenue contribution of approximately $143 million at a post synergy EBITDA multiple of 4.3 times. And we acquired U.S. assets of Tervita, these assets serve as a platform acquisition in the E&P waste sector, with attractive long-term fundamentals and opportunities for future growth.","Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our Capture cloud-based pricing tool. And our entire salesforce has been trained on priority-based selling. Our sales program is designed to identify and to track customers that are willing to pay for our higher value service offerings. Additionally, we now have over 500 contracts with approximately $250 million in annual revenue that use a waste-related index for annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and had consistently run higher than CPI. Most importantly, we are realizing the benefits of these revenue enhancing initiatives. During 2015, we reported our highest level of average yield in over five years.","Regarding our customers, we continue to see very encouraging customer engagement on our digital platform. For example, approximately 1.2 million customers have enrolled in My Resource, our customer portal and mobile app, which significantly enhances our customer interaction and connectivity. And we launched click-to-buy capabilities in approximately 50% of our residential subscription markets. Click-to-buy addresses the evolving needs of our customers\u2019 buying preferences and provides a lower cost sales channel.","Our customers see the difference in our products and services, which is reflected in our customer satisfaction metrics. Our Net Promoter score, which measures customers\u2019 willingness to recommend Company\u2019s products and services improved for the third year in a row. And finally, regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 16% of our total fleet now operate on natural gas, 72% of our residential fleet is currently automated and 78% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program, up from 60% a year ago. These initiatives require investment, but the payback is compelling and our financial performance reflects the benefits we are seeing.","Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50, which exceeded our expectations. Full year adjusted EPS was $2.06 and adjusted free cash flow was $830 million both exceeded the upper-end of our guidance. Core price in the fourth quarter was 3.4% and average yield was 2.2%. Average yield exceeded 2% in every quarter during 2015. Fourth quarter volumes increased 90 basis points this is the 11th consecutive quarter where we have grown price and volumes simultaneously. We returned $808 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during 2015. This includes approximately 10 million shares repurchased for 409 million. We finished the year with total shareholder return of 12.4%, which includes stock appreciation of 9.3% and dividends of 3.1%. Our TSR performance exceeded the S&P 500 average by over 8 times. We made substantial progress in 2015 and are proud of our strong results and many accomplishments, but we have more to do.","Last month, we announced the realignment of our organizational structure by combining two layers into one. This included the elimination of our three regions, the consolidation of 20 areas into 10 and streamlining select positions at our Phoenix headquarters. We are reinvesting back into our 10 area offices by creating additional operating and functional support roles which puts resources closer to our business and our customers. Additionally, we are investing in our customer service capabilities and are in the process of consolidating over 100 customer service locations into three customer resource centers. The new state-of-the-art facilities and technology will enable better levels of customer service across several touch points including voice, email, text, social and live chat.","The savings from the realignment are funding the investments we are making in our customer focused initiatives in 2016 and 2017. We expect these initiatives and realignment will contribute approximately $35 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018. Our ability to make these organizational changes is a natural evolution and logical next step for our Company. As a result of developing standardized processes with rigorous controls, we are further leveraging our scale to continually improve our service offerings. Additionally, we are able to maintain our high performance business culture with field management retaining full accountability and P&L responsibility. We call this approach the Republic Way, which we believe is the best way to create durable operational excellence and lasting value for all our stakeholders.","Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?","Chuck Serianni","Thanks Don. Fourth quarter 2015 revenue was approximately 2.3 billion, an increase of 61 million over the prior year. This 2.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 90 basis points and acquisitions of 1.8%. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, average yield growth of 2.2%; average yield in the Collection business was 2.7%, which includes 3.1% yield in the Small Container Commercial business, 3.8% yield in the Large Container Industrial business and 1.5% yield in the Residential business. Average yield in the Post-Collection business was 70 basis points, which includes landfill MSW of 1.5%. Core price which measures price increases net of roll backs was 3.4%; core price consisted of 4.4% in the open market and 1.7% in the restricted portion of our business.","Second, our volumes increased 90 basis points year-over-year; the Collection business increased 90 basis points, which includes positive contribution from the Large Container Industrial business of 2.8% and the Residential business of 40 basis points. The Small Container Commercial business was flat with the prior year. Our Small Container Commercial volume included a 40 basis point decline from non-regrettable losses of select national accounts and work performed on behalf of brokers. The Post-Collection business made up of third-party landfill in transfer station volumes increased 1.8%; landfill increased 2.1% which includes positive MSW volumes of 5.5% and C&D of 8.2%, offset by a decline in Special Waste volumes of 2.1%. The decline in Special Waste relates to same-store E&P volumes. Special Waste volumes excluding E&P waste streams increased 1%.","Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 170 basis points, the change relates to a decline in the cost of fuel which decreased approximately $33 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.44 in the fourth quarter from $3.57 in the prior year, a decrease of 32%. The current average diesel price is $2.01 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel cost through our Fuel Recovery Fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.","Finally, commodity revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to the decrease in recycled commodity prices. Average commodity prices for all materials at our recycling facilities decreased 16% to an average price of $95 per tonne in the fourth quarter from $113 per tonne in the prior year. Excluding glass and organics average commodity prices decreased 14% to an average price of $108 per tonne in the fourth quarter from a $126 per tonne in the prior year.","We believe excluding glass and organics is a better way to report average commodity prices, since they are low value waste streams and can skew the average price per tonne. Our sensitivity to changing commodity prices has always excluded the impact from glass and organics. Again I want to remind you that a $10 per tonne move in recycling commodity prices results a $0.03 annual EPS impact. On our Web site we posted the three year history of average commodity prices including and excluding glass and organics. Fourth quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 tonnes, represents the increase of approximately 14% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were up approximately 3%. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was relatively flat with the prior year.","Now I will discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.2%, which was down 80 basis points from the prior year. The change included a 50 basis point increase in SG&A expenses, primarily due to higher levels of incentive compensation and investments and initiatives. And a 30 basis point decline in EBITDA margin from lower recycle commodity prices. With respect to higher SG&A costs, the increased incentive compensation expense was due to financial outperformance during 2015. I also want to remind you that we expect the cost savings from the realignment to offset the investments in initiatives beginning in Q1, 2016.","On a full year basis EBITDA margin was 28.1%, an improvement of 10 basis points over the prior year. Margin expansion in the Solid Waste business of 90 basis points primarily due to lower fuel costs and pricing in excess of cost inflation, which partially offset by the impact of acquisition of 40 basis points and lower recycled commodity prices of 40 basis points, when looking at individual cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees and the sale of recycled commodity revenue. For example, the 2.2% decline in these revenues resulted in increases in labor expense of 40 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.","Fourth quarter 2015 interest expense was $93 million, which includes $12 million of non-cash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 34.3% in the fourth quarter and 37.2% for the year. In 2016, we expect to return to our statutory effective tax rate of approximately 39.5%. The increase in our tax rate resulted in $0.08 EPS headwind in 2016. Full year adjusted free cash flow was $813 million. This performance includes a cash tax benefit from the extension of bonus depreciation of approximately $65 million. We expect bonus depreciation will provide a cash tax benefit of $30 million in 2016 resulting in a $35 million year-over-year cash tax headwind.","Now I will turn the call back to Don.","Don Slager","Thanks, Chuck. Before I open the call up for questions, I will provide our 2016 financial guidance. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.13 to $2.17, which is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided last October. This continues to demonstrate the stability and predictability of our business. Our expected performance represents high single-digit earnings growth after excluding the $0.08 headwind from the increase in our effective tax rate. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in a range of 820 million to 840 million, which was upwardly revised from our preliminary outlook due to the extension of bonus depreciation. This performance represents mid to high single-digit growth after excluding the change in cash taxes.","We expect annual revenue growth of 2.5% to 3%, which includes average yield of approximately 2%. We believe this level of pricing is strong given the 30 basis point headwind from lowest CPI-based presets. Volume growth in a range of 1.5% to 1%, we expect our volume trajectory to be relatively consistent with our full year 2015 performance, with the exception of residential due to known contract losses. Residential volumes are expected to be slightly negative.","Contribution from acquisitions of 1%, this relates primarily to tuck-in acquisitions and the rollover impact from 2015 transactions. And a decline in fuel recovery fees of 1%, due to lower diesel prices. We anticipate an EBITDA margin of approximately 28.5%. This represents 40 basis points of margin expansion over our 2015 performance. 2016 net capital expenditures are expected to be $900 million or approximately 9.5% of revenue. This level of spending includes a $60 million benefit from cost effectively extending the useful life of our fleet, as a result of our One Fleet maintenance program. This is in addition to the $40 million of capital we saved during 2015. We anticipate investing $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions and we expect to return approximately $820 million of total cash to shareholders through $420 million of dividends and $400 million of share repurchases.","I would like to thank the entire Republic team for their contribution that allowed us to meet our objectives and positioned us well for future growth. During 2016, we will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders and remain focused on managing the business to create long-term value by executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation.","At this time operator, I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question today. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Al Kaschalk","I want to focus if I may on the volume guidance in particular I think broader thoughts for that the sector could grow about 1% to 2% in '16, maybe with some of these headwinds you are seeing in the broader economy that would have been a little bit too aggressive, but did you address the 50 basis points to 1% increase that you are looking forward in particular how large was the residential drop contracts that you lost?","Don Slager","Well, it's actually a couple contracts right, so this is just normal in our business Al and let\u2019s focus on residential for a second. We have made a lot of noise around the fact that the residential business has been the weakest for some time, the residential business some of those contracts again have CPI resets which don\u2019t really work us for us over the long-term. We have been very good public private partners with our residential customers, and we ultimately need to have contracts that work for both parties and so we are booking a very strong approach, if you are trying to get these contracts switched to a new index which we only talked about doing that successfully. And there are some contracts frankly that just don\u2019t work for us and so we are going to continue to be focused on return on investments, so the residential business can be a little bit weaker in '16 as a result of that. And again there is -- we have got so many contracts in total do we have in residential contracts it is thousands of them right. So that\u2019s just the nature of the beast and that is going to be a little lumpy from year-to-year.","The underlying economics we think are good, right. So you think about how we always talk about the fact that its population growth driving household formation and really is a critical metric in our business. If you look out at household formation it is strong, it prompts us to continue to remain strong as far as we are growing so that\u2019s good for us. The Special Waste business looks pretty solid that\u2019s a good indicator of a good economy and we have seen pretty consistent growth in even our landfill MSW business over the last year. I mean so I think we are in pretty good shape. You reported on the year 4 plus percent growth in MSW landfill which -- that is actually nice to have across the business. So we will continue to look for that and then with the capture tool and PBS we\u2019re being very selective about the kind of growth we\u2019re getting. And as I said in my remarks, that we are in the 11th straight quarter where we had both positive volume and pricing growth, and we think that\u2019s the magic where we get both end and we continue to get both end into the future and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused that\u2019s going to deliver the margin that\u2019s going to deliver the cash.","Al Kaschalk","If you slice the volume overall and I guess my question is a little bit more macro driven. But historically we\u2019ve known that C&D has been a big beneficiary to the RSG\/Allied network. How would you look that and say from either a manufacturing side, or what concerns should we think about and shareholders be aware of in terms of slower economy, what that may impact and in particular in what manufacturing verticals, how much are you exposed there?","Don Slager","Well, first let\u2019s step back from all of that and remember, I mean we tend to lag right so when things go up and down we kind of lag a little bit. But when we talk about our Large Container Industrial perm business that\u2019s mostly construction, it's a large container tank. When we talk about industrial large container perm industrial is kind of a misnomer because that includes a lot of commercial retail business, a large multifamily office buildings, hospitals anything that requires large container. Only a portion of that perm large container business is truly industrial right. And we\u2019ve continued to see strong performance in that permanent business both price and volume. So we\u2019re not concerned about that segment of our business.","Operator","Our next question is from Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Please go ahead.","Ken Wang","This is Ken Wang on for Corey. So just thinking about the incentive comp increase that you mentioned and looking at the labor cost as well which looked like they were up about 6% year-on-year. Was the incentive comps increase something that also had an effect on labor cost, just given the increase?","Don Slager","No, the incentive comp increase really occurred all in the SG&A line and that was due to the financial outperformance that we had during 2015. And obviously as we look at SG&A cost in 2016 we\u2019re not expecting that to repeat.","Ken Wang","And then in terms of the labor cost being up 6%, what was the driver there?","Don Slager","Sure, so keep in mind that 40 basis points of that is due to reduction in the fuel recovery fee and commodity revenue, so it is really revenue based and then the other 20% is really due to acquisitions.","Ken Wang","Okay, that\u2019s helpful\u2026","Chuck Serianni","Yes, so Ken when you think about revenues, because you\u2019re just looking at the straight dollar increase.","Don Slager","Is that right the 6% you\u2019re just taking a look at dollar-to-dollar is what you\u2019re looking at?","Ken Wang","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Don Slager","So I mean remember you got to think about there is normal inflation in the business and then when you think of on a full year basis when you look at our volumes, it's been heavily weighted to the Collection portion of our business. So there is a volume element to it. And then you have to look at the total amount of acquisitions that we\u2019ve completed during the year. Right so you add the three up together from the revenue perspective, because remember within the revenue you\u2019ve got the reduction from fuel recovery and fee and commodities, it does nothing to your labor cost. So you got to look at the revenue change exclusive of those and basically what you\u2019re seeing is a similar increase in labor expense, expressed as a percentage.","Ken Wang","And just one quick follow-up, do you have any comments on any changes you\u2019ve seen in competitor behavior, anything you\u2019re seeing either from large competitors or small competitors?","Don Slager","No, I would say really no change over what we saw at the end of last year. Generally speaking more broadly speaking, you know that we feel pretty good about sort of the rational behavior in the market generally. There is always A market or two, there is always a local competitor or two doing something, maybe making a bad decision or having debt -- actually they are making investment here and there. But overall, we\u2019re not concerned about it.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Levine of Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Scott Levine","So, last year I think you lowered off of your preliminary guidance for 2015 due to recycled commodity prices dipping here you\u2019re affirming the guidance. Just kind of wondering any appreciable changes in any of the assumptions or drivers beneath the surface of your business from 3Q to 4Q? Or is it really kind of status quo and no meaningful change in any particular area here?","Don Slager","No, actually there has been a change. I mean we look at our outlook and then look at our guidance right now. We\u2019ve got about a $0.04 decrease due to commodity prices, so pretty a significant decrease since we gave outlook. But we\u2019ve been able to offset that by lower fuel cost and also through other improvements in the business and that's what allowed us to keep our guidance consistent with our outlook that we provided in October.","Scott Levine","And as a follow-up, in your capital allocation plan for '16 have you outstanding free cash by a bit here you've come off to pretty active years for M&A just looking for your confidence level maybe that you can continue this out spend free cash flow and then grow the dividend and then still remain comfortable with where your balance sheet leverage is?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, we're very comfortable with the balance sheet leverage, so right now we're at 2.9 times, when we look at our capital allocation both in terms of dividend and share repurchase it\u2019s right in line with the free cash flow and they are still having the capacity that we need in order to pursue acquisition so we're very comfortable with the capital allocation strategy and very comfortable with being able to continue to increase our dividends in the future.","Don Slager","Yes, Scott this is Don, as it relates to the M&A right, we can talk about the pipeline of tuck-ins, we've got a pretty good handle we think on what is out there as it relates to tuck-in opportunities, but these larger opportunities that really drove the over I'd say that over spending but it's like we spend more in M&A last year those are lumpy right, those come to the market once in a while, so we don't really see, we don't have visibility to any of those today as we look at '16. And again we're always focused on first and foremost the tuck-ins in our current markets in our core business and that's what gives us the better return and lower risk et cetera, but it's just that we always want to maintain right strength in our capital structure, so that if the right thing does come along for us we've got the flexibility so we're very focused on that.","Operator","Our next question is from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tyler Brown","Hi Don, I want to talk about what I'm going to call your own idiosyncratic pricing story, so at this point, Capture has rolled out, everybody is through PDS, my resource has got increased penetration and I assume all of that would drive better customer loyalty. So given all that can you give us any metrics maybe even just directionally about maybe churn or spread between your lost business and going forward would we expect to see the gap between core price and average yield narrow?","Don Slager","Well, let\u2019s backup, first of all right, it's a pretty big denominator right, so if we talk about taking the faction from 7% which it\u2019s been the faction have been at an all time double-digit high, in the past we've got it down to 9, 8, now 7 it's been consistently 7 for some time. Driving that down to 6 would be quite a feat but we're focused on extending customer loyalty and perhaps that the faction is really competitive the other half is what we call structural business to close and things move offshore et cetera. We are really-really focused in on the quality of services we're delivering to our customers through meeting our customer commitments which is internal metric and then also Net Promoter score which as I said in my comments we have improved the Net Promoter score every year for three years so -- and we're very-very active in trying to understand how our customers think about us and then we brought forward not only better quality of service delivery but a better way of doing business with us through our digital platform. So, all those things are driven to improve the customer experience and then on top of that the tool set you described around PDS, Capture and also frankly the improved CRM tool that our team uses today makes them one or more efficient, more effective but also helps them to get basically the price for new selling to improve.","And that's what is happening with what we're seeing with price, with yield and with churn. That churn which is essentially the difference between business gained and business lost right the net difference has continued there to narrow, that has been a big part of our pricing story and we're going to continue to focus on that as we go through the years. The combination of all those things working towards, again extending the loyalty, reducing churn which ultimately means lower inflection and creating what we call internally rolling this effect right and then PDS is directing our sales teams at customers that we believe are in the segments that are more likely to buy value and less likely to be only priced customers. So, everything we've been talking about over the past couple of years is getting rolled out as we've been working for the greater good and it is reflected here in our best pricing ever in 2015 or in a long time it has been going on you know. And 11 straight quarters for both pricing and volume growth and as I said with another question, we're going to be focused on the right growth, right, targeted profitable unit growth. So, we're seeing it and then we're seeing market expansion, we're seeing good cash flow as a result, so that's as you called it what idiosyncratic right that is the word.","Tyler Brown","Chuck do you want to understand a couple of the underlying assumptions in the guidance. So, first off are you guys assuming about a $10 decline in commodities, is that right?","Chuck Serianni","A $10 from yes from what we actually saw in 2015, that\u2019s right.","Tyler Brown","Okay, and then are you expecting Tervita to contribute more or less EBITDA?","Chuck Serianni","It is going to be about the same, what we got is a little bit of a headwind associated with drilling activity and we are going to make that up through productivity gains and through the anniversarying of some integration costs.","Tyler Brown","Okay. And then lastly just do you have specifically what you are kind of expecting for open versus restricted market pricing?","Chuck Serianni","No, and you got to take a look at the performance Tyler I mean it's a similar level of performance in 2016 as we saw in 2015 with the exception of the step down in CPI-based pricing. But you can probably expect similar level of contribution.","Tyler Brown","Okay all right that\u2019s perfect, thank you guys.","Don Slager","And a subset of muni that we converted to a better index set right.","Operator","Our next is from Jeff Volshteyn of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Volshteyn","When we look at your congressional funding for infrastructure that was surpassed last year, there is a fair amount of enthusiasm about new conversations and new projects in infrastructure. Does that impact -- I mean do you think about that market as potential opportunity for you, does that impact your business in over the next so let\u2019s say three to five years?","Don Slager","It doesn\u2019t make a huge impact when you think about that infrastructure build funding roads and bridges. We do work for customers who build roads and bridges but that doesn\u2019t generate the same kind of waste volume that comes out of stack homes and multi-family homes and skyscrapers right. The weight that comes from building a site is not some things like expedition and point of concrete. But things like putting up starts and dry wall and permitting and installation and ripping those kinds of things generate waste for construction. So roads and bridges we have some containers at along some of these building sites but unfortunately for us we don\u2019t get to pull them very often.","Jeff Volshteyn","Just a few clarifying questions, on the reorganizational announcement or restructuring what is the timing of it through 2016, are there certain quarters where it is going to be more impactful?","Don Slager","Well let me start and I will let Chuck talk about how the numbers roll-in but reorganization is complete, right. So the reorganization is complete the organization is function under the new model and so basically we have the absolute lower cost of organization functioning today net of the onetime severances and relocations that some of the relocations have to occur over the next couple of months.","Chuck Serianni","So what we are saying is that the savings that we are going to receive from the realignment. Will really start in February and that\u2019s about $20 million or so, that\u2019s going to be offset by additional investments and initiatives, primarily due to our customer resource centers. So that will be an offset within our P&L. We are also going to have about $35 million of restructuring charges, $25 million of that are associated with the realignment that Don just talked about, a lot of that should be frontend loaded so more towards Q1, Q2. And then about $10 million of that associated with the customer resource center, that\u2019s going to be more spread out through the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael Hoffman","I have the sense that solid waste\u2019s operating leverage is a little bit matched by similar noise that happened throughout the year, if you were to strip away Tervita, how do you think about the solid waste profitability trend through the year and coming into 2016?","Don Slager","Michael let me start by going through some of the numbers, so if we just reconcile the EBITDA margin from '14 to '15, 2014 was at 28% and we got about 90 basis points of margin expansion this from the solid waste from the base business, a lot of that due to pricing above cost inflation and lowering that fuel. Now that was offset during the year by the recycling business which ended up being about 40 basis points, and by acquisitions of about 40 basis points. So to your question, you eliminate the cycling and you eliminate the 40 basis points from acquisition it gives you a better idea of where we think the true margin potential is of the business of the base business.","Michael Hoffman","Okay that\u2019s very helpful. And then within the cash flows sort of discussion, you finished this year's cash flow from operations with a nice healthy 18.4% of revs that is a nice healthy increase year-over-year, and really there is a nice deferred tax from tax furnace depreciation that -- but your guidance for next year looks like you are retaining a lot of that, it's still over 18% so it's you might want it down a little bit year-over-year it's still over 18 which is up on a long-term basis so is that a sustainable permanent trend here now, you\u2019re 18% or better CRC of ops going forward?","Don Slager","Yes, we would say that that is we believe that to be sustainable Michael going forward. We think about growing free cash flow on an annual basis somewhere in the mid to high single-digits is something we feel comfortable with and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing this year if you exclude the impact of bonus depreciation on both \u201915 and \u201916.","Michael Hoffman","And you are -- and I think I misunderstood your commentary or I didn\u2019t understand it. The 65 million was in \u201915 December and 30s in 18 so \u201916, is that what you were saying?","Don Slager","That\u2019s right. Yes, that\u2019s right Michael, that\u2019s right.","Michael Hoffman","Okay.","Chuck Serianni","And Michael maybe another way to think about this as well is that if you take a look at the 2016 guidance right for free cash flow of 820 million to 840 million, even though there is a $30 million benefit from the expense of the expansion of bonus depreciation, if you look at the in-year impact, right so from all prior years together with what was just extended, it's still a net negative in \u201916 to the magnitude of about $20 million. So if you want to kind of think normalized, you would take that guidance and add $20 million, that\u2019s a normalized level of free cash flow as bonus depreciation never existed at all.","Don Slager","Right so think about it your first question the underlying waste our business expanded 90 basis points again forget about some of the other noise. But the cash flow point you made is right on it and as you always say you get proper cash. You think about what we\u2019ve done in the business to shift the pricing to offset cost. We still got some good cost initiatives underway certainly the reorganization and CRCs are part of that. And ongoing improvements still in our product set and in our customer service overhang and so I continue to drive willingness to pay. So we\u2019ve shifted a gear here and now we\u2019re funding with some of those improvements funding the next wave of initiatives and so on. So I mean we think we\u2019re going to continue to do that year-on-year and at some point in the future there will be other waves of initiatives that we talk about still, just going to leave you so much more time. But we think we\u2019ve turned the corner on it.","Michael Hoffman","And just so I understood Brian\u2019s comment about what you were saying I think was the 813 less the 65 you\u2019ve normalized that it would still be plus 20 and then that grows to 830 would be the midpoint less 30, so it's still showing growth that\u2019s the point you\u2019re making [Multiple Speakers].","Don Slager","No, no I guess what I was saying Michael is that you just take the 2016 guide of 820 to 840, okay if you take a look at the in-year impact of bonus depreciation that we\u2019re going to see due to the reversal of prior years in \u201916 together with the in-year benefit from the extension, when you take the net impact of that, that\u2019s still a net negative $20 million to free cash flow or $20 million in higher cash taxes then that bonus depreciation never existed at all. So the notion of kind of what normalized would be in a normal tax environment it\u2019d be closer to 840 to 860 not 820 to 840, that\u2019s what I was saying.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Buscaglia","So, on your fleet savings programs, the 72% automated at 78% maintenance program. Do you expect those to be pretty much complete by the end of this year?","Don Slager","No the -- we\u2019ll have the let\u2019s take them one at a time. The automation right is focused on the residential part of our business going from multiple individuals working on accrue to single operator vehicles right. So, we\u2019ve moved that number up 2% or 3% a year. I think last year we converted what 200 or 300 routes to the single operator. So that\u2019s just been ticking up that thing will probably max-out somewhere at about 80% I\u2019d like to think I\u2019d give you a little better but some neighborhoods or some contracts just can\u2019t quite get there, so it's going to continue to tick up year-on-year until we are fully automated. The One Fleet initiative is going to be complete this year with all of our divisions being fully trained on One Fleet and then they\u2019ll be certified some of them will still be in the certification process into the venue next year. But we\u2019re seeing the benefits of the most mature sites that we talk about generally accruing the business so the longer these divisions are on the One Fleet program the better they perform. And not to mention right obviously the extension of the fleet the useful life of the fleet which has been a very methodical over our process and as I said in our comments we\u2019re continually taking advantage of that and as a result and our CapEx this year is only about 9.5% of revenue.","Chuck Serianni","That\u2019s right. So just put a final point on that and we had -- we are expecting a $200 million capital savings associated with the One Fleet program, $40 million of that we actually obtained in \u201915 and we\u2019re expecting another $16 million benefit in 2016.","Don Slager","And we originally said it would take four to five years to fully roll that out, so we'll take advantage of the extending the life.","Andrew Buscaglia","And then switching gears on the volume side, can you talk a little about your expectations specifically on the commercial volumes I know they were flattish this quarter, what are you seeing, are you expecting '16 for that segment?","Don Slager","Yes, we would say generally flat and we've got a couple of things going on in there. We have -- back in my comments earlier about more disciplined -- internal discipline on our end around price and volume, finding that right balance, really using the tools, the Capture tool et cetera, we as talked about in previous quarters the fact that we parted with some non-profitable national accounts business and we're going to continue to be very certain in our actions around that and we've also walked away from some broker relationships, those are third-parties who don't own trucks, they don't own containers, they don't own landfills, they have no risk, they bring no value to the customer and we've had some relationships there that we've had to part ways with and we're going to continue to be very selective of our partners and that will impact our commercial small container growth in '16 and in '17 frankly. But I mean we will continue to be flat at least for '16 and ultimately as our product continue to improve and everything else we'll get our fair share of growth and that's the thing we always say is what 240 markets , 42 states, we're in number one or number two market position, and about 93% of those as growth is there we get our fair share of growth and we want to focus that share on -- again customers who are in the right segments who value our quality and rolling effect.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Feniger of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Feniger","You got into EBITDA margins up 40 basis points, can you just walk us through some puts and takes on what's helping you really expand that margin in a very tough CPI backdrop?","Chuck Serianni","Sure, let me put a little bit of color first of all on fourth quarter margins and the EBITDA margin for Q4 2015 was 27.2%. Now included in that you'll see that we had higher SG&A cost, incentive comp was about 50 basis points higher, we had some legal settlements of about 20 basis points and we had some initiative investments of about 30 basis points. Now the initiative investments in 2016 are going to be offset by the cost savings from the realignment that I had talked about and we're not expecting the initiative comp, the incentive comp and the legal settlements to reoccur. So, just from that alone you're ending up with 100 basis points more in margin for the quarter. And we're looking at SG&A in 2016 closer to 10.5% and once again that has to -- it's a little bit higher than the 10% that we called out just because of some of the costs that we're incurring is associated with initiatives but after 2018 and getting the full benefit associated with both the realignment and the customer resource centers, we're expecting SG&A to be back in -- back to around 10%, so looking longer term, really we're going to be able to start leveraging our SG&A and that's what is going to be a primary driver of our margins going forward.","Don Slager","Yes. And Mike, just to kind of look at -- if you look at the full year-over-year what Chuck just described on the SG&A expenses that's probably 30 basis points of the 40 basis points of margin expansion from '15 to '16 just on SG&A and then the rest is basically just due to a better business performance.","Michael Feniger","And then with free cash flow coming in ahead in 2016 and a very healthy cash flow from operations, is there any thought about maybe taking up that tuck-in acquisition target of 100 million higher?","Don Slager","Yes so, we've got a target of 100 million as I said and we've got a pipeline -- each of our Area President's and our General Managers have responsibility to contribute to that pipeline with ideas around companies that might be interested in selling. You know I always say right, in order to gather the deal, one of the main components of having a good deal is having a willing seller right. And you need a willing seller, you need good synergy, real synergy, you'd like to get real assets and real property and real goodwill of customers, we don't like startups, we don't buy serial seller, we like the quality companies with recurring revenue and good assets and so there's a limit to what is out there and there's a limit frankly to owners who are willing to sell and they got to be at a point in their lives frankly where they are so, we're going to be as optimistic because we can be -- we think the tuck-in really looks like 100 million. It is something so much long that's it is not in our sites today, we'll let you know as the quarters tickle off, we always have the capability to do more and that\u2019s one of the reasons that we maintain our capital structure the way that we do. And again we are very focused on trying to grow the core and we know the value of tuck-in more business into already a very strong management team and really a strong asset base. So if it's there we will take a look at it.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Baumgarten of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Adam your line is live perhaps muted on your end.","Adam Baumgarten","Hi sorry guys, thank you [Multiple Speakers] just a quick question on the Post-Collection yield and it's pretty stable quarter-over-quarter despite a pretty nice pick up in MSW yield, can you kind a walk me through the put and takes there?","Don Slager","Let me back up and give you just a sense to it and then I\u2019ll let Chuck walk through the numbers. But remember that Post-Collection right includes right transfer and landfill and remember that a good portion of our landfill business today, MSW still comes through as municipal waste from municipal customers, right. And a lot of that business -- so these are cities who have their own trash fleets their own trucks quite and their own trash from rate payors. But they have no landfills and so unfortunately for us some of those contracts are still in with the CPI accelerators, so as we are thinking about moving to new indices that is the one of the areas that we will focus on overtime. In the other part of the business, the sort of the open market part of the rent business we do much better. But it's heavily weighted still towards that municipal waste product.","Chuck Serianni","Yes so the restricted piece of the business, the yield there is closer to 1% to 1.5% and then to Don\u2019s point the unrestricted price is probably closer to 3% or 4%.","Adam Baumgarten","And then just one quick one, should we expect any material impact on 1Q margins from the extra selling day?","Chuck Serianni","Yes we think that there is going to be a downward pressure on margins, higher cost I should say in Q1 because of the extra selling day. That\u2019s about 30 to 40 basis points.","Don Slager","And then the other thing again just to kind a keep in mind when you take a look at the first quarter is last year we got the benefit from the lag in the fuel recovery fee. And that was about $0.02 EPS benefit it contributed about 60 basis points to margin in the first quarter of '15. So when you look at the combination of the two just kind of something to keep in mind as you are looking at your model for next year for this year.","Operator","At this time there appear to be not further questions. Mr. Slager I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.","Don Slager","Thank you Emily, I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment, and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic Way.

Republic Services is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RSG.","Your hosts for today's call are Don Slager, President and CEO; Glenn Culpepper, CFO; and Ed Lang, Republic's Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Lang. Good afternoon, Mr. Lang.","Edward A. Lang","Thank you, Holly. Welcome, good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. This is Ed Lang, and I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services' Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Don Slager, our CEO; and Glenn Culpepper, our CFO, are joining me as we discuss our second quarter 2013 performance.","Before we get started, I would like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information we discuss on today's call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, and may be materially different from actual results.","Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. The material we discuss today is time sensitive. If in the future, you listen to a rebroadcast or recording of this conference call, you should be sensitive to the date of the original call, which is July 25, 2013.","Please note that this call is the property of Republic Services, Inc.

When presentations are scheduled, the dates and times are posted on our website, along with instructions for listening to the live webcast of the event.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we discuss Republic Services' Second Quarter 2013 Results. I am pleased with our performance, which continues to reflect an improvement in business conditions. Revenues increased 2.5% compared to the prior year, which includes volume growth of 0.9%. Both average yield and volume improved sequentially, and we remain well positioned to take advantage of an improving economy.","Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.43, which includes $0.03 of legal charges for various matters. Excluding legal charges, adjusted EPS would have been $0.46, which was in line with our expectations.","Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $312 million. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance.","Q2 average yield was 1.3%. This represents the fourth straight quarter of improvement. Core price, defined as price increases less rollbacks, was 3.1% in the second quarter. Q2 volumes were positive 0.9%. This represents a sequential improvement of 140 basis points. We expect to continue to see positive volumes in the second half of 2013.","Construction activity continues to improve. Temporary roll-off hauls were up 4.7% over the prior year and increased in most of our markets. As many of you know, the roll-off business tends to have a lower incremental margin. Operating density resides in the commercial and landfill lines of business due to the higher level of fixed costs, but volume in these lines of business tends to lag. We remain encouraged by recent activity in the roll-off business, since it has historically led to a broader volume growth.","Q2 recycling facility tons increased approximately 4% over the prior year. We completed an upgrade to a single-stream recycling facility in Ohio and completed a new single-stream facility in the Dallas-Fort Worth market. Combined, these new facilities will add approximately 95,000 annual tons.","The year-to-date investment in acquisitions was approximately $33 million. These transactions consist of tuck-in acquisitions in existing markets. We anticipate completing our goal of investing $100 million by the end of the year.","Year-to-date, we returned approximately $305 million to our stockholders through share repurchase and dividends. We repurchased 4.1 million shares for $135 million and have $189 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete in 2013.","In summary, the base business performed well, and we have now turned the corner on volumes. Our second quarter results put us right where we thought we would be, and we remain on track to achieve our full year adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance.","Glenn and Ed will now discuss our financial performance. Glenn?","Glenn A. Culpepper","Thanks, Don. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.43 excludes an $0.18 environmental charge for increased costs to remediate our closed Bridgeton Landfill in Missouri. The charge primarily relates to increased costs to pump and dispose of leachate, which will be spent over the next several years. We are on track to complete the remediation plan.","Adjusted EPS also excludes a $0.10 charge for negotiation and withdrawal costs related to the Central States Pension Fund that were completed during the second quarter.","Second quarter 2013 revenue was approximately $2.1 billion, an increase of $51 million from the prior year. This 2.5% increase in revenue includes acquisitions of 0.4% and reflects the following 3 components of internal growth: pricing, volume and recycled commodities.","First, pricing. We had an average yield growth of 1.3% with positive yield in all lines of business. Average yield increased 10 basis points sequentially from 1.2% in the first quarter of 2013. This level of pricing was in line with our expectations for the second quarter, and we remain comfortable with our full year guidance of 1% to 1.5%.","We conformed the terms used to describe pricing components to be consistent with other industry participants. What we previously called core price is now referred to as average yield. Average yield represents the year-over-year change in per unit prices, expressed as a percentage. Our calculation methodology has not changed.","Additionally we changed the term net price-to-customer to core price. Core price represents price increases to customers and fees, excluding fuel recovery, net of price decreases to retain customers. Again, our calculation methodology has not changed. Core price in the second quarter was 3.1%.","In addition, fuel recovery fees increased 0.2%. Most of the change relates to an increase in the rate charge to recover fuel costs, which went into effect in late Q4 2012.","Second, Q2 volumes increased 0.9% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1%, primarily due to increases in industrial volumes. Growth in the industrial line of business was driven by temporary hauls, which were up 4.7% over the prior year.","Growth in collection volumes was partially offset by a decline in post collection volumes of 0.6%. The decline is mostly due to lower levels of special waste at our landfills. Post collection volume performance improved 420 basis points from Q1.","Third, a decrease in commodity sales resulted in a 0.3% decrease in revenue. Commodity prices decreased approximately 11% to an average of $110 per ton in the second quarter from $123 per ton in the prior quarter. This represents the average price for all commodity types for all regions.","Second quarter recycling facility commodity volume of 554,000 tons was up 4% from the prior year. Current average commodity prices are approximately $109 per ton. For reference purposes, a $10 per ton change in commodity values equals approximately $0.03 of full year EPS, which includes the impact on our recycling facility and collection businesses.","Now I will discuss year-over-year margin. Second quarter 2013 adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.6% compared to 30.3% in the prior year, a decrease of 270 basis points. Most of the change relates to other SG&A expenses, which increased 140 basis points. We recorded $17 million of legal charges for various matters in the second quarter versus a $12 million reduction in expense in the prior year. The year-over-year variance in expense was approximately $29 million.","The remaining change in margin relates to disposal, labor and maintenance expenses, which increased 130 basis points combined. As Don mentioned, volume growth was concentrated in the roll-off line of business, which has the highest level of variable costs. These costs are impacted by changes in volume, since they are direct expenses of providing service to the customer.","Additionally, revenue mix impacted these costs as a percentage of revenue since collection volumes increased while post-collection volumes and commodity revenues both decreased.","The year-over-year impact of all other cost line items, which are listed in our 8-K filing, net to 0.","I will comment on some of the line items, which include, first, fuel.","The 30-basis-point improvement primarily relates to a higher percentage of natural gas trucks in our fleet. Currently, about 10% of our fleet runs on natural gas. We will continue to replace diesel trucks with natural gas trucks where appropriate and as part of our normal truck replacement cycle.","The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $3.88 in the second quarter of 2013 from $3.95 in the prior year, a decrease of approximately 2%. Current average diesel price is approximately $3.90 per gallon. For reference purposes, a $0.20 change in diesel fuel per gallon is about $0.01 of full year EPS, which includes the impact of our fuel recovery fees and fuel hedges.","Next, operating expenses. The 30-basis-point increase in expense primarily relates to favorable items in the prior year. Other operating expense as a percentage of revenue was 3.5% in the second quarter and was consistent with our expectations.","Finally, SG&A expenses. SG&A was 10.8% of revenue, an increase of 120 basis points compared to the prior year. As I previously mentioned, this is due to a year-over-year change in the amount of legal expenses. Excluding incremental legal charges in the current quarter, SG&A expense was 10% of revenue, which was consistent with our expectations.","DD&A as a percentage of revenue was 11.2% in the second quarter of 2013 versus 11.4% in the prior year. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles.","Ed will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data.","Edward A. Lang","Thanks, Glenn. Second quarter 2013 interest expense was $90 million, which included $12 million of noncash amortization. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $312 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted free cash flow included net capital expenditures of $469 million or 56% of our projected full year spend.","Cash flow can vary quarter to quarter, based on the timing of capital expenditures and working capital. As Don mentioned, we remain comfortable with our original full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $675 million to $700 million, even with higher-than-anticipated environmental expenditures. We now expect to receive cash tax refunds from prior years, which essentially offsets the higher spending for environmental remediation. We still expect to spend approximately $835 million for net capital expenditures in 2013.","Now I will discuss the balance sheet. At June 30, our accounts receivable balance was $877 million, and our days outstanding was 38 days or 25 days net of deferred revenue.","Reported debt was approximately $7 billion at June 30, and excess availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.5 billion.","I will now turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Ed. I'm proud of the Republic team and how we are executing our strategy. We are making smart investments in accretive acquisitions. We are appropriately developing our recycling infrastructure. We're systematically converting to automated and natural gas-fueled vehicles. We are maintaining our focus on multi-year initiatives designed to reduce costs and improve productivity. And we are growing units of service and reporting positive volume growth.","Our base business performance, highlighted by improving yield and volume growth, gives us confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flow. This enabled us to increase our dividend approximately 11% and continues our track record of efficiently and predictably returning cash to stockholders. We are focused on continually improving our business to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth. And finally, we remain committed to an efficient capital structure, maintaining our investment grade rating and increasing cash returns to our stockholders.","At this time, operator, I would like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on guidance. Historically, you guys have raised guidance in July. It seems like the fundamentals are turning and getting better versus when you originally guided. Is it fair to say that you guys are keeping guidance the same because of the higher litigation costs in SG&A that you guys didn't flag as sort of non-recurring?","Donald W. Slager","Well, Hamzah, this is Don. I would say, historically, we've updated guidance at this point in the year. And we are seeing some good signs in the business. We talked about the positive trends in volume and the sequential improvement in pricing. We also have -- the parts of the business that we're seeing growth in are in areas of construction. We're not necessarily seeing the kind of growth yet in service increases or growth in our commercial lines of business that give us more margin expansion. So at this time, we think our guidance is right on. And we'll take you through the year and we'll talk more about what we see after Q3.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's fair enough. And just a follow-up on volume. Could you maybe talk about seasonality and whether you saw above-normal seasonality? I realize there maybe some noise because of the weather. But maybe if you could address sort of underlying seasonality that you're seeing in your business.","Donald W. Slager","We saw what we would call normal seasonality this year. The only thing that we're -- we did see a little wet weather, which led to some disposal weights being a little bit higher. And, of course, we had a little bit of cleanup volume coming through from the tornado cleanup in Oklahoma City. But other than that, we would tell you that seasonality was normal for us this year.","Operator","The next question comes from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Don, I still don't understand. Maybe you can walk us through it or parcel it out, how EBITDA margin can be down 270 basis points year-over-year? And I see some of the cost of operation items that look a little, and pardon the expression, a little inflated on a comp basis, when you look at it year-over-year, meaning percentage of revenue, specifically like maintenance and labor and related benefits, but can you just help us through that?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, so let me give you my view of it. So you heard Glenn describe the legal charge, right? That was the biggest single piece of that change and that's -- let's call that a non-recurring item. We've had little more labor and maintenance than maybe we would have expected. And the big maintenance initiative is actually working very well. It's taken us a little bit longer to move through the system and get the traction we're hoping for, but we're still very positive on that. So it's something that we'll -- we think we'll overcome certainly in the next year. Part of the margin, frankly, still the fact that we're still not -- while price is sequentially improving, we're still not getting price in exceedance of normal inflation. So we like the fact that price is on the move upward, but we're going to have to do a little more pricing. We're going to have to get a little more help from the economy to get that going in the right direction. But we're on the right track and again, directionally, we're pretty pleased with it.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if I may try, the 270, I can probably attribute 140 of that to the legal charge. That's just $30 million for revenue.","Donald W. Slager","That's right. So what you have left, kind of split that between labor and maintenance, and then one other thing is disposal. So one of the things that's happening is that we're seeing an increase in our container weights and -- but we haven't seen that increase in container weights convert yet to service increases. So we probably described this to you before, but as in our commercial, small container business, as flat-rate customers begin to throw out more trash, they begin to fill the container up more and we end up hauling that extra trash for the same fixed revenue per month, and we don't get to charge for that until we get that extra service increase out of it. So our service increases right now are pretty flat. So one of the steps we would hope to see in this improving economy is just that, we'd like to see some service increases. The other thing is the growth that we're getting in the business is not coming in the parts of our business that has the benefit from density or the high-fixed cost, as I said in my comments. It's coming in the area of the roll-off business, which doesn't -- which has a high variable cost. And it's coming in some new contracts, new residential contracts but not contracts that lay over the top of our existing business. So as we see growth in our footprint, where we build more density, then we'll see that margin improve from that as well.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up, and I appreciate that color. It was helpful, Don. On the pricing side, absent the index-based business, can you shed some insight on market intelligence on pricing within competitive markets?","Donald W. Slager","Well, let me just say this. We still think the market is a rational market. We're out there every month with our price initiative, in and around what we used to call RPM, that ratable process we use, the 12 equal buckets as we've described before. Our pricing efforts continue, as far as things like customer defection or churn rates, things that we measure, those are very consistent with past periods. So we're not seeing any negative change there, but we're not maybe seeing enough positive change to reflect in even higher prices. But as I would -- but as I told you all along, we -- our belief is that as the economy improves, as volumes improve, that pricing environment is going to improve right along with it.","Operator","Next is from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Can you expound a little bit on the trends you're seeing at the landfill?","Donald W. Slager","Trends with volume?","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","With regard to volumes, yes.","Donald W. Slager","Well, first, we've had the first quarter of positive MSW volume growth at our landfills since I think 2008. Okay? So that's a pretty big deal. It's the first quarter. It's been an improving trend over the last 3 quarters, so -- but the first quarter we've gone positive. So C&D was a good month for us. A portion of that C&D volume came from, as I said, the Oklahoma tornado cleanups, but even that, we've seen a sequential improvement every quarter for the past 3 quarters in our C&D volumes. And I guess we're seeing that in our roll-off business as well. Pricing is reasonable at the landfill. We have not seen any real movement in landfill prices yet. We're hopeful that as volumes continue to increase, there's a little more opportunity to drive price through the disposal assets. One of the things that I'm sure you know, over these last several years, we've been very diligent with pricing correctly for these landfills. We've, over that time frame, frankly, lost a lot of MSW volume, what we call open market volume, to competitive landfills. But our hope would be that -- so we have very little of that business left today in the open market side of MSW in the landfill business. But we would hope that as, again, volumes return, improve, that there could be some pricing upside there for us in the latter half of this year, maybe certainly by next year.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, great. And then a bigger picture here, longer term, and where do you think that -- you've said that you now kind of turned the corner on volumes. Where do you think EBITDA margins can go as the volume cycle kind of plays out?","Donald W. Slager","All right. So it gets -- it's really kind of the same old story. Think about our business inflation, our cost inflation being somewhere, call it 2% to 2.5%. We may get 50 basis points a year out of productivity and initiatives around efficiency. And then we're left with 2% net inflation. We've got to get pricing exceeding inflation on a regular basis. We're going to need some help from CPI. We need to see CPI regulate in some sort of normal fashion and then that the open market pricing will follow. And in a normal environment when we see household formation occurring, business formation occurring on top of that, building more units into our density, we think we'll get back over 30%, but it's going to require that pricing exceeding inflation to do that and it's going to require an improving economy to help us give a push. So we're doing everything we can to appropriately price our business and grow the business intelligently, but we're going to need a little more help from the economy to get back there.","Operator","Joe Box with KeyBanc.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Don, I appreciate the comments earlier on price not outpacing inflation and some of the comments on fixed revenue customers. But it seems like things haven't really changed that much sequentially to where you'd actually see that much costs flow through operations. I'm just curious, can you give us a bit more color on some of the bigger cost of operations buckets, like labor and maintenance? Do you see them getting better leverage in the back half? Or is it possible that they continue to grow at a pace that exceeds sales growth?","Donald W. Slager","No, I don't think that. I mean again, as I said, also one of the comments I made is where we're getting some of the volume growth, it's not really happening -- again, when I talk about on top our density, we're not seeing the growth in our commercial, small container business within our route structure. We saw some of the growth come in through some large commercial contracts, basically franchise contracts that required new trucks and new routes, not new customers on top of our current route base. So that's going to come at a normal or -- at a normal margin not an expanded margin because of the density. Roll-off growth is really where we're seeing the bulk of our revenue, our volume growth, and again, that's a lower-margin business. So we've got to see that growth happen on a more broad-based way across all lines of business. And then we'll get that margin going back in the right direction. Maintenance has been a little bit of a headwind for us all year. Part of that is due to our One Fleet initiative. We'll anniversary that sometime next year and then it'll start to go positive for us. We've had a few little odds and ends kind of sneak up on us in costs, things like the cost related to the Green Fence initiative. So we're going to spend a couple million dollars a year more in cost -- or a couple of million dollars this quarter in cost to deal with that. So we're going to find a way to pass that back along in some kind of a price initiative with our customers, our recycling customers. So we're dealing with those things. I think, again, the base business is strong, evidenced by the fact that we're raising our dividend. We got a lot of confidence in the cash flow. And as we get the economy working back for us, even a little stronger than it has, we'll get the margin back to 30%. And if you net some of this stuff out, just kind of one-timer stuff, we're still 29% EBITDA margin, we think, by the end of the year.","Operator","The next comes from Corey Greendale with First Analysis.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I think -- not to beat the dead horse, but I think it's still breathing a little bit. So I understand all the comments about the mix affecting the margin. EBITDA dollars, though, are down year-over-year after adjusting for the legal charge. So I'm trying to figure out, since it sounds like MSW is growing and C&D at the landfills is growing and you had up -- I'm trying to figure out what's actually down. Is it special waste? So it was -- was there some relatively high-margin special waste last year that isn't there this year, and that's what's driving EBITDA dollars down?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, yes. Special waste is still not really a bright spot for us. We're down year-over-year in special waste volume. While we're up in C&D and MSW, the landfill special waste is down. So yes, a lot of this, Corey, is just mix. And I know that's an easy word to use to describe it, but there's a lot -- been a lot of small moving pieces in a big business and a lot of it just is mix. And EBITDA dollars are only down only slightly. So it's, as I'm just telling you, we have confidence in the guidance, confidence in the 29% adjusted EBITDA margin that we talked about and getting some of these one-timers behind us.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And I generally don't like asking company about another but the since there's this sort of this pronounced difference, on one of your competitors' calls earlier this week, there was a lot of talk about strength at the landfill and about how there's a lag between strength at the landfill and when they start to see that at the collection side. It sounds like it's going kind of in reverse for you. Can you talk about, conceptually, just given past cycles, what you expect, which of those 2 lags the other?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, I really can't comment on what's going on in the other company's business. I would tell you a couple of things. Their business mix, their geography is different than ours. Their percentage of third-party volume versus internal volume is going to be different than ours, so that's -- I really don't know enough about their business to comment. Our business doesn't move very quickly. It moves fairly slowly. So we wouldn't expect to see very large increases in volumes or prices over a one quarter or year-over-year basis. So for us, we still believe that, again, the business overall grows with household formation that turns into business formation. We think it starts in construction volumes coming back. We think it then becomes an issue with business formation and new units of service being added by new small businesses going, coming into our route base and adding that small container business. We think it's consumer spending increases and more trash is created in our small container business, we'll see service increases. And all that happening sort of within our dense footprint, which gives us some margin leverage. Again, we think as volume returns, pricing gets a little bit easier from there. So that's how we think the progression occurs. That's, frankly, how it's occurred for us historically. If their business model is that much different, then it may be different for them, but I really can't comment on that. And then, of course, as I've said in my earlier comments, we've been very persistent with landfill pricing in the open market over the last several years. We've, because of that, lost a fair amount of open market volume at our landfills, those are -- when I say open market, call it competitive volume from other waste haulers, who've chosen to take their waste to another landfill, that we have a very small portion of that now business made up of our landfill volume in total. And so we're not going to get the benefit of any volume growth that might come through competitive volume that way and maybe another competitor might. So somebody's got that volume, it's not -- it's no longer in our landfill. So all those mixes are different, Corey. So we don't spend a lot of time worrying about how they're going to grow the business as much as we worry about how we're going to grow ours.","Operator","Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","So just so -- I get it, all right. So I understand that the mix change and it's higher variable cost and that drives up labor disposal and your subcontractor. Help me understand what you're doing to get your hands around the 10% increase in maintenance, though. I'm still struggling with that a little. But I get the One Maintenance program, the One Fleet program, but 10% seems a lot.","Donald W. Slager","Well, there's a number of things there. One, the fleet is -- the fleet is changing. The fleet is changing through automation. The fleet is changing with CNG. Even clean diesel engines compared to the old trucks, before that, the clean diesel engines came on, all those trucks are really, frankly, a lot more costly to maintain. So we are seeing some maintenance increases, even where One Fleet initiative is not underway. The One Fleet initiative is driving up cost in the business, but we think it's going to anniversary and start to come down as we get through the second -- start to get into the second half of the fleet next year. So we are seeing benefits from One Fleet. The visions [ph] that've gone through One Fleet have experienced a 19% reduction in downtime, the ones that have gone through it at the beginning -- at the beginning waves. The fleet -- the local fleets that have gone through it recently haven't started to see any benefit yet. They're still spending money. The fleets that have gone through it sort of in the intermediate, the second or third wave, they're starting to see some benefit today. So this is just a matter of working through the fleet in its entirety, getting that culture built into our business, getting the durability in the fleet processes and then getting that benefit in reduction of downtime, reduction in unscheduled maintenance, better service standards, less -- fewer missed pickups, better driver morale, blah blah blah, and hopefully, even more opportunity to please the customer and have the customer even willing to pay us a little bit more for the service over time. So that's our hope and that's, frankly, our strong belief. And even though this thing has cost us a little bit more, we are more determined and more convinced it's the right thing to do than ever before. So we're going to see the benefits accrue in One Fleet and then maintenance, starting next year. And we're determined to make the fleet at Republic Services a world-class fleet in the process.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you made a comment about container weights, which I think is important, that on the commercial business, you're clearly seeing an uptick. Can you characterize that and as well as that positive MSW? What was the nature of the percent change because -- and then -- and in light of that, what's your feeling about the service integral upgrades, either the extra day or the bigger container? Where -- how far out is that, quarter 2?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, well, maybe it's a quarter 2. 2% is the increase in container weights. So we are very watchful now for that increase in service frequency. And we're talking to our drivers and front-line people to be on the lookout for that. And we know which customers, at some point, in the recent history went from 4 days a week to 3 days a week. And we're hopeful that, at some point we'll get them back to 4 days a week. That's when we can charge for the additional service. In the meantime, we charge for garbage on the ground or garbage over the top and those kinds of things and -- so a 2% container weight increase is a good thing. It's the first time we've actually seen this kind of a move in a long time. Up until now and every quarter, we get a question of something like this and we keep saying, \"Well, it's flat. It's bumping across the bottom. No change, no change.\" Well, we've got a change here that we're watching pretty closely now. We're excited about that turning into service increases and ultimately then again more revenue within our density. And that's where, again, we get the benefit. In the meantime, it costs you money. But you're not able to charge any more for those additional pounds in the container again until you have -- you get to add that service day. So it's something we'll talk with you more about next quarter as it develops. And hopefully, it's something that we see developing quarter-by-quarter after this, as this economy slowly crawls back.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the volume side, pretty good performance. It's almost up 1%. Even though I believe you had a couple of difficult comparisons with just some lost business that you still haven't lapped, have you...","Donald W. Slager","I think we've lagged it all -- or lapped it all, just about.","Edward A. Lang","Right. The large natural contract we lost anniversary-ed on May 1. And then the last of the disposal contracts anniversary-ed on June 30.","Donald W. Slager","All right, so I stand corrected.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, I was just wondering if you were to adjust for that, what sort of the true underlying run rate for volume because clearly it should be a little bit higher than 0.9%?","Edward A. Lang","Yes, Alex, it probably would've been 1% plus, as far as volumes. Maybe somewhere between 1% and 1.2%.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question, are you guys seeing the weather impacted volumes for you? I mean, in certain parts of the country, we certainly had some wet\/unseasonably colder weather for the spring. Do you think that had any impact on the business?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. We haven't talked about weather, other than we obviously had some rain that led to some increased disposal cost, also some disposal revenue at the same time. But maybe a little bit, but probably not enough to talk about on the call.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I got you. So it seems like a wash. And then just last question, any thoughts on how OCC prices trend through the balance of the year?","Edward A. Lang","Well, we if we look at OCC pricing right now, it's about -- well, our total commodities in all regions are $109 a ton. Seasonally, we probably just passed or we're in the process of passing kind of peak OCC pricing. This is when packaging or box manufacturers need to get product for the year-end holiday season. So it's -- what we do as, as far as planning for commodities, we assume it's going to be flat for the full year. When we gave our guidance back in February, we assumed commodities would be $112 a ton, all commodities, all regions. And we've kind of bumped around that number for most of the year. So I guess our expectation is built into the guidance or assuming flat commodities for the rest of the year.","Operator","Bill Fisher with Raymond James.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just quickly on the environmental accruals you've had, I guess in the last 3 quarters on the landfill side. And I think you mentioned you're spending some this year on it. Is a lot of that spending this year or next year, or how would you kind of think about that?","Glenn A. Culpepper","A good piece of it, Bill, is this year and next year as we put in a water treatment plant on-site. But overall, these are costs that will be incurred over the next 35 years.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So a lot of it is spread out. And then, Don, you mentioned special waste has been soft. Do you see any better bidding activity in the second half? Or how would you characterize that?","Donald W. Slager","Well, we're not -- we're only slightly into the second half so we're always hopeful, but it's been fairly competitive out there for special waste. So we'd like to think that as -- again, as economy improves, behavior improves with it, customer sentiment improves along with that and with people starting to get maybe a little more confidence in the economy and pricing power will persist. So we'll keep doing what we do and we'll watch closely to see what our competitors do in local markets and we'll see as the second half unfolds.","Operator","Next comes from Jeff Osborne with Stifel.","Jeffrey D. Osborne - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to understand in further detail the roll-off side and if you can kind of take a guesstimate on what the impact was to the EBITDA margins with the mix shift. I understand all the rationale but I think you've added correctly that that's kind of a low 20s EBITDA business and as that flow through, that was the impact there, relative to some of the other weaknesses on the higher profitability pieces?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, this is Don. You're probably right, it's sort of low 20 margin kind of a C&D business. Remember, again, this is sort of point-to-point service. We don't get that benefit of productivity gains and density gains in that business. And then looking -- and the rest of it is just a lot of mix. So again, we're very happy to have that volume. And we're hoping that volume turns into, again, a broader recovery in the other lines of business that will give us that margin expansion. As new business comes in on top of our normal business, call it, the small container part of our world, that's going to come in at a higher margin, and we start to see more landfill volume. We could see a blended sort of 40% margin on that blended business coming back.","Jeffrey D. Osborne - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Understand. And just the last point on the roll-off side, any comments on geographically where you're seeing the strength or what the cadence was through the quarter, factoring out the Oklahoma City issue?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, we really saw it everywhere. We saw C&D temp [ph] calls pick up across all 3 of our regions pretty consistently. So again, that's -- we would view that as good news as being a broader-based recovery in the quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.","Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So Q2 recycling volumes are up 4%. How much of this growth would you say is organic? So customers recycling more per stop than last year, that kind of thing, versus the product of capacity you might have added in the quarter and maybe even volumes you acquired in the quarter?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, most of that is driven from the new recycling facilities we brought online. So I would say it's -- and then we've seen this consistently, as we put in new facilities, we've driven more volume to recycling as a result of that.","Operator","Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Slager for his closing remarks.","Donald W. Slager","Thank you, Holly.

Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us. We're pleased with our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us well-positioned to achieve our full year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which allows us to attract and retain higher value customers, build the best team, increase profitability and create long-term value.","During the first quarter, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.48 and adjusted free cash flow of $160 million. Both were in line with our expectations. Core price was 3.4% and average yield was 2%. This was the fifth consecutive quarter with average yield of 2% or more. Average yield was strongest in our small container commercial and large container industrial businesses, where a majority of the business is in the open markets. In these open markets, we have great flexibility and can realize more pricing power from our enhanced product offering and improved service delivery and by leveraging our priority-based selling program and our Capture pricing tool.","First quarter volumes increased 2.5%. This included 50 basis points of contribution from one additional work day. Volume growth is concentrated to the event-driven waste streams, including construction and demolition in our collection and disposal businesses and landfill special waste. While a portion of this volume growth can be attributed to favorable weather conditions during the quarter, we saw broad-based volume growth across most of our markets. Additionally, Landfill MSW volumes grew 4.7%. This was the fifth straight quarter where MSW volume growth exceeded 3%.","First quarter EBITDA margin was 27.8%. It should be noted that the additional work day resulted in a 50 basis point margin headwind, which will not repeat in future quarters.","We returned $191 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This included 1.9 million shares repurchased for approximately $87 million.","Regarding our revenue enhancing and customer-facing initiatives, first, we now have approximately $325 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have consistently run higher than CPI.","Second, approximately 1.4 million customers are enrolled in My Resource, our customer portal and mobile app, which significantly enhances our customer interaction and connectivity.","Finally, we opened our first customer resource center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The center further enhances our customers\u2019 experience through a more professionally trained customer service team, improved technology and additional communication channels. We expect to open the other two customer resource centers later this year.","Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost-saving initiatives, 16% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 73% of our resi fleet is now currently automated and 81% of our total fleet has been certified under our OneFleet maintenance program, up from 64% a year ago. We are expediting the timeline to get our entire fleet through the program by June of this year and fully certified by mid-2017.","During the quarter, we completed a realignment of our organizational structure. This included the elimination of our regional teams, consolidation and reduction of our areas by 50%, and streamlining select positions at our Phoenix headquarters. We reinvested a portion of the cost savings back into the remaining area offices by creating additional operating and functional support roles, which puts resources closer to our business and our customers.","We were able to make these changes as a result of developing standardized processes, with rigorous controls and further leveraging our scale. At the same time, we maintained our high performance business culture with field management, retaining full accountability and P&L responsibility.","The savings from the realignment are funding the investments we are making in our customer-focused initiatives in 2016 and 2017. We expect these initiatives and the realignment will contribute approximately $35 million of annual cost savings beginning in 2018.","Before the turn the call over to Chuck, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our recycling business. As many of you know, recycled commodity values have always been somewhat volatile. However, the industry has never experienced such a sustained downturn in commodity pricing. We continue to evolve our recycling strategy to adapt to this new normal. ","We are focusing on three key areas to evolve our business model. First, as part of our realignment, we centralized management oversight and accountability for recycling processing operations. The new organizational structure ensures clear ownership for the recycling and processing market vertical, provides additional expertise and support to our recycling and collection operations. ","Second, we're transitioning to a fee-based recycling processing model. This model ensures we can cover our processing costs and earn an acceptable return on our processing investments.","Under this model, we are including provisions to incentivize communities to bring us high-quality materials. This includes the right to conduct waste stream audits and assess contamination fees and glass surcharges.","Finally, we\u2019re optimizing our recycling and collection business. Many municipal customers still believe there is significant value in the waste stream and are not aware of the cost to recover the material. Currently, our municipal sales team is focusing on educating municipal staff and elected officials on the all-in cost of recycling in these low commodity markets.","Although we're still in the early innings, we're making progress. We transitioned our largest municipal processing agreement to a fee-based structure, negotiated a rebate reduction with a large customer on the East Coast, and added a glass surcharge with a large customer in Texas. ","Our customers have told us they value recycling and are willing to pay for these services. Our collective actions to improve the performance of our recycling business is intended to create a model for Republic and our recycling customers that ensures profitability and, therefore, supports its long-term sustainability.","Chuck will now discuss our financial results.","Chuck Serianni","Thanks, Don.","First quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $79 million or 3.6% over the prior year. This 3.6% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.4% and acquisitions of 1.2%.","The components of internal growth are as follows. First, total average yield growth of 2%. Average yield in the collection business was 2.4%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small container commercial business, 2.3% yield in the large container industrial business, and 1% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes Landfill MSW of 1.5%. A majority of our third-party Landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts that contain pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.4%. Core price consisted of 4.5% in the open market and 1.7% in the restricted portion of our business.","Second, our total volumes increased 2.5% year-over-year. This includes 50 basis points of contribution from one additional work day. The following discussion of volume by line of business excludes the impact of the additional workday.","The collection business increased 1.4%, which includes increases from the large container business of 5.1% and the small container business of 20 basis points. As expected, the residential business declined 10 basis points.","With our large container business, temporary C&D volumes were up 13% and recurring volumes were up 2.9%. Our small container volume performance of 20 basis points includes a 40 basis point decline due to not renewing select national accounts customers and work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable.","The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 5.5%. Landfill volume increased 6.8%, which includes MSW of 4.7%, C&D of 17.8% and special waste of 8.7%. While C&D volumes and landfill volumes were broad-based geographically, we saw above-average volume growth in the areas of the country that experienced milder winter conditions.","At the same time, we saw heavier rainfall in certain areas of the country. In these areas, we experienced higher disposable expense due to heavier container weights and additional leachate management costs. We believe these additional costs were directly related to the wet weather and expect these costs will return to planned levels for the remainder of the year.","Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 140 basis points. The change relates to decline in the cost of fuel which decreased approximately $23 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.08 in the first quarter from $2.92 in the prior year, a decrease of 29%. The current average diesel price is $2.20 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.","Next, energy services revenue decreased 60 basis points. The decrease in energy services revenue primarily relates to a decrease in drilling activity resulting from a decline in oil prices. The energy services revenue decline includes a decrease in Tervita-related volumes from the date of acquisition and a decline in E&P volumes at our solid waste landfills.","Finally, commodity revenue decreased 10 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 10% to $100 per ton in the first quarter from $111 per ton in the prior year. First quarter total recycling volume of 621,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 7% from the prior year. Volumes were approximately 1% on a same-store basis. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was relatively flat with the prior year.","Now, I\u2019ll discuss changes in margin. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.8% which compares to 28.9% in the prior year. The change includes a 50 basis point decline from the additional workday, a 20 basis point decline from net fuel and a decline of 40 basis points from an increase in healthcare-related expenses.","Regarding the increase in healthcare costs, we self-insure employee medical claims. In the first quarter, we saw an increase in large claims, primarily resulting from non-work-related injuries and one-time incidents. We did not make any changes in our plan structure and our third-party administrator confirmed these were not inflationary type increases. We expect healthcare costs return back to planned levels for the remainder of the year.","When looking at other cost line items as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees and the sale of commodity revenue. For example, the 1.5% decline in these revenues resulted in an increase in labor expense as a percentage of revenue of 30 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 20 basis points. SG&A costs were 10.7% of revenue and in line with our expectations. These costs improved 30 basis points compared to the prior year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.","First quarter 2016 interest expense was $93 million, which includes $12 million of non-cash amortization. Our effective tax rate was approximately 38%. The lower tax rate in the first quarter reflects a $0.01 EPS benefit from settling estate tax matter. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year.","First quarter adjusted free cash flow was $160 million and in line with our expectations. During the quarter, we spent $275 million or approximately 31% of our annual projected capital expenditures.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Don.","Don Slager ","Thanks, Chuck. To conclude, our first quarter results were consistent with our expectations and keep us on track to achieve our full-year guidance. I\u2019m proud of how the Republic team continued to execute our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation and our performance reflects our hard work.","We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders, including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders.","At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Please go-ahead.","Andrew Buscaglia","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter.","Don Slager","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Buscaglia","Can you just talk a little bit about your volume? So we\u2019re seeing strength across, not just with you, but with your peers, can you just talk about if this surprised you in the quarter? I know there\u2019s a lot going on with milder weather and extra workday. But does this surprise you and is this inflection we\u2019re seeing with strength sustainable in your opinion?","Don Slager","Yes. So I don\u2019t think the extra workday surprised us. The weather was certainly \u2013 if you compare the weather in Q1 to Q1 last year, the weather was much milder, which we like. The standard answer we tend to give in Q1 on this kind of thing is that a big, important quarter for us is Q2, Andrew, as we see the normal seasonality return. So we\u2019re very happy with the trends. We know there\u2019s a lot of good construction activity going on out there that\u2019s driving our volume growth. As I said in my comments, a lot of this is kind of the event business. Construction, special waste doing well. So we\u2019d like to think it will continue into Q2. Again, the weather comp would be a different than Q2 over last year. But there is no doubt that it\u2019s fairly robust out there.","Andrew Buscaglia","I missed what you said before with your guidance for volume. I know you had said 0.5% to 1% last quarter. But I guess we\u2019re just waiting here on Q2 to see if it is sustainable before you guys feel comfortable.","Don Slager","Look, we would say that our volume guidance \u2013 we probably feel like it\u2019s going to be closer to the high end of that range based on how strong Q1 was. So that\u2019s the math we are trying to do. We would agree with it. Keep in mind, we gave that guidance because we\u2019ve got a little bit of loss business coming up in some of the residential contracts that we expect to lose because we couldn\u2019t negotiate reasonable rates to extend the business. So we know that\u2019s coming later in the year that will offset a little bit, but we\u2019ll see probably volume at the higher end of the range. ","Chuck Serianni","So, Andrew, you can expect to see residential volumes approximately negative 1% because of the losses that Don had talked about for the full year and that\u2019s what brings us closer to the 1% total volume growth.","Andrew Buscaglia","Got it. All right, thank guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from Hansa Mazzarri of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi. This is [indiscernible]. I\u2019m filling in for Hansa. Thanks for taking the question. You guys mentioned in the past about converting the CPI index contracts into an alternative index that better suits your costs. Can you just give us some color on whether this conversion process is going slower or faster than you guys anticipated? Is it getting easier as you convert more?","Don Slager","So I said in my comments, we\u2019re up to $325 million now. That\u2019s quite a bit more than 10% of our total. I think we\u2019re picking up a little bit of speed. I would say it\u2019s \u2013 I think, let\u2019s say, it\u2019s getting easier because our people are getting more confident in their ability to have the conversation with customers. As I probably said you before, it\u2019s all about fairness, coming up with an escalator that both the customer and the provider can live with that\u2019s fair based on reasonable inflationary costs. So we\u2019re making headway. We\u2019ll continue to do so. I think the market is becoming more \u2013 I would say more adjusted to it. And so, we\u2019ll see how it goes through time. But we\u2019re fairly positive.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And just one follow-up question. Customer churn, how is that trending versus a year ago in terms of the competitive environment? What\u2019s going on with that?","Don Slager","Yeah. So defection, if we\u2019re talking about defection, that\u2019s pretty flat compared to last year. And customer churn, overall, is flattish, but I would say, on a longer trajectory, we continue to see the benefits of our pricing tools, Capture, et cetera, to help us to do a better job with churn.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, guys. Appreciate it. Thanks for taking questions.","Don Slager","Thanks.","Chuck Serianni","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tyler Brown","Hey, good afternoon, guys. ","Don Slager","Hi, Tyler.","Tyler Brown","Just wanted to go through a couple of cost items. So first off, we saw maintenance and repairs were up 10%. I get it that we have some acquisitions, you had the extra day. But 10% seems kind of heady here particularly when revs were up maybe 4% and 81% of the fleet is under the new initiative. Can you talk a little bit about when you would expect to see that unit cost inflation and maintenance and repair to start going the other way?","Chuck Serianni","Sure. So we expect right now that cost as a percentage of revenues for maintenance will decline sequentially for the remainder of the year. We also expect that exiting 2016 that that cost will be lower than what we experienced in 2015. So I would say that the trajectory is going in the right direction here.","Tyler Brown","You\u2019re expecting the actual physical cost to be down in 2017, is that what you\u2019re saying?","Chuck Serianni","The cost as a percentage of revenue.","Tyler Brown","Okay, okay.","Chuck Serianni","And when you\u2019re looking at the costs year-over-year on a dollar basis, Tyler, keep in mind that about half of that increase almost is due to volume and acquisitions. You\u2019ve got some timing issues in there also with some heavy equipment. And then, as Don had mentioned, we\u2019re making a push right now to get this OneFleet maintenance initiative all the way through the organization. So that\u2019s what\u2019s causing this to be a little bit higher on a dollar basis year-over-year.","Tyler Brown","Okay. So it sounds like it pays off more kind of as a percentage of revenue in 2017. And then, Chuck, real quick, can you go back over the healthcare expense? So how much was it in gross dollars? And just to be clear, you\u2019re not expecting that to recur?","Chuck Serianni","So we\u2019re not expecting it to recur. It\u2019s about $9 million in terms of dollars on a year-over-year basis. When we look at the portfolio claims that we got during the first quarter, it had to do with, what we would say, very unusual items. So think about complications associated with implants. Think about gastrointestinal infections. These aren\u2019t types of claims that we typically get. Most of our claims are musculoskeletal. This is totally unusual for us. And we talked to our experts about this, and they said, yes, it\u2019s very unusual for you. It\u2019s very unusual for companies in the transportation industry. But in their experience, on the portfolio of businesses that they look at, every once in a while, you have one of these Black Swan events. We continue to monitor the expenses in April and they are actually coming down to normalized levels. And so, that gives us more confidence saying that this was a one-time blip in these claims.","Don Slager","Yeah, Tyler, you can tell by Chuck\u2019s detailed answer that we spent a lot of time digging into this claim data. So we think that Q1 is somewhat of an anomaly here.","Tyler Brown","Okay. No, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s two. I\u2019ll call hop back in queue. ","Don Slager","All right.","Operator","And the next question will come from Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Please go ahead.","Corey Greendale","Hey, good afternoon.","Don Slager","Hi, Corey.","Chuck Serianni","Hi, Corey.","Corey Greendale","Maybe for Chuck or whoever wants to take this, the free cash flow in the quarter, it\u2019s softer relative to what we\u2019ve seen in the past few years for Q1 seasonality. Can you just address that? It looks like some working capital things are moving around. But is it in line with what you expected and should we expect the seasonality to be different this year?","Chuck Serianni","Yes. So absolutely in line with what we had expected. When you look at it quarter-over-quarter, you\u2019ve got about $70 million more CapEx during 2016 than we had in 2015. That\u2019s associated with truck purchases that we made, having to do with some contracts in Northern California. And then we had some working capital items also. So the timing of payroll, we actually had an extra payroll during the quarter. Also, higher incentive compensation that was paid during the quarter versus last year. So all timing related. And still feel very comfortable with our annual guidance of $820 million to $840 million.","Don Slager","And, Corey, one of the ways you may want to think of it too is, if you take a look at $160 million that we reported in the first quarter, if you normalize the CapEx, so had we only purchased 25% of full year guidance, that would have added $50 million to our performance, which would\u2019ve put us around $210 million. You can do the math on that and see what that extrapolates to the year.","Corey Greendale","Okay. And then maybe my second question, also on the cost side, did I understand \u2013 Chuck, did you say that fuel was a net negative to margin? Can you just repeat that? And then, is the full benefit of taking out the layer of management, was that in Q1? Or should we expect some more cost reduction in Q2 versus Q1?","Chuck Serianni","Okay. So in terms of the impact of the net fuel on margins, it was about 20 basis points of negative. So keep in mind that what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re pulling that revenue off, and so it\u2019s having an adverse impact on the margins overall. So that was about 20 basis points.","In terms of the initiatives, during the quarter, we had about $3 million in savings. We expect that to go up, maybe closer to $5 million to $6 million in savings on a quarterly basis. But also keep in mind that what we had guided to was the fact that we would have some initiative investments during the year that would offset that. So I would say that, right now, we\u2019re right on track in terms of our initiative savings or realignment savings.","Corey Greendale","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from Joe Box of KeyBank Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joe Box","Hi, guys.","Don Slager","Hi, Joe.","Chuck Serianni","Hi, Joe.","Joe Box","So I just want to dig into the margin a little bit further. Your EBITDA margins are down 110 basis points. And if you add back the extra day, which is 50 basis points, it sounds like 40 or so basis points from healthcare problems, call it about a 20 basis point headwind. I\u2019m just curious, if you were to normalize some of those other elevated expenses, whether it\u2019s leachate or disposal costs, where do you think that EBITDA margin would\u2019ve shaken out, Don?","Don Slager","Let\u2019s think about it this way, Joe. You look at the EBITDA margin that we reported, 27.8%, add back, to your point, 40 basis points for the health expense. And then keep in mind that, during Q1, you had your seasonally highest SG&A. So we\u2019re 10.7% versus our guidance of about 10.5% for the year. It\u2019s another 20 basis points. So a total of 60 basis points. Add that back to the 27.8% and you get 28.4%, which is right in line with our guidance for the year.","Joe Box","Okay. Maybe switching gears to the recycling side, can you maybe talk to how long it might take to adapt this fee-based recycling model and maybe at what current recycling prices are \u2013 how out of whack do you think the revenues are relative to your processing costs? I\u2019m just trying to understand what the overall benefit could be as this gets absorbed into the system.","Don Slager","Well, starting out, let\u2019s back up to recent year highs. In recycling, today, we are down over like $120 million\u2026","Chuck Serianni","$70 a ton.","Don Slager","Yeah, right. So that\u2019s what we were enjoying, whatever it was, seven, eight years ago. So we realigned the organization, so we said it will be focused on getting better profitability cost structure on the processing side. Those folks are doing a great job at that. We need to migrate that over to the collection side now and into some of the hauling contracts. It\u2019s going to take a little while. We probably have some routes out there that are dense enough that may never have enough participation or density to make sense, so we\u2019re going to be addressing that in the open market certainly and maybe even some other contractual stuff.","We\u2019ve got to make more headway with our municipal partners. And as I said in my comments, we\u2019ve got some examples where we\u2019re negotiating glass surcharges. We\u2019re taking glass out. We are changing the rebate structure, the fee-based etc. So we\u2019re getting better at it, but we are very, very early innings.","I think we are much farther along in moving the municipal contracts to the new index. We\u2019ve got more momentum there. We\u2019re breathing some fire now into the recycling collection business to move those contracts. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take, Joe. It\u2019s going to depend a little bit on \u2013 what the market dynamic is. But we\u2019re not going to be caught with getting drunk again on high commodity prices. We\u2019ve got to fix the business for good, get to the right sharing with our customer base. As I always say, and as I said in my comments, sustainability doesn\u2019t work without profitability. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. And we are not going to do business that has diminishing returns.","Joe Box","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go-ahead","Michael Hoffman","Thank you, Don, for taking my questions. ","Don Slager","Hi, Michael. How are you?","Michael Hoffman","I\u2019m well. Thank you. And yourself?","Don Slager","Very good, thanks.","Michael Hoffman","So back to the CPI, at one point over the last couple of years, you had described the pull of addressable revenues at about $2 billion. What do you think is a practical number that can be converted on a percentage basis? And where I\u2019m going with that is, it would be a good thing if you got some number and then inflation comes back to 2%. And when the two blend together, you\u2019re net ahead of the game.","Don Slager","So, again, with everybody listening \u2013 hopefully, a lot of my teammates at Republic \u2013 we absolutely, positively can\u2019t be entering into contracts with escalators that don\u2019t keep pace with our net inflation, inflation net of productivity. We\u2019ve got to be equal or better. And as I\u2019ve said many times, for decades, as long as I\u2019ve been around, that CPI worked great, it was fair. We need to get to fairness again.","And so, my viewpoint is all contracts have to be converted to a metric or an escalator that\u2019s fair and reasonable. And so, we\u2019re tackling this base. We said, look, we\u2019ve got $2.5 billion of this business. About $800 million of that $2.5 billion is the smaller contracts. That\u2019s what we went to work first. Now, we\u2019ve got $325 million of that converted. Now, we\u2019re working toward bigger contracts. We\u2019re, right now, as we speak, talking to customers, some very large customers, about this very thing. And I think at some point we\u2019ll have made some of those conversions successful and the market will continue to move.","So if you take a look at our pricing, this quarter, at 2% yield, we\u2019ve been north of 2% now for a few quarters. What keeps holding that back down is residential. And so, we\u2019re very, very close to hitting this overarching metric for us of getting back to a day where yield surpasses inflation on a regular and consistent basis. So we are right on the cusp of that. And so, we\u2019re going to keep pushing the new metric. I don\u2019t have an exact date in mind when we can get there. I know we\u2019re making progress, Michael. You can tell by the determination of my voice that we\u2019re kind of at a place we\u2019re not taking no for an answer because we just can\u2019t be in a situation where we have these large contracts with all the exposure and declining returns. It\u2019s just not feasible or it\u2019s not practical.","Michael Hoffman","All right, fair enough. Switching gears to margin trend, if I took your 50 basis points for adjustment to your gross margin, so instead of doing 38.60%, you did 39.1% for the first quarter. Given how good the volume was and possibly some of it got pulled forward, is it probable that the gross margin in 2Q might trend down a little bit, 20, 25 basis points? And really, what you want to look at is smoothing the first half and comparing that to the first half\u2019s 15 basis points?","Don Slager","No, I don\u2019t think so, Michael. I think that \u2013 I don\u2019t know that we necessarily need to smooth it. Part of the noise that I think that we might be seeing in the first quarter has to do with the workday. And we need to keep in mind that that reverses in Q4, so there\u2019s going to be a little pick up there when that happens. But I would say that, right now, we feel pretty comfortable with our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance that we gave of 28.5% for the year.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. I wasn\u2019t disputing that. I was really actually trying to figure out, given how strong volumes were in the first quarter and operating leverage that comes from that, in all likelihood, those volumes remain good, but not as good as 1Q because of the positive circumstances and that, therefore, you might see a slight shift in margin, 1Q to the next. It\u2019s not a bad thing. If you smooth the two Qs together, you\u2019ve got the objective you\u2019re trying to achieve anyway. But you pulled some of that benefit into 1Q.","Brian DelGhiaccio","This is Brian. So, remember, the largest percentage of our volume growth was in the roll-off business, which was up about 13%. And as you know, that comes along with it the variable costs. I know you\u2019re talking about leverage, but that\u2019s where we saw the concentration of volume.","But the other thing is that we know that, while it was a mild winter, in parts of the country it was also wet. So we did see extra operating costs. We saw higher disposal expense where we\u2019ve got predominantly third-party disposal market. And we saw some additional leachate expense, again, where it was wet. So from a weather perspective, it\u2019s not that we feel like we got a whole lot of contribution to the bottom line from the mild winter. So if the revenues fall off a little bit in the second quarter because maybe they were pulled forward, we would also expect some of the cost to taper off as well. ","Michael Hoffman","Okay, fair enough.","Chuck Serianni","Too often \u2013 sometimes the answer is timing and mix, Michael, right? That\u2019s kind of what Brian said. But you\u2019re right, [indiscernible] quarter was very strong. If you take out some of the anomalies, call it just healthcare, some of the leachate expense, some of that stuff, I look at like we had a [indiscernible] quarter. We\u2019ve got a little bit of noise with a few items. And we\u2019ve got a little bit of \u2013 as Chuck described with the residential volume, we\u2019ve got couple of blips on the horizon there with some contracts we\u2019ll walk away from. We talked in the comments about some volume where non-regrettable volume loss with national accounts and brokers. So there is some of that noise in the system, but we\u2019re really confident in the guidance and in the margin. And more importantly, in the actions we\u2019re taking and in the way the team is executing.","Don Slager","And, Michael, maybe to your question, as Chuck kind of mentioned, second half probably looks better than first half because in the second half we have one less work day whereas in the first half we had the one more. So maybe that\u2019s the way you want to think about it. ","Michael Hoffman","Okay, fair enough. See you guys in a couple of weeks.","Chuck Serianni","All right, take care. ","Operator","The next question will come from Jeff Volshteyn of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeff Volshteyn","Thank you for taking my question. I might have missed it, but did you give any update in your prepared remarks about 2016 guidance other than what you said in the Q&A for volume and CapEx?","Don Slager","No, we didn\u2019t update our guidance. That\u2019s something that we typically save for the second quarter. And right now, what we said is that we feel comfortable and we\u2019re on track with our guidance.","Jeff Volshteyn","Okay, fair enough. On acquisitions, in the first quarter, we didn\u2019t see any acquisitions. How is the M&A environment for small tuck-ins?","Chuck Serianni","We set out the year with a target of spending $100 million and spending that $100 million primarily in tuck-ins and primarily within the same EBITDA range that we had over the last couple of years. And we still today think that we\u2019ll accomplish that goal. We\u2019ve got a real slow start here on the year. But we think we will exit the year having very wisely spent $100 million and invested it in some really good tuck-in assets.","Jeff Volshteyn","That\u2019s helpful. Last question from me, if I may. You mentioned higher leachate costs, one of your competitors also talked about it today in their call. Are there any sizable investments that you expect related to this issue?","Don Slager","No, not really. Not for us. We look at leachate as being somewhat unique to the individual landfill. It really is about the geology of the individual landfills and also the weather that exists, whether it\u2019s a dry climate or wet. Obviously, in the Southwest, we don\u2019t have a lot of leachate. We don\u2019t have a lot of rain. We\u2019ve got arid climate, so the water evaporates. We\u2019ve got some landfills that have in-gradient water flows that we\u2019ve got to deal with. So that\u2019s a little bit of a different issue. So really site-specific. The leachate cost that we saw in Q1 was really more about a seasonally wet \u2013 an unusually seasonally wet quarter. Having said that, landfills are more expensive to own and operate every day and every year and we\u2019re constantly evaluating our cost structure and constantly looking for ways to effectively pass along price increases into the market that makes sense, to capture the cost inflation. We\u2019ve got to manage these things responsibly and be good environmental stewards and we\u2019ll continue to do that. For us, leachate is really more of a site-specific issue. But that\u2019s all I can tell you. As we look at the quarter, there\u2019s nothing else for us really going on broadly with our leachate story.","Jeff Volshteyn","Okay, thank you very much. ","Operator","And the next question will come from Michael Feniger of Bank of America.","Michael Feniger","Thanks. Did you guys see any changes through the quarter in April? You were speaking about special event volume, C&D, anything that makes you \u2013 any cause for concern that the momentum you felt on the volume side would slow going into the second quarter?","Don Slager","Well, no. I think specific construction volume is strong \u2013 one, because of the unusual weather. But Q2 is where we tend to see the seasonal pickups and we certainly expect to see that. Event business \u2013 the special waste business was strong in Q1. There\u2019s no concern that we have there overall. We\u2019re still only at, what, 1.1 million new home starts. Single-family home starts are actually up, right, on a year-over-year basis. So that bodes well for us. We tend to lag that. So as long as that continues, I think that\u2019s what drives more and more growth in our market. On a total macro basis, we\u2019re feeling really good. ","Michael Feniger","Thanks. And the loss of the residential businesses that you guys were discussing, should we be thinking that as a positive? Or for the mix, would that be positive to margin? ","Don Slager","Yeah. Ultimately, look, residential is our weakest line of business in our collection system. And you think about the state of affairs there that we\u2019ve had the sustained low CPI environment there for how many years?","Chuck Serianni","Six, seven years.","Don Slager","Six, seven years. Its average over that time is 1.6%. Our costs don\u2019t average 1.6%. So you can just do some math and figure out what kind of margin erosion we had there in that space. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so adamant about changing the indices to something that\u2019s fair and reasonable. So we get to do a negotiation with the residential customer who can\u2019t seem to understand that degree of fairness, we can\u2019t enter into extending contracts that continue to decline and go below our reasonable rate of return. So ultimately we have to grow the ROI in the business. And so, your point is, over time, that\u2019s a good thing. We either have to shed business that doesn\u2019t equal the right return or we have to get a pricing scenario that is reasonable for both parties. And that\u2019s the story. It\u2019s the same story with national accounts and some of the broker business.","Operator","Our next question will come from of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital. Please go-ahead.","Q \u2013Megan Barnett","This is Megan on for Scott. So I just want to go back to talk about the volume, any regional outliers, positive or negative, impact on volume?","Don Slager","Well, if you think about places that have really mild weather, the Atlantic area, Philadelphia, Carolinas, Chicago and Boston, places like that that just had very mild, mild winter, I would point those out specifically. We didn\u2019t see much difference here in Arizona quite frankly. But that gives you some idea. ","Q \u2013Megan Barnett","Okay, thanks. And then another question to discuss trends in your energy waste business and like how it impacted your margins?","Chuck Serianni","Generally speaking, the business is performing somewhat like we thought it would. We knew it would be weaker because this year than maybe we thought when we started the business. But we budgeted essentially for that. Probably a little bit weaker overall, but I think the thing that we always want to point out is we think ultimately through the cycle that that business is going to come back and perform well for the company.","Don Slager","Keep in mind also that it is less than 1% of our revenues, so the impact on the entire company is pretty small.","Chuck Serianni","So, Megan, the overall impact to the total company was about 20 basis points negative to margin.","Q \u2013Megan Barnett","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","And the next question will come from Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities. Please go-ahead.","Al Kaschalk","Hey, good afternoon, guys. ","A - Don Slager","Hi, Al.","Al Kaschalk","Sorry, I joined late. I wanted to focus on really I guess two areas. One, you talked a little bit about the leachate and maybe you could just take a step back and help us appreciate, is this more focused or more of a concern to companies that have higher number of closed landfills than, say, maybe whether storms or other things could occur and therefore water could increase. Could you just talk a little bit about that? Then I have a follow-up.","Don Slager","Well, as I said in my comments earlier, leachate is really two things. We talk about it being site-specific. It\u2019s really about geology and weather. If you have a large landfill with a big open face that\u2019s not covered, then you get a lot of rainfall. All that rainfall goes into your landfill and becomes leachate. Okay? If you are in an arid clime where we don\u2019t have leachate or don\u2019t have rainfall you don\u2019t have a problem. ","So it\u2019s very site-specific. And again, we have a lot of rainfall in certain parts of the country. In certain parts here, we have snow normally. Snow tends to fall and sit on top of the landfill and then evaporate before it melts. Rainfall tends to get inside your landfill. I\u2019m not a weatherman, but that\u2019s kind of how it works out. So we have a number of closed landfills certainly. Some of those are so closed that they\u2019re inert and there\u2019s virtually no leachate coming out of them. So once you completely cap the landfill and it\u2019s in a completely closed state, there\u2019s no more rain water getting in the landfill. So it\u2019s just about timing I guess when it comes to that point. For us, we don\u2019t have from our perspective \u2013 as I said on an earlier question \u2013 a broad-based concern about leachate today. We have some specific sites that saw more leachate in the quarter because of rainfall and we are dealing with that through normal operating expense.","Chuck Serianni","And just to put a finer point on that, with the areas \u2013 the landfills that we saw that had an increase in leachate, they were active landfills in the areas that had very, very heavy rains during the quarter.","Al Kaschalk","So I guess from the novice point being from my side, the item we want to focus on or center our questions on are those landfills that are closed where you\u2019re not able to potentially charge someone for those extra costs you incur versus an active one you theoretically have the ability to pass through some costs. Whether you get that is a whole different story. Is that fair?","Don Slager","Yeah. I\u2019m not sure I totally understand your question. I can\u2019t tell you off the top of my head the exact percentage of our leachate that comes from closed landfills and open landfills, but the majority of our leachate comes from open operating landfills. As I said, the longer the landfill is capped and closed, the less leachate is present in the landfill.","Chuck Serianni","And keep in mind also, when we cap our landfills, there is a synthetic liner that is put on top of it that prevents the leachate from going into the landfill \u2013 the rainfall. ","Don Slager","Our leachate expense was normal across the company with the exception of those sites that saw a much higher level of rainfall than normal. Or potentially a landfill that was in the midst of construction and rainfall event while part of the landfill was open where normally it wouldn\u2019t be. But other than that, our leachate expense across the company net of those landfills is just inflating at what would be normal inflation rate. ","Al Kaschalk","Got it. Okay, I think I\u2019ll leave that one.","Don Slager","And so, we generally \u2013 to your pricing question, we generally deal with leachate expense and the cost of leachate expense through our environmental recovery fee with our landfill customers. And so, over time, we have raised our environment recovery fee to deal with certain issues like leachate expense and we\u2019ve done that very effectively over recent years and customers seem to understand that. So that\u2019s been our mechanism to deal with it.","Al Kaschalk","Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up would be, if you could give us some type of \u2013 I won\u2019t say I\u2019m a macroeconomist et cetera, but generally I think at the peak you had at C&D volumes on landfill, I thought, were 17%, 18% of your revenue. You commented where housing starts are, et cetera. And you\u2019ve always had a better leverage to \u2013 or higher leverage, in my understanding, than you competitors to sort of that non-residential construction activity. So, A, could you maybe just frame where we\u2019re at in terms of percentage of revenue? And then, sort of, how much tailwind do we have on these positive volume numbers that we saw?","Chuck Serianni","We don\u2019t really give a lot of data on non-res versus res construction because\u2026","Al Kaschalk","That\u2019s a fact.","Chuck Serianni","Because again, to us, it\u2019s not that important. And we\u2019re not economists either. Our total C&D for the company is about 8%. And at its peak, it was 12%. Okay? At its peak. So we think about \u2013 I always think about it this way. Again, back to housing starts, we\u2019ve said for many moons now, our business grows with population growth that drives household formation, that drives business formation. And while the household formation creates \u2013 business formation does create some construction debris, what we really like to see is it creates the ongoing recurring revenue part of our business which is the small container, large container pickups and pulls that are ongoing. That\u2019s the part of our business that\u2019s kind of our bread and butter. And we know that the construction is going to ebb and flow a little bit with the economy. Having said that, housing starts are 1.1 million. The 50 year average, if we take the peak out, is a 1.5 million. Most people I talk to that are in the housing business are pretty bullish on housing continuing to improve. I mentioned that single family housing is \u2013 home starts is up like 20%. And you know we lag sort of a year plus when that\u2019s happening. So we think [indiscernible] strong temp volume, 13% in that space. So we\u2019ll continue to do that. So we feel overall pretty positive about the macro. ","Al Kaschalk","Great. Good luck, guys. And thanks a lot for taking my questions. ","Operator","At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.","Don Slager","Thank you, Denise.

Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our strong second quarter results. The team sustained the momentum built in the first quarter by executing our business plan, advancing our multiyear initiatives and capitalizing on strong solid waste trends. As a result, we continued to grow both price and volume, effectively managed our costs, and despite a $0.10 headwind from recycling delivered double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow.","Additional second quarter highlights include adjusted EPS of $0.73, an increase of 20%; adjusted free cash flow of $323 million, an increase of 173%. Core price was 3.6% and average yield was 2.1%, both in line with our expectations. Average yield was strongest in our small container and large container businesses. The majority of these customers are in open markets where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform.","We have converted almost 25% or $590 million of our CPI-based contracts to a waste-related index or a fixed-rate increase of 3% or greater for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have historically run higher than CPI. Volumes during the quarter increased 60 basis points.","Excluding the impact of non-regrettable losses and a difficult special waste comparison in the prior year, volume growth would have been 1.4%. The solid waste business contributed 50 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. We maintained customer defection of less than 7% for the second quarter in a row. We invested $56 million in tuck-in acquisitions in the second quarter, plus an additional $42 million in July. This brings our year-to-date investment to $123 million.","In February, we guided to over $150 million of investment for the full year. Our pipeline continues to be robust and we now expect investment \u2013 to invest approximately $200 million in tuck-in acquisitions for the full year. And finally, we continued our practice of increasing cash returns to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $328 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Additionally, our board approved a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend. This is consistent with our historical practice of raising the dividend in the mid- to high-single-digit range. The annualized dividend is now $1.50 per share.","Next, I'd like to make a few comments on recycling. At this time, China's actions continue to create a supply-demand imbalance for recovered paper. This unprecedented imbalance is causing commodity prices to remain low and processing costs to increase as mills become more selective in the quality of material they buy.","While this situation is painful in the near term, we believe these market conditions will serve as the catalyst needed to transform recycling into a durable, sustainable business model, a model in which companies can continue to invest for the benefit of their communities without undue risk.","The Republic team is taking action. We are working diligently to both minimize the near-term impact of these headwinds and accelerate efforts to shift our municipal customers to a fee-based pricing model with a more equitable risk-sharing arrangement. First, in the open market, we are raising prices to cover higher processing costs resulting from stricter contamination requirements.","Second, in the restricted market, our sales team is meeting face to face with our 1,000-plus municipal recycling customers. We are requesting an immediate price increase and adoption of a new pricing structure at or before contract renewal. This structure includes a fee to collect the material, plus a net processing fee that factors in processing cost, contamination levels and commodity prices. Of the customers we've met with to-date, 10% have already agreed to an incremental price increase within the next six months. And another 60% are reviewing and approving price adjustments or considering implementing the new pricing structure by the next contract cycle.","Typically, negotiations with staff and city council approvals take months to obtain. So, we're extremely pleased with the initial results of these concentrated efforts over the past 90 days.","Third, to support our initiatives to increase prices and transition to a new pricing structure, we are leveraging the current environment to drive awareness and change among our customers and consumers. For example, we are hosting webcasts, presenting to state and local officials and conducting interviews with local and national media. Additionally, we are meeting with municipal solid waste directors and consultants to review the new pricing model and explain why it must be included in future RFPs.","And finally, we are leveraging technology to increase productivity, reduce cost and improve the quality of material recovered at our processing centers. Our customers have told us repeatedly that recycling is important to them, and they are demonstrating their willingness to pay. Although it will take time, with their help, we can ensure recycling is sustainable for generations to come.","Next, turning to our full-year guidance. Despite a recycling headwind of approximately $0.30 versus the prior year, we are reiterating our full-year EPS and free cash flow guidance. Growth in the solid waste business is more than offsetting the headwind from recycling. In fact, even if you remove the benefit from tax reform, we still expect to see mid- to high-single-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow, despite the recycling headwind. Looking forward, the immediate actions we are taking in the recycling business will not only benefit the remainder of 2018, but will also generate positive momentum heading into next year.","Furthermore, the current macro indicators that impact our business continue to remain favorable. We believe this will lead to an increasingly supportive pricing environment and continued volume growth in the future.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Chuck, who's going to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Chuck?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Don. Second quarter revenue was approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $94 million or 3.9% over the prior year. The increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.1% and acquisitions of 1.8%. The components of internal growth are as follows: First, average yield increased 2.1% and was in line with our expectations. Average yields in the collection business was 2.4%, which includes 2.6% in the small container business, 2.5% in the large container business and 2% in the residential business.","Average yield in the post collection business was 1.5%, which includes landfill MSW of 2%. The majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.6%. Core price consisted of 4.4% in the open market and 2.3% in the restricted portion of our business.","The second component of internal growth is total volume, which increased 60 basis points over the prior year. Volumes in our large container business increased 2.5% and volumes in the small container business were essentially flat, as expected. Small container volumes included an 80 basis point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have increased 80 basis points. Volumes decreased 2.8% in the residential business. The decrease was expected, based upon our strategic decision not to renew certain contracts that fell below our return of criteria.","The post collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 1.3%. Landfill volume was essentially flat. Growth in MSW and C&D was offset by a decrease in special waste. More specifically, landfill MSW volume increased 1.8% and C&D volume increased 8.3%. Special waste volume decreased 4.5% due to a difficult comp in the prior year.","The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees, which increased 60 basis points. The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel increased to $3.19 in the second quarter from $2.55 in the prior year, an increase of 25%. The current average diesel price is $3.22 per gallon.","The next component, energy services revenue increased 20 basis points. This is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin, where we continue to be well-positioned. The final component of internal growth is recycling processing and commodity revenue, which decreased 1.4%. The decrease in revenue primarily relates to lower recycle commodity prices and tons sold. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 42% to $91 per ton in the second quarter, down from $157 per ton in the prior year.","As Don discussed earlier, recycling continues to be a headwind. But it's important to note that recycling processing and commodity revenue represents less than 5% of Republic's total revenue. Additionally, beginning in Q4 of this year and into 2019, we expect the recycling headwind to decrease as the prior-year comps become easier.","Next, I will discuss changes in margin. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 180 basis points to 27.4% versus 29.2% in the prior year. This included 50 basis points of expansion from the solid waste business, which was more than offset by 190 basis point headwind from recycling and a 40 basis point headwind from increasing fuel prices during the quarter.","Our fuel recovery fee lags changes in diesel prices. Therefore, in a rising fuel price environment, we face a temporary headwind. In the second quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 10%. For the full year, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 10.4%. Second quarter 2018 interest expense was $97 million, which included $10 million of noncash amortization.","Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.7%, which was lower than expected due to the resolution of an open tax matter. The lower tax rate provided a $0.01 benefit to EPS relative to the prior year. In the second half of the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% due to tax planning opportunities.","Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.73, an increase of $0.12 or 20% over the prior year. EPS included a $0.12 benefit from tax reform, which was offset by a $0.10 headwind from recycling. Adjusted free cash flow for the first half of the year was $679 million, an increase of 89% versus the prior year. The growth in free cash flow was due to solid growth in EBITDA and a favorable benefit from the timing of working capital, which we expect to partially reverse in the second half of the year.","Next, we returned $320 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This included 3.2 million shares repurchased for approximately $215 million. And finally, as Don mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our full year 2018 EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. If recycled commodities remain at July levels of approximately $95 per ton, we expect to be at the low end of our guidance ranges.","At this time, operator, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question today will come from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon. The first question is just around M&A. Don, you sort of raising the tuck-ins that you're doing. Historically, I think you said $100 million tuck-ins. Today, it's running a lot higher. Just curious what the pipeline overall looks like. And at what point do you sort of run into sort of antitrust? I guess you're at $10 billion in revenue today. Can you get the $15 billion before that's an issue or just maybe size up your pipeline longer term?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well. Look, if you think about the industry being $60 billion and what do we say $30 billion of it's still in the hands of private entrepreneurs.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","35%.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","35%. So, there is a big chunk out there. The issue really comes to \u2013 and you've heard me say this before most likely, we're not incenting people to sell their businesses. We're buying good quality businesses from good quality operators. People are getting to a place in the life cycle of their business where selling the company is an option. And that may be because of their life plan, their succession plan, their age, you name it. But it's been a good robust pipeline. We think the pipeline remains robust into next year. We think we continue to deploy, call it that, $100 million, $150 million a year for several years at least because that's sort of the timetable or the sales cycle, the pipeline we look at.","So as far as your antitrust question, when you think about this business, it still remains a local business. When we think about having a first or second market position, which we do across 95% of our revenue, having a first market position may mean \u2013 it may start with the fact that you're vertically integrated, but it may mean you only have a market share of 25% or 30%. And so, there's plenty of room to grow our share of a market through tuck-in acquisitions for quite a few years to come.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And just a follow-up question on recycling. The actions you're taking are very encouraging. I guess, it revolves mostly around contract renegotiations. And so, just curious whether you think you have to spend capital in the recycling business today or maybe at a later stage or maybe that's off the table? And then maybe for Chuck, is the recycling headwind $0.30 that's baked into the guidance? Thank you.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","All right. I'll start and let Chuck finish up. I think you asked three questions there, Hamzah. So, the first one is, look \u2013 and I may have to say it a couple of more times on this call, because I'm sure it's on everyone's mind. And I said it in the prepared remarks. This issue that we're facing right now emanating from China, while it's really painful in 2018, it really is overall a good thing. And so, I'm really optimistic about this serving as the catalyst needed to actually change, then fix the business. So as we said before, recycling is a product our customers want to buy. It's a growing part of the waste stream. It's a business we want to be in because we want to be a good partner to our customers.","The fact is our customers are voting with their wallets and they are paying more for recycling. We've been very effective raising prices in the open market on recycling without losing volume. It's the contractual nature of the municipal business, contracts that are sort of five years on average, and the nature of municipal budgets and sort of a political aspect of too many decision makers in the process that slow us down there.","But the good news is individuals, consumers want to recycle, staff wants to recycle and certainly city councils and mayors don't want to give up recycling. So, we think there is a lot of room here to finally fix the business. I said in my remarks, we've talked to the lion's share of our 1,100 customers already and we're getting good results. We've already renegotiated some contracts with new pricing ahead of the contract date. We have a lot of customers already taking our advice and thinking about new ways to do things.","We certainly have a handful of customers who kind of scoffed at it. We'll have to reassess whether we like that partnership or not. Partnership's a two-way street. We're making a lot of progress. There is a lot of room for pricing here and we're going to really use this opportunity to fix this business.","And the one point I'll make too is when we break this down to the absolute lowest common denominator, a household, a household is paying on average in the country $25 a month for twice-a-week service; one's for trash, one's recycling. Let's say that's $20 on trash and $5 on recycling. That $5 needs to be $10 or $12.","So, we're not talking about amount of money that breaks the bank for an individual rate payer and that's what lawmakers, city councils, and people need to understand. And I think the average citizen who wants to recycle and do good things for the environment will be more than willing to do that to make this right. And so, that is the road we're going down.","So, as far as CapEx, we will invest in CapEx. These won't be new facilities. These will be some advanced technology. So we've already invested some CapEx in sorting equipments, some robotics, things like that. We'll continue to do that, but that won't be a material change in our capital spending, Hamzah. I'll turn it over to Chuck.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. To Hamzah, in terms of your question, so in our guide right now is $0.30 to $0.32 of headwind associated with recycling business. And the good news is that that's been offset by the solid waste business. The solid waste business continues to perform very, very well.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just a question on cost inflation. I think we're seeing just general labor tightness. Obviously, trucking drivers is more of a long-haul situation. But I guess kind of general inflation out there. Some others in the industry has suggested you're kind of seeing 4% to 5% rates. So I was wondering if you can kind of validate what you're seeing? And then kind of related to that as we exit this year and go into next year, what sort of a yield net pricing do you think you need to keep margins flat in the current environment?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Okay. Again, a multi-faceted question. So, let's start with labor. We are seeing some increases in labor cost, in direct labor and that is a result \u2013 let's start with the good news, right. That is the result of a strong economy. So, the underlying factor here is a strong economy. A strong economy helps our business beat (25:02) from a growth perspective. The fact that there are some labor increase also drives some inflation across the board and we've always said a little inflation is good for us. Remember, we've got a big chunk of business still. Even though we're making a big dent in that restricted market, we still have some business that escalates with CPI. So, the fact that there's a little more inflation that will come back to us through CPI pricing as well.","As relates to labor for us, we are in some markets, in select markets raising some wages and, frankly, rethinking some of our pay plans. Because here's the thing, we're focused on being an employer of choice, being a great place to work, attracting the best and brightest people. We're going to continue to do that, we believe the market pay.","But the backdrop to that is our turnover is low. And it's dramatically lower than general industry. It's lower than trucking by a long shot. And in the waste space, we think our turnover is lower than anybody's, and specifically drivers and techs \u2013 in fact, our tech turnover went down year-over-year. So again, when we talk about employee engagement, do the right thing by people, and being that great place to work, we're really serious about it, and that's one of the things, I think, that's helped us offset some of these pressures in the labor market.","But we'll see a little pressure there. And then as it relates to some of the long-haul waste transfer business, we'll see a little pressure there. But the fact is, if those are structural changes, that allows us a room to price, right, because these type of things affect all companies. They don't just affect one company. We think they'll affect us less because of our focus on people and talent and turnover and the work environment. But we'll use the opportunity for pricing and we'll gain the advantage from how it affects CPI.","In all other instances, there's a delay. Right? You've got to review, but we're being responsive. So, we'll see more price in the second half of the year. Our RPM process, which you know is we don't just price once a year all the same time, we price throughout the year. So we've got still four buckets of price through the remainder of the year that we can lever up on in the open market, we'll do that to start to make up for it. And we'll push for pricing that looks more like a 3% yield, frankly. And that's the conversations we're having internally.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. One on recycling, this is maybe a little bit of a bigger picture. One, not trying to get too much into the ins and outs of China and what's going on, but a lot of commodity markets, when you see a demand shock, like we've seen from China, prices reset lower like we've seen. But then there's oftentimes a supply response.","Recycling seems very different. Sort of the future that you're portraying is one where really there won't be much change in supply. Everyone wants to do the right thing. My question is sort of, is there a place to put all of this material if China follows through on some of its proposals?","Today, are you able to actually place all these tons somewhere in the world, albeit at a lower price and not a great margin? And maybe you can kind of also just comment on how much you're actually exporting to China today that you would have to move to other markets if they did truly come out of the market?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, to use easy math, we're still about 60% domestic and about 40% that we export, right. And again, that's general math. Don't hold me to those exact numbers. But use 60\/40 to make the discussion easy. We've moved material away from China. We're virtually sending nothing to China today. We're still very closely in contact with our partners in China who have had to shut down a capacity because there is no inflow of material.","They, I think, would agree with us, the demand for packaging is not lessening. In fact, most people you talk to, if not all people you talk to, believe that two things are true. The demand for paper packaging is going to continue to increase. If people continue to use virgin fiber pulp, then the price for pulp's going to continue to increase. And then we get into this nice supply and demand economy again.","The fact that we've been able to move paper pretty easily to other markets says a lot about our team and our capability and the fact that the packaging demand remains. And then just like in the big macro picture, the fact that you've got \u2013 and you can argue where and how much, but sort of an expanding economy of people who want to buy goods and services, right? So, you want to call it a middle class or an emerging class in markets globally.","So, I think those macro trends continue, so the demand will be there. The supply, I think, when we talk to customers, they want to recycle, in the open market, the fact that we've aggressively raised prices on recycling and haven't lost customers, because frankly people are saying, hey, I'm okay paying just about as much for recycling as I do for trash, because I've got to carry it out to my dumpster anyways, I might as well feel good about doing something for the environment. And that's \u2013 I'm oversimplifying. That's generally the vibe that we're getting from our customers.","So, we're going to continue to be a good partner. This is going to be a slow go as we continue to turn contracts over. The supply\/demand economy is global, so it's going to take time. There are going to be other investments in domestic mills. These Chinese mills are going to look for other ways to clean up the paper, and there's a lot of ideas on the table. So, this will take a few years to work out.","And in the meantime, as I said, and I'll say it over and over again, this in the long term is a good thing. We at Republic Services run the business for the long term. We don't get excited about something that's temporary in nature that makes our quarter hard or our year hard. This is going to be a good thing when we're all said and done, and it'll take a little time to sort out, but we're being very opportunistic and very optimistic.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. If we could start with volume, it's been a couple of quarters of positive volume here and 1Q was particularly strong. As we get into the back half, obviously, the special waste comps get tougher, and I'm looking at your kind of original volume guidance for the year. Just wondering \u2013 and it may be something we should all be aware of as we go into the back half \u2013 how should we expect kind of those headline volumes to trend over the course of 2H? Will they kind of go flat or even negative? Just how to think about that so we're modeling appropriately?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, Noah. Probably, a little negative in the second half of the year. But right now, we had guided to zero to 25 basis points of volume growth for the year. And right now, we're thinking we're going to at or slightly above that 25 basis points.","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","And then, Noah, I just would add to that, as Chuck mentioned, we might be flat to slightly negative in the back half. But if you exclude that difficult solid waste or \u2013 excuse me, special waste comp and the non-regrettable losses, we'd be looking at, for the second half, volume growth pretty similar to the first half.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, that's a great point. Right? So, I think we should focus on that, because that's the trend \u2013 the underlying trend in the business. And I think it also demonstrates the sort of internal discipline that we use when determining what business we're going to do, what business we're not going to do.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Right. So we're still in the sort of underlying 1% to 2% volume growth environment, and that should be understood when looking at these underlying metrics.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes, absolutely.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Second question, $700 million of buyback for the year is very strong. It does imply a bit of a deceleration from 1H. I guess there will be more spend on this targeted M&A in the back half, but anything else to read into there just in terms of how you're lining up the balance sheet?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","No, it's really the M&A. So, obviously, $50 million more than what we had anticipated. There are also a little bit more in terms of CapEx, about $20 million. It's what we're anticipating and that's really due to fund the growth that we're seeing in the business. Those are the moving items.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And actually, it looks like you increased your assumption of operating cash flow for the year, but you actually have a little higher CapEx to offset that, but your OCF is moving up from your original guidance, is that right?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Right. Yeah, it's correct.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Right on.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","All right. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Tyler.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Tyler.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, Chuck, can we maybe walk from the 29.2% to the 27.4%, the EBITDA margins, maybe with a little bit more color here? So, I get the positive 50 basis points from solid waste, the 190 basis points from recycling, which I'm assuming includes dilution from ReCommunity, and the 40 basis point fuel math, but SG&A was an 80 basis point tailwind. So, does that imply that core, core solid waste margins were down even ex-fuel, which quite frankly is debatable whether that should be in there or not?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, keep in mind that the fuel \u2013 there's a lag on the fuel, right. And so, in a rising fuel environment, we get a little bit of a headwind associated with that. And obviously, that reverses when fuel goes in the opposite direction when it decreases. What Don had talked about is that we're beginning to see a little bit more wage inflation in the core business and that's happening in select markets. And that is actually eating into a little bit that SG&A benefit, Tyler, that we saw down \u2013 below operating expenses. But once again, that's something that we're aware of and something that the pricing team is going to take into consideration second half of this year and into 2019 as we develop our pricing strategy.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So, it sounds like core solid waste is very solid. You're converting more to higher CPI, CPI is improving. I mean all indications are the open market remains very rational. So, why are we seeing price decelerate specifically in the restricted, but I guess frankly in both, decelerate sequentially? I mean, I get the lack of the fee from last year in the restricted piece, but again why the decel sequentially?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","So on the restricted piece, we anniversaried a significant price increase with a very large municipal customer, and so you see a little bit of a price decrease there, sequentially. But once again, we said that's going to pick up in the second half of the year, right? And I would say, in the open market, the core prices continues to be very, very strong. This is the 20th quarter in a row that we've seen core price at 4% or higher in the open market. So, we continue to perform very, very well there.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. And Tyler, as Chuck said, I'm sure a lot of our Republic leaders are listening, a lot of our field leaders, general managers, and sales managers are listening. They know the pricing is going to be picking up in the second half. We're going to recoup some of this recycling. We're going to take advantage of the growing market. I said, defection is down sub-7%, almost as low as 6%, the second quarter in a row. We've got more room and \u2013 we've got more room to price in the market. We've got a reason to price with the recycling issues in China and with some of this labor costs. And then CPI is going to pick up, right, because we're going to start to see those second half reset, so it will start to come back.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Did I hear you, Don, talk about 3% yields in the back half or was that more an aspirational comment?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes, that's not the back half, but that's where we think we can go, right. And we've been there before. That's not a number we've never seen. And it's in this kind of a growing economy with a strong CPI, with good organic growth, that does impact market behavior, and we think we can get back there.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Because going back to one of the prior questions, I mean there is a lot of inflation in the system, it's not just labor, but whether it's transportation, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, big picture, does \u2013 2.1% yield is probably not enough in this inflationary environment, even excluding recycling to really get sustainable solid waste margin expansion. Would you agree with that?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. With inflationary environment, we've got to be north of that, and you heard the comments said earlier, we're going to \u2013 I mean that's where we got to go.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just my last one here. Chuck, maybe a tax rate for next year, I know there's some moving pieces here this year.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, the statutory tax rate's going to be a little over 27%. And so, without giving guidance, right now that's kind of our best guesstimate, maybe a little bit less than that.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Sorry, 27%","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","27%, right.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Don, Chuck, Nicole, for taking my question. There's a little bit of a windup on this one, because I'm trying to flesh out something that, I think, is being missed. So if I started with your original outlook for the components of your \u2013 the bottom end of the range, $3.05 in February, and I look at where you are today at $3.05, my math says you've got an almost 35% improvement sequentially in the performance of the solid waste business inside that forecast.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, there is an improvement in the solid waste business, Michael. Let me try and figure the easiest way to explain this. Let me do it this way. So, original guidance of $3.05 to the $3.10, right? A recycling headwind right now, we're saying, is going to be about $0.26. Right? But improvement in the solid waste business, above and beyond what was in the original guidance, of $0.10. And then you've got $0.04 from the CNG tax credit, and then another $0.12 from the tax rate. And that's what gets you back to the $3.05 to the $3.10. But to your point, the solid waste portion of the business is performing better than we originally expected.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So you said that really fast, all that. Just so I get it \u2013 make sure we have the numbers correct. There's $0.12 from tax reform for the whole year?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","No, $0.12 from tax rate, not from tax reform.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Tax rate, yeah.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","The benefit from tax reform, and this is important, that was already included in the $3.05 to $3.10 that was already included in our original guidance. So, the remaining $0.12 in tax rate, that's other tax opportunities that we were able to take advantage of this year.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right, okay. What I was trying to do is bridge the $2.43 that you finished \u2013 that compares to the $3.05. And what I concluded if I took the headwind from recycling, added back tax reform and then looked at what solid waste was, there's a clear sequential improvement versus where you started the year.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Absolutely. So, think about it this way. The solid waste piece of the business is up 16% from where we thought it would be.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","In our original guidance.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Since the last 10 people asked 45 questions. Can I ask one more?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Sure, Michael, even we only had a big windup.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. How much capital do you have tied up in recycling? And what does the revenue margin mix need to look like to generate a reasonable return on that capital?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Here's what I would say, is that right now, we're getting a decent return on recycling, but it's not where it needs to be. We need something a little bit higher and that's why we're focused on all of these different action items, the pricing and also on taking costs out of the system. So, obviously, the headwind that we're seeing with commodity prices, $160 million roughly year-over-year, it's huge. But we are very confident that we have the action items in place and the people in place to fix this portion of the business, and we will get an appropriate return on the business.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Just so I understand, you are generating a positive return on capital on that business as bad as it is?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","I would say that the return on capital is positive, but it's not where it needs to be.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, remember, we've talked about this before, I think on this call, there are three ways that we deal sort of with recycling, right? One is, where we go out and collect it in the open market with our small container, large container business, where we're negotiating really directly with customers, one-on-one kind of negotiations with proprietors and decision makers.","In that business, we have been raising prices over the last couple of years and here more recently very effectively. And when I say customers have voted with their wallets, those customers have said, I want to continue to recycle, even though recycling now costs almost as much as trash removal for those customers. So, that has been a good business for us.","We have a lane, if you will, where waste \u2013 or recycling material comes to our facilities that we don't collect. We've been pretty effective in getting that business converted and there's more work to do, but those customers have been open to the conversation and we're moving that business.","And then, the last is this big municipal piece, right? And as I said in my comments, the actual rate payer is paying very little per month for recycling. So, the idea of doubling or tripling their rate is miniscule in the scheme of things, it's a cup of designer coffee. I'm not a coffee drinker. But it's not that much compared to what they pay for cable, for Internet, for all of their other sort of habits.","Trash and recycling is sort of a necessary service, and recycling is something they want to do. But when you aggregate that spend to 10,000 residents, then the decision maker gets nervous, right, because it becomes a big dollar amount. We've got to continue to break it down to the lowest denominator. And those are conversations we're having, because the consumer, ultimately, the voter, wants to recycle and they want a company like Republic, that's a good partner, that will do the job for them.","We're only going to invest in recycling where the returns are warranted and where the construct of the contract is fair and reasonable and equitable. And we're going to, along the way, find partners. They're great partners. And we're going to, along the way, find partners who we're going to have to reevaluate the value of their partnership, because they don't want to understand this. That's what we're at. And that's okay, because this business will sort of work through that. And so again, it's a good opportunity. It's a stinker right now in 2018, but we're \u2013 the strength of solid waste is overtaking it. There'll be headwind in 2019 and 2020 as we start to climb out of it \u2013 I mean, tailwind.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Thanks, guys. I believe you were originally expecting underlying EBITDA margins expanding 10 basis points to 30 basis points for the year. What's your new expectations for that now? I don't know if you guys \u2013 I know we see the EPS guide, but just what is \u2013 the first half, I think, you did 1.39x (46:32) of adjusted EBITDA. What's the expectation in the back half? It seems like you need some sequential ramp up to get there. So, I was hoping you guys could help just kind of bridge that. And how much of that is Q3 versus Q4?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So for the year, we're expecting EBITDA margin to be about 28%. And just to put that in context for you, what we're expecting right now is solid waste margin expansion of 60 basis points to 80 basis points, and then recycling being a headwind about 120 basis points to 140 basis points. And we are, obviously, expecting the margins to improve in the back half of the year. Once again, on the back of the solid \u2013 the continued strength in the solid waste business.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And is that more \u2013 sorry, is that more like fourth quarter weighted?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","It goes down Q \u2013 It actually goes down Q3 to Q4, steps down a little bit, as you would expect because of the seasonality in the business.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And I guess, just my last question would be, you mentioned volumes \u2013 underlying volumes of 1% to 2% range. Should we be thinking about \u2013 with the economy the way it's been progressing and the momentum, should we be thinking 2019 close to that 2% range? And just on the average yield discussion, we were talking about 3%, I mean, is there a room for the pricing? Is it just to cover the rising cost or is there a room for that price\/cost dynamic to inflect higher in 2019?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","All right. So, first of all, this isn't our 2019 guidance call, okay?","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Look, Mike, first, on the growth, the underlying growth, 1% to 2%, we think that's realistic. Give us a little time to see how the rest of the year comes in and how things sort of normalize. But the underlying fundamentals, again, population growth, household formation, all things we look at still indicate there's room to run. You know that we're well-situated across our markets with strong position. We get our fair share of the growth along the way. So, we've got high confidence in that. We'll talk \u2013 we'll file a report on 2019 when we get to that junction, right.","On pricing, especially hear this, right, we've seen 3% and 3.5% yields in the past when the economy has been strong. We're enjoying one of the strongest economies we've seen in a long time. And we've got a really great story to tell and the economy in the solid waste business is what is overcoming this struggle with recycling, but we're going to fix that too. So, my point about 3% price, as Tyler said, that is aspirational, but it's very doable.","And there's conversation we're having today in the building. We're talking with our revenue management team and we're taking with our operating team, and we're having those conversations, because \u2013 and the market will allow it, the value we provide will allow it, and there are some structural changes that we take a fairness approach with customers that we can go ask for legitimately.","And CPI is \u2013 almost $600 million now of the restricted book now is converted. We're going to continue \u2013 we're not done yet. We're going to hit $600 million, then we're going to take on $700 million. So CPI, by itself, is on the rise. So, all these things are good factors. I mean the fact that the underlying solid waste business is strong, a good economy, operationally, we're solid, the fact that we've got this great workforce and low turnover, we've got a ton of other metrics that we watch that we don't share with you, obviously, that all tell us really story.","We're going to continue to build on the success and then we're going to turn this recycling thing around and it's going to be a happy day. So, more to come. And these things start to anniversary into 2019 and help us build a strong 2019. And that wasn't guidance.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Good job.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you, Don.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, guys, it's Henry Chien, good afternoon, calling for Jeff. Just a follow-up on some of the points you're making. I'm just curious of how you're thinking about the overall capacity of the business. If volume growth picks up, are you kind of prepared at least given the wage inflation to ramp up hiring? And I'm just kind of curious with sort of your increasing CapEx, does that sort of suggest you need to sort of invest in new improvements to make things more efficient given the wage inflation, just however you're thinking about capacity for the business? Thanks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, first of all, as far as CapEx goes, we've always guided, CapEx is 10% of revenue. So when revenue's growing, as volume's growing, deploying CapEx to capture that volume, that's the best way our owners would like us to see us deploy cash, right? So, we do that very effectively.","There's not latent capacity in the business because the business has been growing for some time now. So, as it relates to the staffing model, again, we have low turnover. We've held the line very well year-over-year. Some of this wage inflation that we talked about is in select markets, but we're handling that well. And in fact, our time to fill open positions is actually down year-over-year. And we track a lot of really cool metrics here.","So, our people are doing a great job of attracting good people. We've got great training programs to bring people into the pipeline. So, I think we're poised to again handle the growth that comes us. Remember, solid waste, that 1% to 2% organic growth, we're not talking about light speed here. But when you factor in a very nice steady diet of 1% to 2% volume, price in excess of inflation, the model sings a very nice song and we're going to continue to build on a great cash flow.","So, as someone would like to say, follow the cash. Look at the cash flow of the business. We're very happy with what we're doing in the underlying business. And frankly, we're very certain that this is the moment when the waste industry is going to fix this recycling thing for good.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Mr. Slager for any closing remarks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you, Austin. In closing, I think as I just said we're very pleased with our second quarter performance, strong solid waste fundamentals together with relentless operational execution. I love when the team is relentless. Resulting in a double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow. And despite the recycling headwinds, we are reiterating our original guidance, which represented 20% growth in earnings and free cash flow per share versus the prior year. We will continue to manage the business, create long-term value and remain focused on executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation.","I'd like to thank the entire Republic team, all the employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and creating this thing we called The Republic Way.","Thanks, everybody.

And finally, I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We built upon our strong start to the year and delivered another solid quarter. We achieved higher levels of pricing and volume growth, made continued progress on our multi-year initiatives and reported double-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow. We continue to see positive momentum in our business from the successful execution of our strategy and improvement in the fundamentals that impact our business, which was the premise for our 2017 business plan.","Highlights of the quarter include adjusted EPS was $0.61, an 11% increase over the prior year. EPS was positively impacted by strong growth in both price and volume and higher recycled commodity prices.","Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $358 million and in line with our expectations. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow per share was $1.05, an increase of approximately 8% over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA increased $42 million or 6% over the prior year.","Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28%. Total revenue grew 7.5%, our highest level in over eight years. Core price was 4.1%. Average yield was 2.5% and was strongest in our small container and large container businesses.","Majority of these customers are in open markets, where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform. In our small container business, average yield was 4.2%, our highest level of pricing in over seven years.","Second quarter volumes increased 1.9%. The volume growth was broad based and was strongest in the event-driven portion of our disposal business. Year-to-date, we've invested $91 million in tuck-in acquisitions, which will improve our operating density and further strengthen our market positions. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we have returned $454 million of cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This included 3.8 million shares repurchased for approximately $237 million.","Additionally, our board approved an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend. This is consistent with our historical practice of raising the dividend in the mid to high single-digit range. The annualized dividend is now $1.38 per share.","Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, we now have approximately $440 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index or fixed-rate increase of 3% or greater for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more clearly aligned with our cost structure and have historically run higher than CPI.","Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 19% of our fleet now operates on compressed natural gas, 75% of our residential fleet is automated and our entire fleet is now certified under our OneFleet maintenance program. As a result of our standardized maintenance program, we have seen an improvement in cost per engine hour, greater fleet reliability, fewer unscheduled repairs and lower technician turnover.","Additionally, we are in the process of extending the useful life of our fleet by one year, which will save us $200 million in capital expenditures. We've already realized over $100 million of savings and expect the remaining savings in the next two to three years.","Finally, I'd like to give you an update on the talent pillar of our strategy. We believe that an engaged, empowered and diverse team is another way we differentiate ourselves. We've been steadily building on our employee engagement and diversity and inclusion programs over the last several years in an effort to make Republic Services an employer of choice, one where the best people come to work.","This year, we were named to the named to the Forbes 2017 America's Best Employers list and the Ethisphere World's Most Ethical Companies list. And most recently, we received the Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award. The Forbes and Glassdoor awards are specially meaningful and that our employees from across the country are the ones who voted to put Republic on these lists. It is through our employees' collective voices that Republic's culture and company story is being shared and the true litmus test of the impact we are making here at Republic.","Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Don. Second quarter revenue was approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $176 million or 7.5% over the prior year This 7.5% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 7.2% and acquisitions of 30 basis points. The components of internal growth are as follows: First, average yield increased 2.5%. Average yield in the collection business was 3.1%, which included 4.2% yield in the small container business, 3% yield in the large container business and 1.9% yield in the residential business.","Average yield in the post-collection business was 80 basis points, which included landfill MSW of 1.8%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions.","Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 4.1%. Core price consisted of 5.3% in the open market and 2.2% in the restricted portion of our business. Pricing in the restricted portion of our business benefited from an improved inflationary environment and our focus on earning an appropriate return on our contracts as they renew.","The second component of internal growth is total volume, which increased 1.9% over the prior year. Volumes in the collection business increased 40 basis points. This included a 1.9% increase in our large container business and a 50 basis point increase in our residential business, partially offset by a 90 basis point decrease in our small container business. Small container volumes included a 140 basis point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have increased 50 basis points.","Within our large container business, temporary C&D hauls were up 1.7% and recurring hauls were up 1.9%. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 8.7%. Landfill volumes increased 8.4% which included C&D of 17.5%, special waste of 15% and MSW of 1.1%.","The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees, which increased 60 basis points. The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.55 in the second quarter from $2.30 in the prior year, an increase of 11%. The current average diesel price is $2.51 per gallon.","The next component, energy services revenue, increased 70 basis points. The growth in energy services revenue is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin where we are well positioned.","And the final component of internal growth is commodity revenue, which increased 1.5%. The growth in commodity sales revenue primarily relates to increase in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 35% to $157 per ton in the second quarter from $116 per ton in the prior year. The average commodity price in June was approximately $160 per ton. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased 49% primarily due to an increase in rebates.","Now, I'll discuss changes in margin. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28%, which compares to 28.3% in the prior year. The change includes a 40 basis point increase in landfill operating costs. As discussed in the first quarter, we continued to see higher costs associated with the change in operating requirements at one of our sites. We also saw an increase in leachate volumes at a handful of our sites. These costs are temporary in nature and we expect the higher landfill operating costs to abate over the next few quarters.","Excluding the increase in landfill operating costs, we had 10 basis points of margin expansion from strong pricing and volume growth, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.","Second quarter 2017 interest was $90 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 39.1%. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year.","Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $358 million, which represents 6% growth over the prior year. We remain comfortable with our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $875 million to $900 million, which represents double-digit growth over the prior year, after adjusting for the change in cash taxes.","Now I'll turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. To conclude, we are pleased with our second quarter performance, strong fundamentals, together with solid operational execution, resulted in 7.5% top line growth and double-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow. Given our solid performance in the first half of the year, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance range. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $2.36 to $2.39, which is an increase from our original guidance range of $2.32 to $2.36.","At this time, operator, we'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon and thank you so much for taking the questions. Congrats on the strong quarter.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Noah.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you, thank you. MSW volumes, just to start out, kind of a little bit lagging as it has for several quarters now kind of the growth in some of these other categories, C&D, special was very strong obviously this quarter. Can you just (15:22) how to think about the trajectory of MSW going forward with the course of the rest of the year? Is this kind of potentially growing at a lag to some of these other categories given your footprint in some higher growth areas of the country? Thanks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","We'll think about this, right. We've always said that we're in a slow growth business, right, depends on population growth, housing formation and that those dynamics are all pretty consistent and strong. We're still only at a sort of 1.2 million of household formation, there is room to grow as that gets back to some kind of a new norm. And remember, as we talked about some of the volume impact is due to some of the loss in the broker business, which is an intentional strategic decision, right. So we've seen very broad-based recovery, very broad-based volume across the entire book of business. So, we feel pretty good about it and again we just raised our guidance, thinking, saying that the first half performers is going to continue through the second half of the year.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just thinking about the puts and takes of free cash flow for the rest of the year and maybe just focusing on the CapEx, how should we think about kind of the pace of CapEx spend over the course of the rest of the year?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, so far we spent about 53% of our CapEx first half of the year. As we look at over the rest of the year, obviously we had very strong volume growth first half of the year and therefore because of that we may need to increase our capital spending to fund that growth. And that's why we haven't changed our free cash flow guidance.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Got it. And if I could just sneak one more in, obviously COGS went up significantly resulting from the recycling rebates. Can you just tell us, to what extent was recycling incremental or decremental to EBITDA margins in the quarter?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. It was obviously accretive to the margins, but keep in mind that when you're talking about the COGS that 20% of the tons that we handled are brokered by us. So, if you actually exclude those volumes and those brokered volumes, then our sale of materials and our COGS went up by a similar rate of approximately 30%.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","That's extremely helpful. Thanks so much.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Please go ahead.","Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Thank you. This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Congratulations on the quarter.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks. How are you doing, Ken?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Ken.","Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Doing well. Just wondering whether you can comment on the M&A environment and specifically any change in the quality of opportunities you're seeing and what is your view of recent multiples.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, as we reported, we spent $91 million in the first half of the year. We started the goal with a $100 million spend kind of a \u2013 in our site. So we'll easily hit the $100 million target for the year. I would say the pipeline is full. As far as what we're spending on deals, it's still pretty consistent with our historical sort of 4.5 times to 5 times EBITDA post synergy. So as you know, this gets a little lumpy occasionally a bigger deal comes along, it's a lot of work to close a lot of smaller deals, but we feel good about the trajectory. So we're \u2013 again that's part of the guidance raised for the second half of the year.","Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Thank you. And any thoughts on China's recent announcements that it will ban imports of certain waste materials like scrap plastics, do you think this will have any effect on Republic?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, again, I don't have a crystal ball, but here is what I'll tell you. This is not the first time we've seen this kind of thing from China. We've been through this a number of times in our past. So we have a very high quality pack that we make whether it's fiber or plastics. We've never had an issue with quality rejection in our history. So even in times when supply and demand kind of shifts, we've never had a slowdown on shipping our material, so we've got a really good track record.","And then, the fact is not all of our sub goes to China, right. So really only what about 35% goes to China and there is a lot more domestic capacity than people realize and a great deal of our fiber, specifically, still remains domestic. And most of that China business is going from the West Coast ports and again those West Coast (20:00) that we operate have a very strong track record in quality.","Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Thanks for the color and congratulations again.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. I know you don't provide specific guidance beyond free cash flow and adjusted EPS, but I'm just curious, with the increase in your adjusted EPS guidance, where is that coming from? Is it more from a revenue perspective, more from a margin perspective, a mix, any color would be great?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So obviously, we posted a very strong revenue first half of the year, so that's where that EPS guidance increase is coming from and then that's been partially offset and what I talked about earlier about the temporary increase that we're seeing in our landfill operating costs, so it's the net of those two.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","In terms of that temporary increase in the landfill operating costs, when do you expect that to go away? Is that something we'll see over the course of this year or is that something more over the course of the next year or so?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, we say over the next few quarters, most of that's going to take place this year.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question will come from Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So I just wanted to dig into the margin profile a little bit. Obviously, when the year started, you guys provided some commentary and I get that things have certainly changed. But you laid out 28.5% to 28.7% EBITDA margins for 2017. I certainly respect that recycling is flowed through at a lower rate here, but any commentary on how we should think about what's inherently baked into the guide for EBITDA margin in the back half of the year?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So when we look at the back half of the year, obviously we're expecting expansion in the margins and that's really coming from the strong revenue. At the same time, as I had talked about before though, these landfill costs are going to slowly abate. So, we're going to have that headwind associated with also. So as we're looking at the margin, it's kind of longer term. We're thinking that we're going to be flat for the year. But if you take out the landfill operating costs, then that would get us right back to the 30 or 40 basis points of expansion that we had anticipated.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then, changing gears, on the SG&A front, obviously the salary component was up about 12%. Can you just help us understand how the incentive comp flows through for the rest of the year?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, in terms of the incentive comp, keep in mind that we had an adjustment last year to incentive compensation that didn't repeat this year. And so obviously, our incentive is currently at levels that are consistent with our guidance for the rest of the year.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Noah (sic) [Joe].","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. On the first part, on the margin, I think I heard you say there was a 10 basis points expansion from strong pricing and volume growth when we take out the higher costs from the landfills. That still feels pretty low with what you're seeing at energy services and the volumes that are coming through. Is that something typical? The 10 basis points, is that typical at this point of the cycle and how should we think about the mix of the business as volumes are starting to grow and it's becoming a little bit more broad-based?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. This is Don. When \u2013 I'll let you think about that Chuck. I don't know that there is typical, right, when you think and you said it, what about the mix, right? So there is geographic mix, there is line of business mix. You start digging through some of that. There is this difference between rising fuel cost net. There is the net between sale of goods and cost of goods. So those things impact the margins, right. So, I don't think there is any typical.","We're very confident in the business. Look at the $42 million of additional EBITDA we generated in the quarter year-over-year and we're still confident we're going to raise the margin. We're still internally focused on pushing the margins to 30%. But we're here to run the business for the long term and that's how we roll. So when it comes to dealing with some of these temporary costs, we're going to take them head on. We're going to deal with it. We got to get it behind us. So, again I don't know that there is a typical answer. I don't think we can just frame it that easily.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think you should just drop the mic at that point and we'll walk away.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Okay. There you go, Chuck.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just my second question. When you think about the volumes, how did that look through the quarter and how is it shaping up so far in July?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, I think volumes are good. I mean, we're talking about 2% almost volume growth, right. And again in the best of times, 2.5% is a strong performance. So, we're bouncing off a 2% and that is including the broker business that we've chosen to move away from. So the team feels good about where we're at, about the trends going into Q3 and again we raised the guidance, which would indicate the confidence.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good afternoon.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","How are you?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey Brian.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Your average yield was really impressive, up 2.5%, and I think if I remember comments from earlier, you expected it to maybe accelerate in the back half of the year as some of the CPI uptick that we saw a couple of months back starts to kick in. Is that still the expectation that we would see that start to accelerate in the back half of the year?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So what happened is that we actually saw some of that acceleration in Q2 and that's why we're able to post a restricted price of 2.2%. So those resets have already started to happen. In addition to that, as I had mentioned before, we were able to actually renegotiate some of our contracts on favorable terms, those restricted contracts. So we've got that coming through under restricted price also. So as we look out for the rest of the year, we think that that restricted price and yield in general is going to be pretty much flat to where it was in Q2.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, just a modeling one on 3Q. I think there is one fewer work day, maybe you can confirm that. And if so, what kind of an impact on margins or volume might you expect from that?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So there is one less work day and obviously that work day is included in our guidance.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just on technology, maybe for Don. Where do you see the largest opportunity in your system? Is it on the customer side? Is it the route side? Is it the asset side? And sort of where are you guys in that process, early innings, mid-innings?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","So I would say both customer and route side. So we're, I think, in early innings of both. Certainly we use computer software to route our trucks today. There is better software out there. We're looking at expanding our digital capability into cab, so that our drivers' day becomes easier, so we can communicate more effectively with the driver. So we can bring, build some more productivity into system with digital, what we call digital operations.","There is obviously work to be done to still connect the cab to the customer and our digital platform. You've seen some of the work we've done with our app in our My Resource application. So more and more customers are signing up to do business with us digitally, so that's a good thing. So we're going to continue to move down that road and be \u2013 and we want to be the provider of choice with our customers and make it easy to do business with us. And again we wanted to try to find additional ways to build in some productivity with our driver base and if we can connect the drivers with the customers that's even a better thing.","As far as assets, we watch what happens in the marketplace, so we've got our fleet team, they are very much involved in the dialogue around what's going on with vehicles and all this talk of autonomy and so forth. But \u2013 so we'll be involved in the conversation, but I think that's something that kind of a premature, it's going to be a ways out there. I think there's going to be a lot of other industries who get automated and fully automated before the waste business does. But we are looking for ways to improve some parts of it, while we still have an operator in the cab.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And then just last question. I'll turn it over, maybe for Chuck. Maybe just longer term, how should investors think about your operating leverage framework? What I mean by that is longer term on 7.5% revenue growth, what should margins be up assuming, mix gets better, assuming some of these temporary costs go away, just maybe frame for investors how that operating leverage framework works. I realize Q2 is a little \u2013 there's some abnormalcies that I'm asking that, so?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Right. And what we had talked, obviously the revenue growth has been very, very strong and commodities has been strong also. If you were to pull there \u2013 as I said, if you were to pull out these one-time landfill costs we'd have achieved kind of the high end of our guidance range in terms of our EBITDA margin growth year-over-year. As we look out into the future as these costs abate, there is still nothing structural that we see that'll keep us from getting back to 30% EBITDA margins that we had talked about, so that still demonstrates the leverage that we expect from this business.","The other thing I would say also Hamzah is that it's not just the EBITDA that we're focusing on, it's also the cash flow. And I had a very wise man telling me one time that you can't spend EBITDA and we are focusing on the cash. And keep in mind that the cash flow guidance that we gave this year is double-digit when you adjust for cash taxes. So that's a very key metric for us also.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Right. That's helpful. That makes sense. Just a clarification question on, did you guys have CNG tax credits that went away or was that impactful at all or not material?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. It was impactful. Those credits went away this year, so we did not have those credits this year.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrew Buscaglia from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Andrew.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Just a quick one on your \u2013 on that \u2013 those higher costs that are impacting your margins. Why would that costs go away eventually that \u2013 can you just give us some confidence or how to think about that, that that's not going to dampen these margins just beyond three quarters or four quarters whatever you said, Chuck?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. This is Don. So, we've got a handful of sites, landfill sites that have some increased leachate volumes that we're handling that's part of it. Based on what we know about how those landfills operate, we think those will abate. We had some unbudgeted heavy equipment repairs that rather than fool around with, we just decided to continue to run the business, right? So, again, some of these costs are lumpy, but we're confident based on our analysis of the business and our local operating teams' ability to run the sites that these things will abate over the next few quarters.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then are there any contracts that you might have picked up recently that have higher costs associated with them? I mean, I know it sounds like it's on the landfill side, but could there be anything there?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","No.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","No, there's really no cost that we have that are impacting those landfill operating costs that Don had talked about.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","But again, when we think about where the volume grows back to mix, right, so we had 9.5% growth in our transfer station revenues, right? Transfer stations are generally viewed as kind of an extended gate of the landfill. We don't run a very \u2013 a super high operating margin or EBITDA margin on our transfer stations. Even though again they are profit centers, they don't run as high of a margin.","So, as I said, mix matters, geographic mix and line of business mix and some of these other puts and takes, so it's not quite as clean as you'd like to think. The good news, right, and the underlying thing that everyone used to remember is, it's broad-based recovery, it's across all lines, it's across all areas of the business, $42 million of additional EBITDA, and as you know we run the business for the long-term, we've raised guidance, we're confident of free cash flow, raised our dividend. I'm popped.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Sounds like it. All right. Thanks guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Tyler.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Don, so nice job on the labor line, I think it fell maybe 50 basis points. But I'm curious can you talk a little bit about frontline driver availability? Are you guys seeing any outsized unit cost inflation there difficulty in procuring drivers?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","No, in fact our driver turnover year-over-year is down Tyler. And I talked in my prepared remarks about the talent pillar of our agenda, right, of our strategy. We are very, very serious about becoming The Best Place to Work, where the best people come to work and we talk about how excited we are to receive the awards from Forbes and Glassdoor. Those are our real employees telling third-parties that they like working for us, right.","Our employee engagement scores are up year-over-year, all the things we do to genuinely make Republic a better place to be. Technician turnover is down, part of that is OneFleet, part of that is the overall engagement strategy. So, look, we've got some markets that have an incredibly low turnover. We got a few that we still need to work through, but overall net of net, we're pretty happy about where we're at, especially in a time when construction jobs are still growing, we'll hold onto our people. So, we feel pretty good about it.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, okay.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","And by the way maintenance costs looked pretty good this quarter too, huh Tyler.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I saw that. I did have a question on that.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Okay, shoot.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, I'll stick with maintenance. So I think you posted 9.3% it's, which is, it's down year-over-year, but it's still maybe 100 basis points above where it was maybe a couple of years ago. So now that we're kind of through the OneFleet rollout, how should we think about that line over the next couple of years?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, here's the reality, right. So, we still have quite a few trucks that lived well over the first half of their life in a non-OneFleet environment, and they weren't maintained maybe the way they should have been and those trucks are going to have a higher operating cost than they should have, if they had been maintained under our OneFleet umbrella.","So, over time as we continue to introduce 1,000 new vehicles a year to the fleet, and these 1,000 trucks roll off that were under maintained or neglected in some cases, we're going to see an improvement, right. So, we're also going to continue to see fleet reliability and all the other stuff that comes from that as well, right.","So, it's going to continue to benefit us and of course, there is also the CapEx savings that we'll see over time. And once we get through some of that, we're going to really put a finer point on this efficient frontier fleet and we maybe even able to age the fleet a little more at some point, right.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Okay, good. And then, Chuck, so if I look at it, it feels like back half margins need to be maybe 100 basis points better than the first half, which is very rough math. I get that the landfill operating cost of maybe 40 basis points will fall off. But what's the other 60 basis points? Is that just leverage or are there some other pieces there that we should think about?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, obviously there is leverage there that we had talked about. We expect that we're going to continue to be able grow that top line like we have. You've got the work day in Q3 which is a benefit for us also. So, it's a combination of all those factors.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Chuck and I are still going to come to work on that day.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","On that one \u2013 we are?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. We're still going to come to work.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Okay.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Not one less work day for you Chuck.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Okay. All right.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Well, all right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, Don, Chuck, Nicole, for taking my questions.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","It's nice to hear from you Michael.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","You too. Look forward to traveling next week. So, on the capital spending side, where do you think the budget which is $975 million \u2013 I'm not sure why somebody said there weren't a whole lot of details on your guidance there. You've got a whole page of them in your 4Q press release. But you had $975 million of property and equipment net of proceeds. Where do you think that number goes?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Like I said, Michael, it could go up a little bit because of the volume growth. Little bit could go up by $5 million, $10 million, maybe in that range.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, $5 million, $10 million is the way to think about it? Okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, somewhere in that range.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then you did $130 million-some in recycling in this quarter and if 20% of it's brokered and the other 80% isn't and you kind of assign a 5% margins to the brokered piece and a 20% margin to the non-brokered piece, and then you pull it out, your garbage business is doing like 28.6% margins. So, net of \u2013 it means so there is marginal leverage here, there is operating leverage here.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Absolutely, absolutely.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","There is Michael, and it goes back to what we had said before, is that if you pull out, just pull out the landfill operating costs, you've got 10 basis points of margin expansion during the quarter. And if you do that for the entire year, you've got 30 to 40 basis points of margin expansion. That's right on top of the guidance that we had given.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","So, yeah, the leverage is there.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","What's the cash hit for the incremental, because here's the other problem is that theoretically your cash should maybe show a little more oomph than it is. But this 40 basis points is cash, so what's the cash hit from that 40 basis points? Because really the guidance, you're at $875 million to $900 million, I get to add on free cash flow. I get to add that back too.","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, Michael, you can do the math. You can take the $2.5 billion of revenue times the 40 basis points in the quarter that we called out, 30 basis points in Q1. And that's all cash expense that's offsetting the strong revenue growth in the quarter.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And I should basically assume it's 40 basis points for the whole year on roughly $9 billion of revenues?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, 30 to 40, right.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So ex that what you think is non-recurring over time, even if I cut it in half, my free cash \u2013 the baseline free cash that is coming going into 2018 is north of $900 million nicely?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, with the leverage \u2013 with the \u2013 the top line growth that we have right now that's true, right.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","So, again, we talk about several times on the call, right, mix matters, right. And we are confident that the margins are expanding within the business, we got some of these highlights like recycling and fuel and some of the things that just net things out, but business is strong, the growth is good, pricing is good, operating team's doing a great job. We've got a couple of sort of near-term temporary and unusual things to take care of and then we should really I think end the year strong and move nicely into 2018.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. So just finite detail around the sales since you gave a 4.5% to 5% growth rate in February, clearly we're doing better than that. The 2Q price hold that for the remainder of the year, the one \u2013 the 2Q volume hold that for the rest of the year too?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","No. Right now, we're saying that we're going to be at the high-end of the range on the volume growth.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","You are already through that.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, you remember, you have seasonality.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","And you've got some special waste volumes also, the special waste volumes like I had talked about and the C&D volumes both really high in the second quarter.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. And those are seasonal for sure.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","3Q though should be a good special waste quarter typically because it's the best.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes, yes.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, okay.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Q3 is generally speaking our best quarter seasonally.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","And so there's...","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. All right.

Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and keep us on track to achieve our full-year financial guidance.","We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which is designed to profitably grow our business, generate consistent earnings and free cash flow growth and improve return on invested capital.","For the first quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.55 and adjusted free cash flow was $240 million, both representing double-digit growth over the prior year. EBITDA margin was 27.4%. Core price was 4.1%, our highest level in over five years. Average yield was 2.3% and was strongest in our small container and large container businesses. The majority of these customers are in open markets, where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform. In our small container business, average yield was 3.8%, our highest level of pricing in over seven years.","First quarter volumes increased 1%. Volume growth was in line with our expectations and was broad-based across the majority of our markets. Volumes continued to be strong in the event-driven portion of our business, which tends to be a leading indicator for future volume growth. And as expected, residential volumes turned positive as we anniversary the impact of contracts not renewed.","During the quarter, we invested $55 million in tuck-in acquisitions. And we returned $218 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This included 1.8 million shares repurchased for approximately $110 million.","Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, we are now approximately have $425 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index or a fixed-rate increase of 3% or greater for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have historically run higher than CPI.","Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 18% of our fleet now operates on compressed natural gas, 75% of our residential fleet is currently automated and 96% of our total fleet has now been certified under our OneFleet maintenance program. The entire fleet will be certified by the end of the second quarter.","Before turning the call over to Chuck, I would like to congratulate the Republic team for being recognized by Ethisphere as one of the world's most ethical companies. Our commitment to fostering a strong ethical culture, conducting our business with the highest levels of integrity and developing sustainable practices to enhance long-term value creation enabled us to be named to this elite list.","I'll now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our financial results. Chuck?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Don. First quarter revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $144 million or 6.4% over the prior year. This 6.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 6.2% and acquisitions of 20 basis points. The components of internal growth are as follows.","First, average yield increased 2.3%, average yield in the collection business was 2.9%, which includes 3.8% yield in the small container business, 2.8% yield in the large container business and 1.8% yield in the residential business.","Average yield in the post-collection business was 70 basis points, which includes landfill MSW of 1.9%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 4.1%. Core price consisted of 5.5% in the open market and 1.9% in the restricted portion of our business.","The second component of internal growth is total volume, which increased 1% over the prior year. Volumes increased 1.8% in our large container business and 30 basis points in our residential business. As expected, volumes decreased 70 basis points in our small container business. Small container volumes included a 130-basis-point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have increased 60 basis points.","The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 3.5%. Landfill volume increased 2.8%, which included C&D of 17.1% and special waste of 1.1%. MSW volumes were flat versus the prior year. The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees, which increased 40 basis points. The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.57 in the first quarter from $2.08 in the prior year, an increase of 24%. The current average diesel price is $2.50 per gallon. The next component, energy services revenue increased 40 basis points. The growth in energy services revenue is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity.","And the final component of internal growth is commodity revenue, which increased 2.1%. The growth in commodity sales revenue primarily relates to an increase in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 61% to $162 per ton in the first quarter from $101 per ton in the prior year. The current average commodity price is approximately $155 per ton. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased 49% due to an increase in rebates resulting from higher recycled commodity prices.","Now I will discuss changes in margin. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.4%, which compares to 27.8% in the prior year. This change includes a 30-basis-point increase in landfill operating costs, primarily due to temporary costs associated with new operating requirements at one of our landfills. These costs were anticipated and should be completed by the end of the second quarter, and a 20-basis-point margin decline or $0.01 of EPS from heavy rains on the West Coast. In certain markets, we had to close some of our facilities for several days, which resulted in lower volumes and higher transportation and disposal costs. Excluding these temporary cost increases, we had margin expansion in the quarter due to strong pricing and volume growth, which demonstrates the operating leverage in our business. It should be noted that the margin benefit from higher recycled commodity prices was offset by the change in net fuel.","SG&A costs were 10.6% of revenue and in line with our expectations. These costs improved 10 basis points compared to the prior year. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. First quarter 2017 interest expense was $89 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 36.2%, resulting in $0.03 of EPS benefit relative to our expectations. The lower tax rate resulted from tax accounting for equity compensation. We expect to be at an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the reminder of the year. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was $240 million, an increase of 50% versus the prior year. Cash flow can vary quarter-to-quarter based upon the timing of working capital and capital expenditures.","I will now turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. To conclude, strong fundamentals, together with solid operational execution, resulted in 6% top line growth and double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow. As anticipated, the current economic environment continues to be favorable for the business, and we're on track to achieve our full-year goals. We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders.","At this time, operator, we'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from Brian Maguire at Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good afternoon.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Brian.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Nice pickup from the trend you had been on the last couple of quarters up 1%, but it was a little bit lower than some of the peers. I think you talked about some of the business you shed at the small container commercial. I just wondered if you could maybe give us a sense of what the volumes would have been without that, and maybe more of a cleaner number then, and when we would expect to anniversary some of that activity.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, couple of things on that. The first thing is that the weather did have an impact on our MSW volumes coming into our landfill. So, we posted, as I said, flat volume growth on MSW, but if you take into consideration of weather that volume growth would have been closer to 1.4%. So, overall, I think that the impact of weather and maybe some contracts that we shed may have had a 30-basis-point-or-so impact on our overall volume growth.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. And let me add to that. On the small container business specifically, that's just a strategic decision that we've made to not continue to do business with brokers and that broker volume to us that loss is non-regrettable. Our perspective is that brokers don't add any real value to customers. Customers should be doing business with us directly. A strategic decision we've made, and we've been shedding some of that business now for several quarters. We got little ways to go. But otherwise, if you subtract that, to your point, Brian, the underlying economic growth is strong. We're getting good price and getting our fair share growth in the business.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. As a follow-up, the margins were a little bit lower than what we were expecting. It sounds like maybe a little bit lower than what you're expecting too is some of the rains and landfill cost that you had there. Just wondering if you expect any of that to carry through into 2Q or if you think those costs were kind of episodic just to the period.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, the cost that we talked about really related to Q1, especially as it relates to the heavy rains. We're still optimistic of regarding the margin expansion this year. If we look at kind of expectations for the rest of the year, keep in mind that net queue, although there was a headwind for us in Q1 that's going to be a tailwind for us starting in Q2. We do get the step up in CPI as we had talked about that's effective in the second half of the year. And we're going to continue to see benefits from our OneFleet maintenance program, which will be fully rolled out in July 1 of this year. So, we feel optimistic in terms of being able to achieve expansion in EBITDA margins this year.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Feniger at Bank of America.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Yeah. Thanks for...","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hello, Mike.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Mike.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. On the guide for the margin, it's good that you still expect margin expansion, but are we still sticking in that 20 to 40-basis-point range for the year?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, we are. I mean, that's still what we're looking at for this year. Remember, the headwinds, we knew that the margin expansion would be more a back-half loaded just because of the fuel and because of some of the other costs that we're looking at the frontend of the year. And also keep in mind that CPI price increase that we get together with the OneFleet maintenance program, so we knew that it would be back-half loaded. So, right now, Mike, we're right on track.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. We've got these temporary landfill operating costs that Chuck spoke of, look we don't like these weather as an excuse, in general, we don't, but when you got landfills that close for several days at a time and we had a couple facilities in the western part of the U.S. that didn't pull trucks out for five, six days that really does impact your overall operations. So, these are just couple of basis points. We're going to get back to it. And again, these other tailwinds that Chuck described are real, and that's going to come through in the second half.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great. And just to think about the mix of the business, I'm just curious you're seeing energy services up, recycling prices have been higher. Does the profitability on the waste mix, does it start to move more to being margin accretive, and do you expect that to show up in the back half?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, we saw some of that, right, Mike, in the first quarter. Right? So, the extent that we had more revenue coming in from our E&P business and our revenue coming in from commodities, we saw some of that actually in Q1. And you strip away the noise that we had in terms of the landfill operating costs and the heavy rains, you actually saw the margin expansion, partly due, to your point, to the mix of business.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. And right. We're seeing growth now across all lines of business. Right? We saw growth in residential. We saw growth in small container, net of the broker loss, so on and so forth. So, we're seeing a broader based recovery. And again, we're seeing in all geographies. So, the macro is in good shape. The momentum is there in the business.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question is from Hamzah Mazari at Macquarie.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just around how much capacity do you guys have in the current demand environment? What I mean by that is, one of your competitors had said that they began adding routes in many markets in the nation on the commercial side for the first time since their downturn. And you referenced your business is picking up. Just curious how much capacity you have on the ground. Have you been adding routes already? Just if you could frame that for us, where you guys are at.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","We have added some routes, Hamzah, in the few markets. Some markets have little more capacity than others, because they were impacted more deeply by the downturn, but I think it's a mix bag. We're also very, very focused on compliance of hours of service and all those other areas of the business. So, we're employing new route tools as well, and getting more precise in and around our really route standard. So, we're going to continue to pickup productivity in the business while we're also expanding the business. So, there's no one answer that fits every market. Everyone is kind of in a different state on the continuum. But I wouldn't say that we're at capacity across the board. And as you know, small container business that the new stuffs soaking pretty easily so to speak in that business. And that's one of the reasons our tuck-in strategy work so well, because we can very often buy a four, five truck company and take trucks off the street. So that alone speaks to the fact that we've got capacity in the system.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Right. And then you had referenced brokers, do you have a sense of how big brokers are as a percent of the market and has that gone down over time or is that going up? I know Waste Management had bought Oakleaf and that wasn't the great deal, but just a sense of how big is the market for brokers. And clearly, you have some non-regrettable losses that you're still working through and that's strategic and I understand that, but just trying to get a sense of the brokerage business. Thank you.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","So, I don't think brokers are playing a bigger role in the business. When Oakleaf was sold to Waste Management, we said, hey, someone is going to fill that vacuum, somebody always does. Our position again is that brokers don't really offer any real value or advantage to customers. We believe we should be owning that customer interface directly with all of our capabilities, the breadth of our products and all of our digital tools, the customers will be better served dealing directly with us and not through a broker.","So that's the decision we made, we're going to maintain it. We don't see the business going other way or the trends going the other way. Frankly at the same time, we're improving our capabilities for customers around sustainability, around filling their needs about being selling them solutions that they need, giving them the reporting they need. So, some of the things that brokers used to sell above and beyond are things that we can all do ourselves now, and we're not done yet, right. So, our products continue to improve. Our product catalog continues to expand. And so, little by little we think there's less and less need for brokers in the business and the market, and we think that's frankly the trend.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you, Don.","Operator","Next question is from Al Kaschalk at Wedbush Securities.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Al.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Al.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","And Nicole.","Nicole Giandinoto (Koziol) - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Al.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","A little more color on the operating landfill cost. I think it was a 30-basis-point headwind. Is that includes 20 basis points from the heavy rains or is there something else that maybe you can help just articulate further what that occurred in the quarter?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, there is 30 basis points associated with the landfill operating costs. And then, an additional 20 basis points associated with the heavy rains. So, the landfill operating costs really relate to one landfill, and it has to do with intermediate cover and some other enhancements that we're making to start an operating process at that landfill.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","And some of those costs we just kind of pulled forward into Q1 from later parts in the year where they were budgeted.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Is this the Midwest landfill?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","No. It's not. This is actually a landfill in California.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Well, there is a Midwest in the California too. Anyhow, secondly, and this is more, I guess, you have concentrated or invested where you're able to get returns, and it's related to recycling. I think overall, you say there is about a $0.03, $0.04 headwind for a $10-change. You got commodities that have come down here sharply. I guess my point is, I'm just trying to ask from a business and operating prospective, is that the right \u2013 your commitment to that business and the impact it has on your operations, correct, as I thought it also had further impact, greater impact one way or the other based on the dollar change (23:56). So, in other words, the contract changes you may have made or processing fees of \u2013 are those revisions showing up, and that's why maybe there wasn't as much leverage in the model in the quarter, based on...","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, we've updated the market on the sensitivity as it's changed. It used to be greater than it is, right. So that sensitivity has decreased. Our focus on the business remains. In other words, we've continued to migrate our agreements with customers who deliver material to our facilities in a more fair sort of cost sharing arrangement. So, a good portion of those contracts have already been converted.","We're working with municipalities to convert the collection portion of contracts to more \u2013 again, a fair cost sharing arrangements, that work is going to continue. And we're going to continue to invest in the recycle business, to your point Al, where it makes sense with the right terms and an equitable contract. And meanwhile, we've still shuttered MRFs at our recycling facilities that didn't return an adequate return on capital, so that's all going to continue.","So, we still think it's a good business, where we have good partners, specifically municipal partners who want to be forward-thinking in their sustainability plans, but as you heard me say, you can't have sustainability without profitability. So that's our view. And we think as we continue to work toward fair sharing arrangements that the volatility and the exposure will continue to come down.","Having said that, we will also probably be giving up a little bit of the upside along the way, but we will have insulated the business from the volatile downturn. So that's still the right way to run the business we think, but it's going to just happen one step at a time.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. And we're still early on in the process, Al. We've got about 50% of our processing contracts currently converted over to this processing fee, but the majority of the material that we handle right now, we actually collect on behalf of municipalities, those are covered under longer term contracts. So, it's going to take us a little while longer to cycle through those contracts. But we'll continue to keep you updated in terms of the changes and the sensitivity analysis that we do relative to the price of commodities.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. And as it relates to the overall price of commodities now, they started out strong at the beginning of the year, they came down in the end of March and now April, but we think frankly they're, for the long-term, for the full year they're still going to be at or slightly above the rate that we guided to.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. And that rate is what?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","$140 per ton.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. And finally just to clean-up, how many cents were benefiting the quarter from recycling?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","So, recycling was actually a $0.01 benefit during the quarter, but at the same time, we had a $0.01 negative associated with fuel, with net fuel. So, if you remember last year, we called out a lag benefit that we received in Q1. So, year-over-year there's actually a $0.01 benefit from fuel. So those two kind of net out.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Right. Thanks a lot guys, and good luck.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Al.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Al.","Operator","The next question is from Sean Egan at KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good evening, everyone.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Sean.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Sean.","Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I just wanted to touch on OneFleet. Now that you guys are almost completely rolled out, can you help us understand maybe what proportion of the benefits that you've seen from the program either through the P&L or the cash flow statement? Just trying to understand the tail after you are fully implemented, if we continue to see benefits for another 6, 12 months as the program matures or if we're kind of through our total savings.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, I'll start out by just emphatically saying that we haven't seen all the benefits from OneFleet yet. Okay. So, let's talk OneFleet from a couple different views. The first being CapEx, one of the benefits of OneFleet is to extend the useful life of the fleet, which means aging the fleet a year, which is a onetime $200 million savings, we're about halfway through that. We'll save yet another $200 million from what we've saved so far, so that'll happen this year.","And then there's an ongoing tail, in other words, if you maintain your fleet to now an older age indefinitely, there is a $20 million, $25 million a year savings every year from doing that. So, that's the gift that keeps on giving with OneFleet. That's on the CapEx side. But that's real cash, that's happening, we're seeing that.","On the operating side, the goal of OneFleet, right, is to maintain the fleet to be the most safe and efficient reliable fleets you can have. That doesn't mean the youngest fleet, right, it means, maintaining these trucks to high standard throughout their life. So, in the divisions, the business units that have had OneFleet in place the longest, they've seen the greatest benefit in their operating metrics. Fleet availability, engine hour cost and all the other things that we measured, the handful of key metrics we measured in OneFleet.","Every one of our divisions has a maintenance dashboard where they follow and closely track their metrics related to OneFleet and our maintenance staff here at the headquarters works with them directly to put extra emphasis on those divisions that need additional health and support. So, we know the things are working. We know the divisions that I've been on the longest have had the best results and the divisions that I just put on last year who're still in the certification process are still working through some of the bumps. So, this is a big, big undertaking. We're still very convinced, it was the right thing to do, and we're seeing the benefits.","And now, we're going to really work hard to find an efficient frontier of our fleet, and we're going to start seeing other benefits from having the most reliable fleet in the industry. That's going to start showing up in areas like drive a morale and turnover. In fact, our driver turnover is found year-over-year. Our employee engagement score is up year-over-year. All these other metrics that we measure point positively to some of the things, some of the underlying fundamental things we're doing. So, I could go on and on about OneFleet, but I won't because we only have an hour. So, we're glad we did it. We're almost through the certification process. And then, we'll have some time and capacity to tackle another initiative to be the inflator.","Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you for all that. And then secondly, I know you alluded to the conversions or the progress that you've made on conversions to a mega water sewer trash index or an alternate to CPI. Can you maybe help us understand the split between collection and disposal within those contracts and maybe kind of give your comments a little towards the disposal side?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, I would tell you most of that is collection, right. But, as you know, we don't have a great deal of third-party competitive volume at our landfills, because have consistently raised prices on MSW at our landfill and a lot of that other volume has sort of found other homes. But most of the MSW volume at our landfills that's not coming in on our own trucks, comes from municipalities, and to your point, those volumes are tied to some kind of a CPI escalator. But we are working those just like we're working the other collection contracts, moving to an index that makes sense.","And so, I'll say this, most of the more recent conversions have been with the water sewer trash, and\/or fixed via 3% to 4%, because we think that's fair and equitable, and we've still been able to sell that to customers as fair and equitable, and we continue to make progress, and we're not giving up. Even though CPI is improving, to Chuck's point earlier, we're going to start to see some benefit from an improved CPI environment, certainly come through at the end of the year. We're going to continue to push to an index that makes sense. And meanwhile, we'll take advantage of an improving CPI environment if that continues for us as well. So, it's a best of all for us.","Sean J. Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Hoffman at Stifel.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Nicole, John and Chuck for taking my call.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Michael.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Michael.","Nicole Giandinoto (Koziol) - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Michael.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","How are you? Let's talk about cash flow. And sort of how do you get from here to there to $900 million, you've got heck of a start, but help us walk through the flows, if you will, to the remainder of the year, given the conditions in recycling E&P and the seasonal trends that could or couldn't happen. How does that all play out to get to the $900 million?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, like you said, Michael, I think that we're already off to a very good start. And some of that has to do with the timing of CapEx. That can be a little bit lumpy. But we're seeing very strong operating results, obviously we've got very strong EBITDA and that's manifesting itself in our free cash flow. So, we feel very confident with our guidance that we gave relative to our cash flow for the year.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. How are you going to get there? Talk to me about how do you get there.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","I think it's execution with the rest of our plan, right, Michael. So, we said that we would get double-digit growth in earnings, EPS, this year and in free cash flow. And we demonstrated in Q1. We've actually got that in Q1. And so, it's continuing the blocking and tackling. And also it's the tailwinds that I had talked about, right. So, it's the net fuel, it's the CPI, it's the OneFleet, it's all of those coming together, and that's going to produce the cash flow for the year. And like I said, we're confident right now that we're going to be able to hit our guidance.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, Michael, this is Don. You've been around a long time. I mean, that is a complement. You know that it's never about one quarter. And this frankly is a very good quarter. This quarter is right on top of our operating plan, it's right on top the guidance we provided. We've got a lot of momentum in the business. We talk about the best pricing in years, it's not just this quarter that started at the end of last year. We talked about the momentum in volume, shifting deposit volume in all lines of business. That's a trend, it's not just a quarter.","We talk about the fact that we're still only at a 1.2 million household starts, and we still haven't hit sort of the 25 to 50-year average. So, there's still growth to come in that business. And we had a couple of things that touches in Q1, a couple of things we didn't expect. So, we make some decisions ourselves to pull some cost forward. That's just running the business, because we don't run the business just for the quarter, and you know that, right. So, we've got ongoing strength in pricing. We've got a great sales force that's pulling their way, and we're getting our fair share of growth. And we're using our pricing tools to get the best customers at the best price. Price per unit for new sales is up. All those things are going to continue, right.","We've got improving metrics in areas like safety and turnover and NPS. And of the gazillion metrics that we track many of them are moving in the right direction, right, but it's a game of inches. So, we're going to continue to do those things. We've got as Chuck said, these tailwinds. We've got the net fuel flipping in our favor in the second half. We got CPI coming back. We've got some of these other, what we call, temporary costs of sighting. That's how we get there. It's just good old fashion execution, getting our fair share of the growth, getting better around service delivery, getting better around customer acquisition, getting better around safety and we're going to continue investing in the business.","We're not going to get there by taking the CapEx holiday. We're not going to get there by not covering our landfills. We're not going to get there by taking shortcuts. We're going to get there by running the business for the long-term, making the business better and better, and all those things are well on their way. So, we expect to have a solid Q2 and a solid year. We've said, look, we're reaffirming our guidance. And we expect that we're going to achieve toward the higher end of the EPS guidance. And I think there's a lot of confidence in that statement.","So, what else do you want to know?","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, when I look at it in the data you give us, so you gave us cash flow from ops ranges and then you subtract out your PP&E received plus divestitures. There is a pretty healthy ramp and to get the cash flow from ops number to get to the $900 million. And that has to come with operating leverage. I mean, there's no other way to make that up. I mean, there's not monster working capital savings. So, I think what I was getting after is that, if I get the seasonal trend normal, nothing unusual 2Q, 3Q. Given what you've done with your cost, I should see something in and around $1.86 billion in cash flow from ops. You spend what you're going to spend. There's your $900 million.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Right, Michael. And just come back down to the operating leverage that you had talked about. That's what's going to drive the free cash flow, that's what's going to drive the margin expansion. Absolutely. That's baked into the numbers and that's what was baked into our guidance.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","But it's not \u2013 you're not doing this through working capital. This is operating leverage to the income statement, I managed to pick a negative working capital and turn it into a source.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","That's exactly right.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. We're not taking shortcuts. There's no smoke and mirrors. It's good old fashion run of the business. You got all these benefits of these initiatives layering in, you got the momentum builds. Again, every new unit, every new ton comes in at a higher margin. You got to arrest a few cost along the way. You got to hit your productivity goals, which we have set for the team. Everybody has goals in the organization, right. So all that has to happen, but that should be a phase to do and that's what we see happening in Q1, net of a couple of anomalies and a couple things that we kind of do our-self here. But as I said, the momentum is there, we're reaffirming the guidance, it's really good quarter here. But we don't have our feet up on the table celebrating, as soon as we hang up the phone, we're going to go right back to work.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. So, on the landfill side, if my memory serves, a disproportionate amount of your landfill comes on your truck, you don't take that much third-party.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, we take third-party but most of our third-party is MSW tied to municipal, which is price restricted. Right. So...","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","In that third-party, what was the trend there on the year-over-year volume?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, are you talking about on the MSW coming in third-party?","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. The MSW was kind of flattish, but then you look at the C&D was very, very strong with 17.1% as I had mentioned. And that's coming off of a 17.8% last year. So, very strong on the advent pieces that were coming into the landfill.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, what I'm trying to get out a little bit is, you had good frontend loader growth volume wise in your own business, but your third-party MSW, which is really residential side loaders, but it's MSW. So it's still the consumer is flat, I'm trying to reconcile that. How many will live with that?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. You keep in mind that those MSW volumes that we had talked about were impacted by the weather. And if you strip that weather out, they were closer to an increase of 1.4%.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","But still it's not monster growth, it's not 5%, 6%. So, we generally feel that landfill growth should be fairly consistent, third-party landfill growth should be fairly consistent with the growth that we have in our core hauling business. They tend to flow with each other. And that's our view of the world. Now, the only thing that sort of changes that is, when we're reporting price volume in aggregate, it really is a revenue calculation, right? And so, we get \u2013 there's only a little bit of noise when you compare the two based on container weights or a container is 100% full and those kind of things, because as you know as people continue to provide or want more service increases, it takes a while before you actually can convert that to revenue, so there's some of that noise in the system. But we still think it's, on a macro basis, a very broad based recovery. It's not spiking. It's not happening in any big way. It's just happening a little at a time.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. I think the recovery is very metered, because that's the nature of the housing recovery.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And what I was trying to get a feel for is, are you seeing a commercial business growth that's a combination of housing driving new business and your existing group business, walking up service intervals. And a corollary to that would be, it's the consumer everywhere. And so, your third-party volume into your landfill, all those numbers, there is a relationship to them.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think all of those things are very well balanced and consistent with what we've seen in our business, in our markets, in our collection of assets, historically. At least over the last several quarters, as we've seen a more pronounced recovery from the dark days we've seen in the past. So, I think it's very correlated.","Again, other companies that may report may have a different set of assets. Some companies have a bigger landfill concentration. Some companies have businesses north of the border. Some companies have landfills in markets where they're not particularly integrated. We don't have any of that, right. So, we're more of a vertically integrated business across 240 markets. So, our business behaves a certain way. But there's nothing we're seeing in the trend, in the macro that has us worried. We think there's more to come. We think you look at our positive trends in price and volume, they're not just the quarter, but they're sequential, and the same thing is happening within the business. When I talk about operating metrics we track there, they're improving, right.","And we're only doing $100 million of tuck-in a year. So, we're not spending $300 million, $400 million, $500 million, $1 billion on acquisitions. So, we look a little different, right. But the business is performing well. And we're talking double-digit free cash flow growth and double-digit EPS growth, Michael. And that's frankly something we hadn't seen in number of years. So, I would say, strong performance for these assets. And again as I said, more to come, because the trends are and the momentum is in the business.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","You bet.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","See you Tuesday.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","The next question is from Corey Greendale, First Analysis.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Hey, good afternoon.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Corey.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Corey.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Hey. So, just a couple questions. And apologies if this is treading back over some things you touched on a little bit already, but just to sort of set future expectations. Don, you mentioned on the broker business there's still some more to go. Can you just give us a sense how much of your revenue now consists of work you're doing for brokers?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. I don't know if we've given you the exact number, but I think we'll be through it probably sometime next year. Okay? It'll sort of trickle its way out between now and the end of next year.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Okay. And then on the volume point, I totally get different mixes and I understand the weather impact, but I think just to put a finer point on one thing, I think one question we're going to be getting is just sort of the comp between your MSW volume growth and Waste's MSW growth. And I realize you can't really address specifically other companies, but any thoughts on why, because presumably they would have been hit by weather also, why the delta between the kind of flattish for you and the 7%-ish that they got?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. One thing I would point out is that, we're coming off a very hard comp on the MSW side of 4.7%. And I'm not sure what they reported last year, what kind of comp they're coming off of. So that might have something to do with it.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Okay. I don't recall. I'll check.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. And again, we're not paying as much attention to what they're saying as what we're doing. So...","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Yeah. No, I totally get it. And you're running your own business and the business is going well, just in terms of \u2013 I think it's a question people looking at both companies will ask. Last question I had is just, Chuck, as far as on the cost side, one thing that \u2013 not to overemphasize 30 basis points, but the increase in the labor under SG&A was a little higher than I expected. I think it was up about 11% year-over-year. Is that the trend we should expect for the rest of the year?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","No, that really has to do with our customer resource centers that we're in the process of opening. That'll be done by the end of this year. So, our expectation is that salaries will come down as a percentage of revenue for the rest of the year.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Because of cost savings or you're saying there's some implementation costs you're incurring now.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. That's right, Corey. It's an implementation cost. That's exactly right.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Think about duplicate staffing levels and having to employ more people in the overlap and all the rest of it.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Got it. And remind me when should we start to see the savings coming in?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","So, it's next year is what we had said that you'll see a full run rate of savings associated with the CRCs.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","At the beginning of 2018?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Starting in the beginning of 2018.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Perfect. All right. Thanks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question is from Noah Kaye at Oppenheimer.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, Don, Chuck and Nicole. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe if we could start with the dynamic around core price versus average yield. Suddenly when you've got both numbers moving in a positive direction, it sets a strong start. But if I look at the gap between core price and average yield, which is a metric that you talked to, it did increase somewhat in the quarter since you're getting 4.1% price. I think that delta was about 1.8%, I guess. Do we make of this that some of your recent initiatives around pricing and price capture are starting to take stronger route? And how do we think about the stickiness of some of the core price increases?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, let me just address the churn a little bit. So, we saw a slight increase in the churn sequentially, and that really had to do with a supplemental revenue imitative that we had in place in 2016 that we ended up anniversarying. And we knew that that was coming. And that's why we were very focused in on going out with additional pricing actions, which help push our yield up over the 2% level. So, that might be some of what you're seeing right now. And certainly that's what you're seeing in terms of the core price that we've been able to push out in the open market.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Right. To your point, the tools are fully deployed, the adoption rate is high, people are using the tools. Our selling rate for new sales is up. So, we're selling new business on a per unit basis at a higher rate this year than we were last year. The tools are designed to do that. Customer retention stay strong at 93%. So, all those other metrics are good shape. And again it sometimes the benefits of these things showed slowly, but they continue to provide benefit and they'll continue that through the year.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then there's been a lot of discussion of the different components of volume. I guess if we just backup, thus far, we've seen normal seasonality in the second quarter.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Second quarter, means, it seems fine to us. Really we usually wait to really talk about seasonality until the quarter's completed, because it's really May-June where that really comes to roost, probably a little bit too early to tell. The frost is \u2013 there's still chance of frost in the Midwest kind of thing. And I know that because I'm doing a little construction project there and they keep complaining that there might be frost in the ground that's why they can't get things done. So, anyways, we get to the seasonality question through sort of mid-May and into June, and we'll give you an update on the Q2 call.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks. And then maybe if I could just finish up and try to get at this MSW versus C&D maybe from a slightly different angle. If you have double-digit increases in C&D, and as you've always framed this, housing starts and construction, should presage over time an increase in the higher margin MSW type volumes. Do you think that you just have some footprints in relatively younger markets or higher growth markets, and that is going to take a bit more time for those MSW growth rates to catch up. Could that be a possibility?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, I don't know that we slice it quite that finally. We talk about the various types of markets we're in. It's a pretty good balance of urban centers and secondary markets, and 25% of our business is in franchise market. So, it's pretty balanced portfolio. So, we don't spend a lot of time analyzing that, because I don't think it really does us a lot of good help from the business. So, I'm sorry, I can't provide you the insight.","Overall, we look more, market-by-market, how we make investments, how we deploy sales force and products, and how all of our markets contributing. And the good news to that answer is, all the markets are really doing pretty well. We get a really broad-based recovery here. It really is, as I've shared talking about with Michael Hoffman, I think it's taking a lot longer for us to see the benefit of small container growth in this recovery.","We had hoped and thought we would see it sooner than we did, but we've been seeing it. And net of this broker issue we're working through, we've got decent growth there too. So, when all lines of businesses are contributing, including your higher margin, things start to make a difference for you on the margin and that's what we're going to begin to see here now in the second half of the year.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Right. Thanks very much for the color and see you at WasteExpo.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Noah.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Tyler Brown at Raymond James.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Tyler.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Tyler.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, Chuck. Just to be clear, so the landfill operating cost headwinds, they sunset at the end of Q2?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. That's right.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then, was the lack of the CNG tax credit a notable drag?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","It was a drag. That's part of that drag that we called out that $0.01 of EPS, about 50 basis points at that, that was all part of it.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","But the big piece of it was the fuel like that, the benefit that we received last year for it.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And so, my last question here is, just, if CPI is set to help us here in the back half, I mean, it seems that the open market is very rational. It seems like churn is lower stable. Why wouldn't yields be better than the 2%, 3% here in the back half?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, we're not there yet, right? Historically, when CPI is nor normal or in that sort of 2%, 3% range, open market pricing is better, historically. So, we're certainly thinking about how we will go to market and will think about what the market bears and allows, and will be evaluating competitive behavior and all the rest of it. It's too early to tell, but historically, yes CPI is up, open market pricing is up as well. So, we'll just see what happens.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","And we'll update our guidance as we always do in July.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Sure. Okay. All right. It's been a long day. Thanks.","Donald W.

Republic Services is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, RSG. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian DelGhiaccio, Senior Vice President of Finance.","Brian DelGhiaccio","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.

I want to point out that our SEC filings, our earnings press release which includes GAAP reconciliation tables and a discussion of business activities, along with the recording of this call, are all available on Republic's website at republicservices.com.","And finally, I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.","Don Slager","Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We're pleased with our second quarter results which were in line with our expectations and keep us well-positioned to achieve our full-year financial guidance. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of probable growth through differentiation which allows us to attract and retain high-value customers, build the best team, increase profitability and create long term value.","During the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.55. EPS improved from the prior year, even with a $0.02 increase in the effective tax rate. Excluding the increases in taxes, EPS grew approximately 6%. Adjusted free cash flow grew 5% to $177 million and was in line with our expectations.","Core price was 3.1% and average yield was 2%. We expect the average yield to remain relatively consistent with our second quarter performance for the remainder of the year. We continue to see the highest level of average yield in our small container commercial business. The majority of these customers are on open markets, where we can a leverage an increase in demand for service our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform.","Second quarter volumes grew increased -- second quarter volumes increased50 basis points. As expected, volume growth moderated from the first quarter but remain positive. We continue to expect volume growth of approximately 1% for the year, consistent with our guidance. Cost of operations improved 20 basis points to 61.3% of revenue, from 61.5% in the prior year.","There was a sequential improvement in most cost categories, including labor, maintenance and landfill operating costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin was consistent with the prior year at 28.3% of revenue. We incurred approximately $5 million of legal settlement costs during the quarter which impacted EBITDA margin by 20 basis points and reduced EPS by approximately $0.01.","We saw EBITDA margin improvement in all lines of business, with the exception of residential. Pricing in the residential business continues to be impacted by below CPI environment. We launched and priced a tender transaction and new debt issuance which will reduce annual interest cost by $17 million or approximately $0.03 of EPS. These deals closed in early July. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $400 million total cash to our shareholders, since the beginning of the year. This includes 4.2 million shares repurchased for $194 million. Additionally, our Board recently raised the quarterly dividend by approximately 7%. The annualized dividend is now $1.28 per share.","Regarding our revenue enhancing and customer-facing initiatives, first, we now have approximately $340 million in annual revenue that uses a Waste Related Index for the annual price adjustment. These Waste Indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have consistently run higher than CPI.","Additionally, we move $25 million annual revenue to a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. We made these changes for customers that want more certainty around future rate increases and we're confident that we can manage our cost structure at or below this level. Second, approximately 1.6 million customers are enrolled in our customer portal and mobile app, up 60% from the prior year. These tools significantly enhance our customer interaction and connectivity. Third, our eCommerce platform now has the capability for customers to purchase temporary large container and residential subscription services online. This addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower cost sales channel. Approximately 15% of residential subscription sales are coming through our eCommerce platform.","And finally, we opened our second Customer Resource Center located in Phoenix. We expect to open our last Customer Resource Center in Indianapolis later this year. Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives 17% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas; 73% of our residential fleet is currently automated; and 85% of our total fleet has been certified under our OneFleet Standardized Maintenance Program, up from 70% a year ago.","We recently completed the final wave of our OneFleet implementations and expect the entire fleet will be certified by mid-2017. Recent recycled commodity prices have trended above the prior year by approximately $5 to $10 per ton. If prices remain at these levels for the balance of the year, we would expect to achieve the higher end of our EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges.","When assessing other macro conditions, we continue to see a gradual improvement in the fundamentals that impact our business which was the premise for our 2016 business plan. Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?","Chuck Serianni","Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $39 million or 1.7% over the prior year. This 1.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1.3% and acquisitions of 40 basis points. The components of internal growth are as follows, first, total average yield growth of 2%; average yield in the collection business was 2.3% which includes 3.7% yield in the small container business ; 1.9% yield in the large container business; and 1.2% yield in the residential business.","Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.1% which includes landfill MSW of 1.6%, a majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts that contain pricing restrictions. Total core price which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.1%. Core price consisted of 4.1% in the open market and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business.","Second, our total volumes increased 50 basis points which was in line with our expectations. Volume growth moderated during the second quarter, mostly due to the mild winter conditions which favorably impacted our first quarter performance. Volumes in the collections business increased 30 basis points which included 2.9% increase from the large container business, a 10 basis point decline from the small container business and a 1.4% decline from the residential business. Within our large container business, temporary C&D hauls were up 6.5% and recurring hauls were up 2.1%. Temporary C&D hauls remain strong and continue to reflect an increase in construction-related activity. There was a 50 basis point impact to small container volume from not renewing select national accounts customers and shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable.","Our residential volume decline of 1.4% was due to not renewing certain contracts that did not meet our return criteria. These losses were known and contemplated in our full-year volume guidance. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 1.5%. Landfill volume increased 1.6% which consisted of MSW volume growth of 2.2% and C&D of 13.8%, partially offset by decline in landfill special waste of 1.1%. The decline in special waste relates to large event-driven volumes in the prior dear year that did not repeat. Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 1%. The change primarily relates to the decline in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased $2.30 in the second quarter from $2.85 in the prior year, a decrease of 19%.","The current average diesel price is $2.38 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.","Next, energy services revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in energy services revenue primarily relates to a year-over-year decrease in drilling activity, resulting from a decline in the price of oil.","Finally, commodity revenue increased 30 basis points. The increase in commodity revenue primarily relates to an increase in processing fees charged to third parties. This increase results from our initiative to transition to fee-based recycling model. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 3% to $116 per ton in the second quarter, from $113 per ton in the prior year. Second quarter total recycling volume of 648,000 tons was consistent with the prior year. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities was flat versus prior year.","Now I will discuss changes in margin. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3% and consistent with the prior year. Total cost of operations decreased to 61.3% from 61.5% in the prior year, resulting in 20 basis points of margin expansion. Sequentially, the year-over-year change in labor improved 30 basis points and maintenance improved 40 basis points. We expect maintenance expense, as a percentage of revenue, will be below prior-year levels as we exit the year.","SG&A expenses were 10.4% of revenue compared to 10.2% in the prior year. The 20 basis point increase was due to settling certain legal matters from prior years. On a full-year basis, we expect SG&A expenses of 10.5% of revenue which represents a 30-basis point improvement from 2015. When looking at the detailed cost line items, as a percentage of revenue, there is an impact from the decrease in fuel recovery fees. For example, the 1% decline in fuel recovery fee revenue resulted in an increase in labor expense of 20 basis points and repairs and maintenance expense of 10 basis points.","I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Second quarter 2016 interest expense was $92 million which included $12 million of non-cash amortization. As Don mentioned, we recently completed several financing transactions. First, we refinanced our $1 billion credit facility that was maturing in May of 2017. Second, we tendered $575 million of debt with coupons ranging from 5.7% to 7.4%. And finally, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes with a 2.9% coupon.","As a result of these transactions, we expect to save approximately $17 million in annual interest expense or approximately $0.03 of EPS. Our effective tax rate was approximately 38%. The lower tax rate in the second quarter resulted in a $0.01 EPS benefit from settling of federal tax matter.","We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $177 million and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $337 million. Both were in line with our expectations. We expect free cash flow generation will be weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of capital expenditures and working capital. We remain comfortable with our full-year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $820 million to, $840 million.","Now I will turn the call back over to Don.","Don Slager","Thanks, Chuck. To conclude, our second quarter results were consistent with our expectations and they keep us on track to achieve our full-year guidance. I'm proud of how the Republic team continued to execute our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation.","And our performance continues to reflect our hard work. We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders, including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. At this time in the call, I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tyler Brown","Core pricing did decelerate a little bit but yield has held steady. I think the spread between the two is about as small as we've seen in some time. I know one of your competitors has talked about must improved churn. I'm just curious if you're experiencing the same and can you talk a little bit about how PBS and Capture might be helping out there?","Chuck Serianni","Certainly, what we're seeing here is a benefit from PBS and from Capture and that's what's allowed us to decrease our churn by about 30 basis points sequentially. The other thing that we have in here, Tyler is the fact that we're very much focused on ensuring that we're charging for all the services that we performed and that would include things like delivery fees and extra pick-ups. So that's really the focus that we have placed on these new tools and charging for the services has really allowed us to drive down that churn.","Don Slager","Tyler this is Don. As you know PBS is fully rolled out. Capture has now been rolled out for some time. The adoption rates, utilization rates of those tools are very high. We've got great training programs in place to re-trained new hires. It's been really a great success for us. There is a lot of pull in the organization for those tools, professionalizing the sales team. As a backdrop to what Chuck said, defection has remained low at 7% and now we've had that low for a long time. Churn is improving, as Chuck said.","The underlying fundamentals of small container business are strong. So just all around, a good steady business and really good execution by the sales organization. And year over year, another stat we like to look at cost or price of new sales compared to price of new sales from last year is also up and that's, again due to the new tools that we've got out there.","Tyler Brown","Chuck, this is a bigger picture question, but margins have been hanging around this 28% range for, I'd say, the past couple of years. I know publicly, you guys have talked about that there is really nothing structurally that precludes you from getting back to, say, that 30% margin profile.","I know there's lots of internal initiatives but what are the real key levers to getting back to that range? Is it really about bending the cost curve or do you guys need some exogenous help from, say, CPI commodities? Is that what's going to help you get there?","Chuck Serianni","I think when we think about it longer term, we will need to be successful in terms of switching our customers from CPI to some other pricing index which we're very much focused in on. Obviously, a little bit of a tailwind from commodity pricing would help us also. But we're beginning to see margin expansion, right? So we had gross margin expansion during the quarter, 20 basis points, as I mentioned. The other thing is that we still feel comfortable saying that we're going to have gross -- our EBITDA margin expansion during the year.","Part of that is going to come from just our continuing -- continual focus on cost, including maintenance and labor and also we're going to get a little bit of a benefit from the reversal of the workday. So we feel really good about the progress that we're making this year in terms of the cost side of the equation and we feel good about being able to get back to those 30% margins.","Don Slager","Remember, last time, we were north of 30% Tyler and given the size 31ish, we had better recycling commodity prices. We did not have the CPI environments. Those are two important macro things that you pointed out. But we're now seeing benefits coming through the P&L from the OneFleet initiative that is fully rolled out, as I said. We'll certify everybody by this time next year; that's starting to pay dividends.","We will see the benefit start to happen next year in 2018 from the benefit of the reorg net of the CRC consolidations. Those start to roll in. Those are, I think, costs that will easily be able to achieve, based on what we have seen so far so there's a lot of good things in the works and again, there's always that next wave of initiatives that we haven't talked about yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye","Maybe we just start with the recycling part of the business? First of all, can you just remind us how far you are through that process of reworking the contracts? And how long you think that will take? And I think there's second part of that question be it -- I think recently, in particular, you put in place some pretty state-of-the-art automation on some of the recycling facilities. To what extent are you seeing that in a higher automation level helping you on the margin profile and helping the economics along? Thanks.","Don Slager","So let me start by just reminding everybody that the recycling business really is unique based on individual markets. So while on one hand, we continue to make strong investments in recycling. And we're very much committed to helping our customers do the right thing for the planet and to meet their sustainability goals. That only works for us in markets where customers are willing to pay for the service and where we've got a density and participation to make it work. So I say very often, that sustainability doesn't work without profitability and those are a couple of key issues.","Customers really need to value it and we need to have density and participation to make it work. So while we made some great state-of-the-art investments, as you pointed out. We have won some awards, frankly, for some of our innovation in and around recycling. At the same time, we've also had to close some low-volume facilities that were antiquated and where we don't have enough participation to make recycling work. It can't work as a loss leader. So how far are we in the process of really reinventing or reimagining recycling? Again you think about our business being only about 10% of revenues in recycling. It's, again, you think about our business being only about 10% of revenues in recycling.","One of the most volatile parts of our business has been as we just spoke to Tyler about the commodity pricing environment. While it's starting to move up a little bit. It started out very low in the year. Maybe it's going to come back even stronger in the second half, we will have to see. But two components of recycling, one, is processing where we take in material to our facilities from third parties and then one is collection.","On the processing side, about 40% of the volume we take in on processing we've adjusted or have favorable terms so where those customers who actually share in the risk and the upside of the material and the market prices. So those are good contracts. The remaining 18% of those customers in the processing side of our business are -- the remaining customer are going to come due for renegotiation over the 18 months.","So over the next 18 months, we will negotiate to get to fairer terms there. And then on the collection side, that really resides primarily in our residential municipal business and we're working with our municipal partners to help understand this issue and we're renegotiating contracts as we go through time. Those contracts tend to be longer term so I would say we're just still very in early -- in the very early innings with that. But most of the -- that dialogue is met with practical solutions and people understand that it's got to work for both sides of the partnership so we're just going to continue to work through it and continue to invest where it makes sense.","Noah Kaye","I'd like to ask you a question on the relationship between increasing customer profitability and some of the technology initiatives that you're adopting and you mentioned that you've seen good progress on customer churn continuing to trend lower. I would also think with some of the early events that telematics and raw optimization technologies that you've got; it's becoming easier to pinpoint the types of accounts that will improve raw density and integrate profitability so to what extent should we continue to expect that to be a tailwind for you, as basically a secular technology benefit?","Don Slager","Well, just to be clear, we have been using route-based tech -- computer-based technology for routing for a long time, right? GPS-type systems and geocoding, that's not new technology for us. We will continue to improve the utilization of those systems but that's not going to be a big lever for us to pull.","We're going to just get incrementally better year-on-year and continue to improve as the tools improved. But we've been using those tools for a long time so I don't want to leave you the impression that our routes aren't highly efficient or densely routed because that's one of the reasons our margins are 28% because the density model of our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Buscaglia","Can you just talk about -- I thought your topline was a little bit -- just a touch less than I was expecting and if you break it down, it looks like I think expectations might have been a little bit high from Q1 with -- on the volume side but they were pretty much in line, although there were some interesting puts and takes when you start breaking down the volume. Can you just talk about each or the ones that -- highlight the ones that met your expectations or maybe were a little bit lighter? I know there's a lot going on with comps and --","Don Slager","Yes, we'll tag team this. Let's start off by setting the context, right? We had a pretty strong volume growth rate in Q1 but we reminded everybody that, that was just kind of a strange comp year over year. We had a very mild winter compared with a very tough winter the year before and we said to everybody that, look, our guidance for volume has been for the year was 0.5% to 1%. And we're saying now that our volume growth is going to be about 1%, right? So it really is in line in total and -- as far as an exit speed this year, with what we expected, frankly, maybe even to the high end of that.","Chuck Serianni","What I would add to that also is that we did see, as I mentioned before, we did see a step-down in residential volumes and that's because of certain contracts that we did not renew because they didn't meet our return criteria so keep that in mind also. The other thing is that you've got a 50 basis point sequential decline in volume, just due to the additional work day so that's obviously something that's driving the topline in a pretty significant manner. But as Don mentioned, we still remain comfortable with our guidance of hitting about 1% for the year in volume guidance which, as you mentioned, is that the upper end of our original guidance range.","Don Slager","So obviously, a lot of this recovery has been led by our C&D business which continues to perform for us. We mentioned that churn rates are good. We mentioned, I think, defections stayed low. We're seeing container weights increase slightly. We're seeing service increases versus decreases continue to be incrementally favorable.","So all those underlying things that point to -- continue to strengthen and fundamentals are there and we're also just being smart about pricing. I guess the last thing is and we mentioned it in the comments is we have walked away from some broker business and we have determined that, that broker model hasn't really favored the Company. And so we have intentionally shed some of that business over the last couple of quarters so that -- you net that out, obviously, the numbers are quite a bit more favorable.","Andrew Buscaglia","And can you talk a little bit just looking at the top line as well. It looks like the tuck-in was a little bit lower than normal. Just curious what you're seeing in the private market. It sounds like things have quieted down with that. You also may have had some divestitures in there, so--?","Don Slager","We were a little slow out of the gate this year but we're confident that we will intelligently spend $100 million or so in and around tuck-ins. again\/We're focused primarily in on tuck ins because of the return profile of those. And as you know, these things are kind of lumpy. But we've got a good pipeline and we've got a number of deals that we're working on now that we think will come through for the second half of the year and we will be right where we said we would be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Please go ahead.","Corey Greendale","First question I had is actually on the special waste environment. We do this survey every quarter and it -- the results of the survey said everything was strong but special waste looked a little weak. I don't know if it's just a quirk in our survey so wondering what you were seeing?","Don Slager","For us, Q2 is, again, from a comp perspective a little tougher for us because we had a pretty large job last year on the West Coast that did not repeat and again, you know that again, a big job like that, you've got to throw off your year-over-year comparison. Our first half special waste was -- remained about 3% above our three-year average so overall, we're still trending in -- we think in a good way.","So remember, too, that a portion of our special waste is manufacturing related, that manufacturing waste is reccurring while you stream and those continue to be very stable and strong. And then the event business, similarly related to land clearing and construction, tends to be sporadic. That's what we're seeing. It's not that unusual that we would see these kind of movements. So we're -- I know overall construction remains pretty positive for us. So we think over the long term, we're still in pretty good shape there.","Corey Greendale","Okay and then I actually had a question on recycling. The -- as you have done some restructuring in that business, I imagine we've all been focused on what happens when commodity prices are down; now it's actually trending up. Is there a formula you can give us? I think in the K, you've given us a formula each $10 per ton change. Does X to revenue and operating income, how that formula changes as you've restructured those contracts?","Don Slager","I think the formula is basically the same so for every $10 change in commodity prices for our basket of commodities it has about $0.03 in EPS impact on the business.","Corey Greendale","And you all see that changing -- sorry?","Don Slager","Well, it will change as we continue to change the contract. So what we'll do, Corey, is when we make enough progress, we'll reevaluate it and we'll update then -- probably and hopefully by the time we get to guidance next year, we'll have a new view of that.","Corey Greendale","I'm going to ask One real last quick one if you'll let me which is Chuck, can you give us-- which quarter do you expect the reversal of the extra day to hit?","Chuck Serianni","It's going to hit in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joe Box","So I appreciate the comments earlier that you guys have narrowed the gap between core price and yield and maybe I'm reading into the a bit much but when you look at core price, your open market component in Q2 was 4.1%; that's down from where it was that in 1Q and it's down from I think it was 4.8% last year. I guess I would have thought that, that this lever would have been pulled a little bit harder given the restricted component is down on CPI. Is there anything that we can point to that would maybe explain some of the moderation or is it just tough comps?","Chuck Serianni","I think we need to keep in mind that core price includes the anniversarying of recycling collection prices that we pushed real hard in Q1 of last year. So because those anniversaried, we had a little bit of a headwind in core price but as we mentioned before, even though we had that headwind, we were able to keep average yield consistent at 2%.","Don Slager","And Joe, our expectation is with, one, our focus on price and our internal controls around price and then our tools and Tyler mentioned synergy -- our Capture and PBS so with our tools, we keep a very close eye on that. We're rewarding salespeople for selling intelligently so we think and plus the market the general market has been strong. Growth has been there and our whole strategy around growth differentiation.","We think our value proposition to our customers continues to improve, right? All of that directionally says that we think we're going to continue to experience decent pricing in the open market because we will earn it and we can help offset some of these costs that we just can't normally offset through productivity so nothing has really changed in our MO or in the overall structure of the market.","Joe Box","So then it's fair to say then that some of your bigger open market classes or products like commercial and landfill are good probably seeing similar, if not better core pricing?","Don Slager","Well, remember on landfill, specifically MSW, most of the waste that comes in is municipal under long term contracts. We have very little open market MSW coming into our landfills any more, just because we have priced those assets according to what a realistic return is for running a landfill. So but we do see decent pricing across the board.","Joe Box","And then Don, just a question for you on some of the customer-facing initiatives that you alluded, the eCommerce in the release. I certainly get that this is aimed at reducing churn and if you do that, you guys could boost revenue and margins. So I'm curious, have you started to see the meaningful reduction in churn from the systems. And I guess more generally, when you guys think about pursuing a project like this, how do you measure the returns associated with it and what's your expected payback period?","Don Slager","Well, two things, right? The rollout of click-to-buy or eCommerce tools, right? We -- as I said in my commentary, we're already seeing very high percentage of new business coming through in those markets where we rolled it out. So the return comes from the fact that, that new business shows up with a lower cost of acquisition because basically people are self-serving, right? They are shopping online; they're making the business -- the buying choice without having the interface with a live human being knocking on doors. And then secondly, those online purchases tend to be and have been at a higher than average price because the convenience of shopping online has value.","On top of that, those purchases have come with, frankly, a higher degree of contract compliance where customers are opting in for -- to a service agreement because of the convenience of everything. So all of those things have value and now that the tools are proven, they are really user friendly and now they are rolled out almost across all of our markets. We have to just continue to push participation and the payback will be there. And frankly, if you look around the consumerism, that's where it is today.","And we've been probably a little late to the game as an industry but I think as an industry, we're probably ahead of many of the other people out there and certainly smaller competitors who don't have the capability or the resources to do this and that's, of course, part of our differentiation strategy, right? We've got to meet customers where they want to be, they want to do business they want do business, so overall, it's just one more slice of how we're going to compete in the market? How we're going to grow revenue intelligently and how we're going to do it ultimately at a lower cost to acquire.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Feniger","So on the volume side, did that -- do you see any -- of the underlying volume, did you see any discernible trends through the quarter and is it on track through July?","Don Slager","Yes, I would say that we're on track. We're exactly where we thought we be. I actually -- as we said before, we're at the high end of our guidance right now. So we feel very comfortable with the volume growth we've seen in the velocity that we have for the rest of the year.","Michael Feniger","Okay and was there anything specific, any region or were there any slowdown as you went through the quarter?","Don Slager","No, this is Don. I would say it's very broad-based across geographies, across most lines of business. So again, it's a -- we talk about the fundamentals being strong. We talk about the fact that we're still mid-cycle in the recovery. All of those things are pointing in the right direction. So we think it's a solid quarter and as Chuck said, we're reiterating guidance. We're saying that we think we'll l perform to the high end of that, as long as commodities hold up and the volume side as well. So we're pretty pleased with how the business is performing today and the economy is cooperating.","Michael Feniger","Just my last question, I think restricted pricing was 1.5%. Is this the bottom that we should see with how we've been seeing CPI trend or is this going to take another step lower in the second half of the year?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, this is pretty much the bottom right now in terms of restrictive pricing. Obviously, we've got a little bit of a CPI headwind in the second half of the year but that's already contemplated in our guidance. But the should be close to the bottom right now.","Don Slager","Yes, because what you will see probably sequentially, Mike, right, is that as we -- the majority of our price resets right around the second half of the year, right? So you're going to start picking up the 2015 CPI environment in the restricted pricing in the second half of 2016 and into the first half of 2017.","But the one thing obviously is that we're going to maintain this 2% average yield and the way we're going to do that is with a little bit better pricing in the open market. Chuck talked about some of the recycling collection pricing that we did last year Q2 that anniversaried to bring it more in line with what we charged on the solid waste side and we're going to see more of that in the second half of this year to offset the CPI headwind, right?","Chuck Serianni","And on top of that we're also going to continue to convert people to the alternative indices and we're also going to deal with the -- some of the pricing that we have today in and around the recycling to make that fair for us. That's going to continue to happen through this cycle and then as we've always said, a little bit of inflation is good and if we see some of that come through that, at some point, will help us well.","Don Slager","But also remember, right, we've been managing in this low CPI environment for quite a long time now and I think we've done it pretty effectively. So If you think about the number of years we've -- what's it, 1.6% average CPI?","Chuck Serianni","1.1% over the last verdict.","Don Slager","We maintained our margins. We continue to produce strong free cash so this business is built to withstand it and I think there's upside on the horizon. So --","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead. ","Brian Butler","This is Brian Butler in for Michael today. The first question, just on the margins. In the first half, on EBITDA margins, first and second quarters it was down, I think around 40 or 50 basis points and when you think about getting to the midpoint or the high end of your guidance, that means there's about another 120 -- 100 to 120 basis points in the second half. How should we think about that from a waiting perspective in third and fourth quarters? Was that more back-end weighted to the fourth quarter where you see much stronger margins or is it going to be more even?","Don Slager","So right now, keep in mind that here in the second quarter, the EBITDA margins were 28.3%, right? So consistent with last year, had a little bit of a headwind as we had mentioned in those margins because those legal settlements that we had talked about.","So if you back those out, you're close to that 28.5% that we had guided to for the year. In the back half of the year, we continue to see strong EBITDA margins. keep in mind that work day that I had talked about will also benefit the margins in the fourth quarter of the year so right now, we still feel very comfortable with our EBITDA margin guidance.","Chuck Serianni","And we have said, our operating costs are improving, right? We think that continues through the second half; again, this legal settlement doesn't repeat. Those are the things that will continue to pull that EBITDA margin up through the end of the year.","Don Slager","Brian, you are probably going to see a heavier weighting to Q4 than Q3 again because of the workday that Chuck mentioned, we're going to get a benefit from that but also we have an easier comp in the fourth quarter from the EBITDA margin performance in the prior year so most of it will be weighted to Q4.","Brian Butler","Okay and what was the benefit from the day? Did you guys give that?","Chuck Serianni","Well, just think of it this way is that in the first quarter when we actually had one extra day, it was about 50 basis point drag on margin so think of something similar in Q4 but obviously flipping the other way.","Brian Butler","Okay. And then I just on a follow-up question, when you talked a little bit on the service upgrades looking better, can you give a little bit more color on those trends on the commercial side of the business and are you seeing any recessionary signs for many of the commercial customers?","Don Slager","No, the trends are just moderately incrementally better but nothing negative.","Chuck Serianni","We continue to get strong price on the small container piece of the business, once again for the quarter, it was 3.7% for the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Misha Levental of Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Misha Levental","Just wanted to turn to the residential side for a second and the contracts you decided not to renew, I get the reason for shedding unprofitable volumes but just wondering what happens to these volumes? And where do the volumes go and how much capacity do you guys have left to shed?","Don Slager","Well, I guess, I won't share with you what we think we have to shed because frankly, we go into this thinking that as contracts come up for renewals, that because of our relationships, because of our great service, because of all the work we're doing to improve the customer interfaces, we think we'll be able to extend the business. But this issue of having some contract losses is just the nature of our business for as long as we have been doing this. The point I'm pointing to it is that we had this little CPI environment for many years.","We've taken it on the chin with certain customers and we get to a point of renegotiation and we have to express to a customer that when we entered into this agreement five or 10 years ago, we expected to see a 3% or 3.25% price increase as we modeled in old CPI. Instead, we have seen 1.6% or less price increase and our costs are going up at 2% or 2.25%. If a customer's not willing to understand the cost model and thinks that we're going to take another price reduction to go forward and it doesn't meet our return criteria, even though we may love the customer and enjoy being good citizen and good part of the community, we've got to have a return that's appropriate. So this is just business.","Right now we're just pointing out that we expected to lose some of those contracts in Q2. That's why we saw the -- one of the reasons we saw the reduction from 2% volume growth in Q1 to 0.5%. I don't want to blow it out of proportion, it's just part of the business but it gets a little lumpy and when it happens, we've got to point it out. But at the same time, we're having a lot of other successes in extending business and improving our work and our value, building strong relationships. Bringing the better service and the differentiation model that we talk about so overall, net-net of net, directionally, the economy has been good to us.","The Company is growing, our people are executing, the initiatives are deployed and we're seeing the benefits in the numbers. The quarter is performing right in line with where we thought we would be. And we're, again, saying that we're on top of our guidance and we expect it to hit at the upper end if we continue with just the same pricing -- or in commodity sales. So don't blow that out of proportion.","Misha Levental","Okay. And just turning really quick to -- of the refinancing that you guys accomplished, is there any additional room or opportunity for additional refinancings down the road or what's the state of affairs over there?","Brian DelGhiaccio","This is Brian. The reality of it is that we start seeing a number of maturities coming due beginning in 2018, right? So I think we've got maturities every year from 2018 through 2023 so that's the more likely scenario, as those maturities come to term, you will see us then obviously issue new debt at the market rates at that point in time.","Operator","At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I will turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.","Don Slager","Thank you, Nicole. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic way. Thank you all for spending time with us today. Have a good evening and be safe out there.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect."],"18253":["Republic Services, Inc.

Therefore, they exclude the benefit of an additional workday in the quarter versus the prior year.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.","Donald Slager","Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our third quarter results. We continued to successfully increase price in excess of our cost inflation, expand underlying EBITDA margin by 60 basis points and drive double-digit growth in adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow.","During the quarter, we continued to see additional weakness in global recycled commodity markets and further declines in U.S. rig counts and drilling activity. Despite these macro headwinds, the business is performing ahead of plan. As a result, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.28 to $3.30. We also expect to achieve the upper-end of our adjusted free cash flow guidance range.","In the third quarter, we generated $372 million of free cash flow and approximately $1 billion of cash flow year-to-date. We utilized our free cash flow to invest back into our business and returned the remainder of \u2013 to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We believe investing our free cash flow in acquisitions is the best way to increase long-term shareholder value.","We look for appropriately priced solid waste acquisition opportunities to further strengthen our leading market positions and expand into new markets with attractive growth profiles. We also look for opportunities to increase the scale of our environmental service offerings, including materials management and waste disposal. These offerings address the needs of our upstream E&P customers and downstream refinery and petrochemical customers.","In the third quarter, we invested approximately $275 million in acquisitions. This brings our year-to-date acquisition investment to $490 million. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust. For the full-year, we are on track to invest approximately $550 million and believe 2020 could be another strong year of acquisition investment.","Regarding 2020, given the predictability and consistency of our business, we are providing a preliminary outlook as we have in prior years. We are midway through our annual planning process. And assuming current business and economic conditions continue, we project the following for 2020, adjusted EPS of $3.46 to $3.51 and adjusted free cash flow of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion.","We will achieve this by continuing to prioritize the safety of our people and communities above all else, targeting value-oriented customers to drive profitable volume growth, leveraging our scale to minimize costs and drive operational improvements, continuing to make disciplined acquisition investments to grow free cash flow, and further investing in technology to enhance the customer and employee experience. Similar to prior years, we will provide detailed financial guidance for 2020 in February of next year.","Before I turn the call over to Jon, I\u2019d like to congratulate the Republic team for being certified as a great place to work for the third consecutive year. We believe an engaged and diverse workforce is the greatest indicator of our success. This is yet another recognition of the inclusive culture we are building at Republic, one where the best people come to work.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jon to discuss our third quarter operating performance. Jon?","Jon Vander Ark","Thanks, Don. In the third quarter, the pricing environment remained favorable. We continued to price in excess of our cost inflation and maintain customer defection or churn of 7%. Core price, which represents price increases to our same-store customers, net of rollback was 4.7%. This included open market core price of 5.7% and restricted core price of 3.1%.","Average yield, which measures the change in average price per unit and takes into account customer churn, was 2.8%. Average yield was strong across all lines of business. In our small-container collection business, average yield was 4.1%. In our landfill MSW business, average yield was 3.3%. This level of landfill MSW pricing is especially impressive, given approximately two-thirds of our MSW volume is restricted.","As you can see, our team has made great progress moving our disposal contracts away from CPI-based pricing to a more favorable pricing mechanism. In total, including both collection and disposal-related contracts, we\u2019ve converted $775 million, or 31% of our CPI-based book of business to a waste-related index, or fixed rate increase of 3% or greater.","Average yield is also benefiting from improvements in our municipal recycling collection contract. We are working to ensure, they reflect the true cost of recycling and include a more equitable risk-sharing arrangement. We\u2019ve now secured price increases from approximately 35% of our municipal recycling collection customers.","Turning to volume. Total volume in the quarter decreased 40 basis points and was in line with our expectations. Underlying volumes increased 10 basis points after normalizing for the impact of intentionally shedding certain volumes, including non-regrettable contract losses in our residential collection business and work performed on behalf of brokers. We expect the broker-related headwinds in our small-container business to decrease in 2020, as we anniversary some of the larger losses.","In the third quarter, volume across all collection lines of business improved sequentially. At the same time, average yield for our total collection business was 3.1%. On the disposal side of the business, MSW volume growth continued to be strong at 1.8% and C&D volumes increased 15.8%. As expected, special waste volumes decreased versus the prior year due to a difficult comp. Looking forward, the Q4 pipeline remains strong.","During the quarter, recycled commodity prices continued to decline. Our average price per ton in the third quarter was $72. This represented a $6 sequential decrease from the second quarter and a $34 decrease versus the prior year. Prices have continued to decline in October, and we estimate our October price per ton to be approximately $68.","Importantly, we continue to make progress transforming recycling into a more durable, economically sustainable business model. As a result, next year, we expect our sensitivity to commodity prices to decrease.","Next, turning to our environmental services business. In the third quarter, rig counts in the U.S. continued to decline. At the end of September, total U.S. rig counts were down 18% versus the prior year. And in the Permian Basin, they were down 15%. As a result, environmental services revenue decreased and created a 40 basis point headwind to total revenue growth in the third quarter.","Finally, turning to margins. Our adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 28% and decreased 40 basis points versus the prior year. Underlying margins expanded 60 basis points, which was more than offset by a 50 basis point headwind from an additional workday in the quarter relative to the prior year and a 50 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices.","We continue to see good operating leverage in the business, as we tightly manage costs and improve productivity. We expect this positive momentum to continue into 2020. Every year, we invest in innovative technology and equipment to enhance the customer experience, improve productivity, and make our employees\u2019 job safer, easier and more engaging.","For example, last year, we opened our first next-generation positive-sort recycling facility in Plano, Texas. To date, in Plano, we\u2019ve seen about a 20% reduction in our total cost per ton. It\u2019s important to note, this improvement is net of the depreciation expense associated with the upfront capital investment.","In the third quarter, we began to roll out our RISE platform in our dispatch operations and large-container business. The platform leverages the operational foundation we\u2019ve been building over the last several years. It includes additional mobile and in-cab technology with more real-time routing information and data visualization tools.","Ultimately, this platform enables us to digitally connect our customers, drivers, dispatchers, supervisors and trucks. Through this technology, we will further differentiate our product offering, empower our employees and increase productivity.","Next year, in partnership with Mack Trucks, we will begin piloting our first electric vehicle on a residential collection route. As you can see, we have a lot of exciting projects underway and we\u2019re looking forward to discussing them more in 2020.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our third quarter financial results, our 2019 guidance and the 2020 outlook in greater detail.","Chuck Serianni","Thanks, Jon. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $993 million and in line with our expectations. In the third quarter, we invested approximately $275 million in acquisitions, or $228 million net of divestitures. We also returned $271 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","At the end of the quarter, leverage was three times and within our optimal range of 2.5 to 3 times. Interest expense in the quarter was $98 million and included $12 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 18%. We also incurred a $4 million non-cash charge related to solar energy investments that qualify for tax credits.","For the full-year, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 15% and a $140 million non-cash charge. Relative to our original guidance, the benefit from lower tax-related expense is approximately $0.17. This benefit is being fully offset by two macro headwinds. First, a $0.13 headwind from lower recycled commodity prices and a $0.04 headwind from a decline in drilling activity.","Before opening the call for questions, I\u2019d like to provide some additional detail on our 2020 preliminary outlook. Regarding our adjusted EPS outlook, we\u2019re assuming recycled commodity prices remain at current levels of approximately $68 per ton. Next, we\u2019re assuming an adjusted effective tax rate of 21% and a non-cash charge of approximately $110 million. The year-over-year increase in tax-related expense in 2020 results in a $0.16 headwind to earnings relative to 2019.","Turning to our adjusted free cash flow for 2020. Our outlook includes $100 million of CapEx associated with the reinvestment of tax-reform savings. These funds represent continued investments in updated locker rooms, brake rooms and training facilities for the benefits of our frontline employees. This $100 million capital investment will not reoccur in 2021.","Our 2020 cash flow outlook also includes an incremental headwind of approximately $40 million from working capital. The working capital headwind is due to the timing of disbursements in 2020 relative to 2019 and will not reoccur in 2021.","Lastly, regarding capital allocation in 2020. Although we believe next year will be a strong year of acquisitions, our outlook only contemplates $200 million of investment. Additionally, we\u2019re assuming we spend approximately $400 million in share repurchases.","With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tyler Brown","Hey, good afternoon, everybody.","Donald Slager","Hey, Tyler.","Chuck Serianni","Hey, Tyler.","Tyler Brown","Hey, Chuck. So my big question here is on free cash as we think about 2020. So I just want to make sure welcome all mixed up. So you\u2019re talking the high-end free cash this year, I call it, $1,175 million and your preliminary midpoint is $1,175 million. I think that\u2019s right. I get the incremental CapEx on the facilities, but you\u2019re saying there\u2019s an incremental working capital headwind into 2020 as well Are those the two big kind of puts and takes, or is there something else in there?","Chuck Serianni","Yes. Yes, just \u2013 let me make sure I\u2019m clear, right? So if you go to the midpoint of the guide right now for 2020, it\u2019s $1,175 million. And then we have a total of $100 million of CapEx included in that number, right, for tax reform. So you would add that to that amount and then you would add back that working capital I talked about that $40 million. And when you do all that math, Tyler, you come up with a baseline free cash flow of $1.3 billion.","Tyler Brown","Okay. As we kind of think out into 2021, am I right on that?","Donald Slager","Yes.","Chuck Serianni","Yes. So if you think out into 2021\u2026","Tyler Brown","Okay.","Chuck Serianni","\u2026you\u2019ve got that baseline of $1.3 billion, plus the growth on top of that, just the natural growth in the business.","Tyler Brown","Right. Okay. And then just frankly, Chuck, I\u2019m just still confused on the solar energy investment. So, is there \u2013 is this like a CapEx item? Is it a M&A type of item? Or is it just a charge on the P&L that gives you a benefit on the tax form? I\u2019m just, frankly, a bit confused there.","Chuck Serianni","Yes. We\u2019re looking to more of it as an M&A type of item. So this is a \u2013 an investment that we\u2019ve been able to take advantage of. It gives us a really good return on investment. It is extremely low risk. And the great thing about it is, because of the tax credits, we get that benefit immediately. And so that\u2019s why you see a reduction in our effective tax rate and our cash taxes equal to the amount of the investment that we\u2019re making here.","Tyler Brown","Okay.","Nicole Giandinoto","Tyler, this is Nicole. Just to put a one point of clarification there. When we talk about our acquisition investment in the quarter of $275 million and year-to-date of $490 million, that does not include the solar investment, although it runs through the same line item on the statement of cash flow.","Tyler Brown","It does. Okay. So that\u2019ll be a Q4 item?","Nicole Giandinoto","Yes, yes.","Chuck Serianni","Yes.","Tyler Brown","Right. Okay. And then just maybe my last one for Don. Just so I appreciate the color on M&A, but I\u2019m curious. So have all of your transactions this year been in traditional solid waste, or there is some other verticals, it sounded like that may be the case?","Donald Slager","It\u2019s a mixture. We\u2019re still seeing great activity in the pipeline on really good solid waste companies, both collection and infrastructure like. And we\u2019re seeing some good opportunities in environmental services that are very adjacent to what we do. We\u2019re looking at opportunities that, again, are things that our customers have said they want to buy from us products and services in areas things that we\u2019re good at.","So I think maintenance, fleet operation, container management, land management, permitting, engineering, all those great capabilities that we have. We\u2019re finding great opportunities to move into a little space, more space that still has a great margin profile and works very well with our core business and our core capability.","Tyler Brown","Okay, all right. I appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.","Donald Slager","You bet.","Operator","Our next question will come from Derek Spronck with RBC. Please go ahead.","Derek Spronck","Okay. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Just on the acquisition front and just to follow-up just on the solid waste business side. Are they primarily tuck-in acquisitions? And do you have any opportunity to move into new markets here?","Donald Slager","Well, they tend to be primarily tuck-in acquisitions. And one of the reasons for that is, again, we\u2019re \u2013 we tend to be first or second place in \u2013 whatever 5% of our revenue, so we\u2019ve got a big market position. Tuck-ins tend to have the highest return. They\u2019re the easiest to integrate. They come with the lowest risk.","So there are still a fair number of small companies out there that are getting to a place in their company life cycle, where they\u2019re thinking about selling. And we\u2019ve got some degree of longstanding relationships with those sellers. And so we\u2019re well-positioned to buy those companies.","We have moved in some new geographies in the solid waste. There has been a couple of acquisitions we made recently that we\u2019re moving into adjacent geographies or into brand-new geographies, and we\u2019ll do that for the right deal, for the right market position. And so we think there\u2019ll be more of that in the future just as companies, again, come to a certain point in our life cycle.","Jon Vander Ark","And if we take a look going forward, the pipeline is robust. It will primarily be existing geographies only because we\u2019re in 42 states. So that\u2019s where the bulk of our opportunities will set, but we have plenty of things we\u2019re looking at in terms of \u2013 to Don\u2019s point, adjacent geographies or new geographies, we moved into Bend, Oregon recently and that was a very value-creating acquisition for us.","Derek Spronck","Okay. And what would you say is the average size from an acquired revenue perspective that you\u2019re making at this point of the acquisition cycle? And finally, any potential plans ever to come up here into Canada?","Donald Slager","Okay. Well, I\u2019m not going to give you the average, because it\u2019d be misleading. Most of the acquisitions are small. Again, these are small companies, I think, five, 10 trucks, right? And occasionally, you do get to a opportunity to look at a larger company, where maybe that company didn\u2019t have a successful succession plan, or the next-generation, or the third-generation really wasn\u2019t all that interested in it, or it was time to sort of monetize a lifelong work.","So there are \u2013 there have been a handful of sizable ones, but primarily, they\u2019re going to be small. So it\u2019s a lot of work to integrate small businesses and spend as much money as we have intelligently. We haven\u2019t made deals to do. As it relates to \u2013 but we look at everything large or small. That\u2019s kind of a battle cry if you look at everything, that makes sense for us.","And then as far as Canada goes, I would say this, we always kind of describe ourselves as a North American solid waste and recycling company on purpose. We like Canada. There\u2019s some great business up there. And we would have to be looking at opportunities that gave us a strong market position, which is really the sort of first pillar of our strategy. We\u2019re now looking to be a number nine in a market with no path to number three. And so that would answer your question. If there\u2019s things available that interest us, we\u2019re not going to shy away from that.","Chuck Serianni","We are already there today, both in the East and the West, largely in a post collections or disposal arrangement. So that gives us some ties or relationship already into those markets.","Donald Slager","You bet.","Derek Spronck","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Feniger","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I understand your earnings per share is up. I\u2019m just \u2013 if I look on a trailing 12 months basis, I think your EBITDA is up like 2% year-over-year. In a rather solid waste backdrop, it\u2019s below your peers and everyone is contending with their cycling issue. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of \u2013 is there anything structurally that we should be aware of in terms of your business mix or cost basis or regional mix? Help us understand that, that differential and how that differential might close in the next 12 months?","Chuck Serianni","Yes. I think the two big things that impacted EBITDA this year, in particular, were commodities. And that ended up being an over $50 million headwind for us. The other thing was environmental services, and we had talked about that Permian cooling down a little bit. And that was another almost $20 million of a headwind for us also on EBITDA.","Now, the good news is that, we were able to offset that \u2013 from those headwinds through some advantageous tax planning. But as we look into the future, and as we look in particular into 2020, we\u2019re saying at this point that we\u2019re going to have EBITDA margin expansion. And that\u2019s because we feel really good about how the base business is performing.","Michael Feniger","Chuck, just to be clear on that. So you\u2019re saying into 2020, you\u2019re confident you can get EBITDA margin expansion on the overall business, even with the \u2013 if OCC prices stay exactly where they are right now, and you extrapolate that into 2020?","Jon Vander Ark","That\u2019s exactly right. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.","Michael Feniger","Okay. And just like on the intentional shedding. When we go into 2020, is that over and do we see that finally drop out in \u2013 into next year?","Jon Vander Ark","We\u2019re expecting to grow the business next year, obviously, at very solid price environment and volume growth next year. That will be a mix of taking on a lot of profitable customers and still some shedding of less attractive customers. But, as we said in the prepared remarks, that will start to trend down overall. But that we believe we can grow the business, both price and volume. That\u2019s our aspiration. We\u2019ve proven we can do it. When forced to make a trade-off, we\u2019ll take price every time, right, that\u2019s how we think about the business.","So, again, to Chuck\u2019s point, with 2020, we\u2019ve got really solid plan for, feel really good about the economic backdrop and how we\u2019re going to grow the business. And that will involve slowing down of the shedding and taking on a lot more profitable business.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire","Good afternoon.","Donald Slager","Good afternoon.","Brian Maguire","Chuck, just wanted to come back to the $40 million of working capital that seems to be swinging around a little bit. Am I thinking about it right that you\u2019re kind of maybe pulling that forward into 2019 and that\u2019s what\u2019s getting you from more like the lower-end of the range to the upper-end of the range? And then that\u2019s just sort of coming out of the 2020 number as a \u2013 as an offset?","Chuck Serianni","No, it\u2019s really the timing of disbursements in 2020. It has to do with the calendar. And when we, honestly, when we cut AP checks, and it just happens to be a worst-case scenario for us in 2020. And that\u2019s why I said in my comments that it will reverse in 2021. That\u2019s a one-time headwind for us, that will reverse. It has to do with the calendar.","Brian Maguire","Okay. So you get the benefit then in 2021 as opposed to 2019 from that progressing?","Chuck Serianni","Correct.","Brian Maguire","Got it. Okay. And then just wondering, if you could comment on your outlook for special waste volumes. I think yesterday, they were down, but mentioned that was mostly because of a year-ago comp. Wondering what you\u2019re seeing in the pipeline there and the outlook there into fourth quarter?","Jon Vander Ark","Pipeline is solid, both for Q4 and then in early 2020. Beyond that, it\u2019s hard to say, but really solid outlook. And this \u2013 the nature of that business is a bit episodic, as you know. It can move around quarter-to-quarter, you see that with us, you see that with our competitors. And it\u2019s always a little down this quarter, C&D way up this quarter. So there\u2019s a little bit of swing in the nature of those jobs because they\u2019re project based. But we feel very good about the pipeline.","Brian Maguire","Okay. And just last one for me. Just on the \u2013 back on the tax rate in these solar credits, I think initially, you talked about kind of a $60 million offset in the non-cash line from that. It seemed like in the quarter it was only four. So running a little bit lower that. Is it just going to be a little bit lumpy and a lot in 4Q?","And then just thinking about it more longer-term, how many more years do you kind of anticipate having this sort of a weird lower tax rate and a higher non-cash other expense in there? And assuming, it does, and at some point, do we go back to that kind of high-20% tax rate at some point, or somewhere lower now?","Chuck Serianni","Yes. So we like the weird lower tax rate. I\u2019d like to keep that as long as we can. Back to your first question, yes, it will be a \u2013 most of the investment will occur here in Q4 for 2019. And these tax credits right now start to phase out through 2022 into 2023. So, we think that we have an opportunity to take advantage of these tax credits for the next few years.","Certainly, they\u2019re on the books. But at the same time, we need to make sure that we got the appropriate investments that those are available to us. And these investments typically have returns in the mid \u2013 high to mid-teens. And we\u2019re making sure that they don\u2019t just provide us with a tax benefit here that they\u2019re \u2013 that we\u2019re getting overall a good return on these investments.","Brian Maguire","Okay, thanks very much.","Nicole Giandinoto","So for those of you that\u2019s dialed in and entered the queue ahead of the start of the call, it looks like you\u2019ve dropped off. So if you want to get back into the question queue, please press star and then one.","Operator","Our next question will come from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sean Eastman","HI, team, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the environmental services, kind of acquisitions and stuff being folded into the mix here. It looks like this run rate here on the environmental services line actually picked up really nicely in the third quarter. And I believe that item was called energy services last quarter, so maybe I missed some sort of reclassification. But nevertheless, I\u2019m just kind of wondering if maybe some of the acquisitions done this year are going into that line. And what the run rate on that looks like as we go into 2020, particularly considering the softness on the E&P waste side?","Donald Slager","Yes. So we\u2019ve kind of broadened the category, okay?","Sean Eastman","Yes.","Donald Slager","And so when we first went into the E&P space, we call that Energy Services and that was, again, primarily handling oilfield waste, landfilling, and waste processing from the drilling rigs and so forth. And that\u2019s been a good business for us, a good investment. Again, it could be a little cyclical, right? And it could be impacted by some of the global issues that we face.","But all in all, still good business. We like it. We\u2019ve got great market position. A lot of that depends on sort of on your geography. A lot of those customers that we serve in the oilfields are customers that we serve in the solid waste space. And as we\u2019ve looked to sort of connect dots, we talk about going sort of upstream and downstream here. We find opportunity to do other things in and around that space that fit very nicely into what we\u2019re capable of.","So it comes down to, again, what\u2019s the margin profile of the business? How does it fit with our customers? Does it help us with stickiness? Does it help us to do more for current customers and kind of bigger wallet share? And does it fit within our capability? You won\u2019t ever see us do things that we don\u2019t know how to do, right?","And so yes, so it\u2019s opened up new doors. And it\u2019s not that much different, frankly, from when, I think, Jon, talked about a new geography in Bend, Oregon. We wouldn\u2019t have maybe known those people and had an opportunity, we weren\u2019t in Oregon. So, as you move the geography footprint out, it opens you up to new opportunities because of new relationships and so forth.","So not that much different there when we think about what\u2019s happening in the geography of the country, where Energy Services and Petrochem has got a big concentration.","Sean Eastman","Okay. And maybe you can just expand on the acquisition opportunities in that environmental services category, as you see it today?","Donald Slager","Yes. So we\u2019re not really ready to break it out. Again, as Jon and I both said, the majority of our acquisition activities still going to be in solid waste. Yes. So, these are, I would call it, sort of fringe opportunities. We\u2019re not going to do a natural act and try too hard. We\u2019re just going to make sure that we\u2019re making \u2013 being opportunistic and being intelligent and staying within our adjacent capability set. But most of the investment will still be in and around good old-fashioned core solid waste for the time being.","Jon Vander Ark","Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add is that, space is pretty fragmented. And our customers have asked us to be there, right? We\u2019ve been in this space for a long time in plant on properties. They understand our safety record. They understand our commitment to sustainability. They understand our performance levels that we can execute against. And therefore, they\u2019ve asked us to broaden our product and service offering to better serve them.","Sean Eastman","Interesting. Yes. I mean, it sounds like just another big consolidation runway. I guess, just to close it out there, maybe how this particular piece of the business, that\u2019s all kind of lumped together at this point. Just how it\u2019s kind of moving into 2020, some high-level comment on that would be helpful?","Donald Slager","Yes. I mean, I think that into 2020, obviously, you\u2019re going to see that line item on the \u2013 on our revenue breakout continue to increase because of the acquisitions that we made this year. And, as Jon mentioned, that we\u2019re going to remain opportunistic here in 2020 and see if there\u2019s any other opportunities that we can also include in that piece of our business.","Jon Vander Ark","Don mentioned some cyclicality, we expect a little bit of headwind on a year-over-year comp. If drilling activity remains flat, obviously, that could pick up and move up depending on where oil prices go. The downstream side of that business is much more steady from an underlying demand profile. And you\u2019ll see nice growth year-over-year there because of the acquisition that we made in the space.","Sean Eastman","Thanks, gents. Really helpful. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael Hoffman","Hi. Thank you very much. So just to tease out that last set of conversations, the $51.5 million, that now core environmental services a year ago. Was that pretty much purely energy and now 57.8 has the combinations of things to some \u2013 make sure I\u2019m understanding this whole conversation that just happened?","Jon Vander Ark","Yes. We\u2019re pulling a little bit from the core business. We\u2019ve been in the downstream for a long, long time. So we\u2019ve pulled a little bit of that into the business, but it\u2019s just the combination of both upstream and downstream and called environmental services, largely because that\u2019s what the space calls it, right? That\u2019s what our customers are\u2026","Michael Hoffman","Yes, I got that, Jon, but a year ago, was it basically just all ups \u2013 upstream energy and this year, it\u2019s got a mixture of things?","Jon Vander Ark","Primarily.","Donald Slager","Yes, primarily. So\u2026","Michael Hoffman","Yes, just...","Donald Slager","\u2026but we\u2019ve tried to say this a couple of times. Look, we\u2019ve been in and around this space for a long time. We\u2019ve had little sort of outpost in our business that have, call it, wandered into the space and done pretty well with it. So none of this is all new to us. It\u2019s just aggregating it into one place. And then as Jon said, it\u2019s somewhat of a fragmented business and customers want to sort of have that one neck to grab and where that reliable, well-known entity. And so it just seems to go together pretty well. So you\u2019ll see it now aggregated, and you\u2019ll see some good growth, as Jon pointed out.","Michael Hoffman","Yes. I\u2019m \u2013 sorry, guys. I just want to make sure I understood what was in the mix. I don\u2019t dispute the need or been in and all that. On the free cash flow side, one of the things that I think that also needs to be thought about is there at $68, that\u2019s an incremental level of pressure in the next year relative to the run rate through this year, and that would equal cash headwind as well that you\u2019re overcoming?","So when you start with a \u2013 we\u2019re flat year-over-year at the upper-end versus the new guide of midpoint at just $25 million for the incremental lock room spending and the like for employees, $40 million for working capital. There\u2019s some cash tax benefit. There\u2019s also an added headwind as some recycling cash, too, right?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, that\u2019s absolutely right, Michael. You\u2019re right on with that. And that was probably circa $20 million or so.","Michael Hoffman","Okay.","Chuck Serianni","And, obviously, that\u2019s a negative in our 2020 preliminary outlook in terms of the cash flow.","Michael Hoffman","Right.","Donald Slager","So, Michael, your point is right, that just further makes the point of the underlying strength of the business.","Michael Hoffman","Right.","Donald Slager","\u2026right? Chuck made a point that our baseline free cash flow is really $1.3 billion. And then all the good work that the team is doing on restructuring recycling contracts, at some point, we\u2019re going to gate that year-over-year impact to nothing, right? We\u2019re just going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to move the risk over where it belongs and then we won\u2019t have that conversation anymore.","Michael Hoffman","So can we shift the price for a second? So I love the progress that\u2019s being made on both. What needs to change either within your control or macro that you can narrow the gap between the yield reported and the core that\u2019s being offered? That\u2019s the ideal scenario, right? Is that gap closes overtime? What can you do to close that gap?","Chuck Serianni","Yes. That\u2019s obviously us focused on maintaining that stickiness and increasing that stickiness with the customers, right, because what we\u2019re talking about now is that what we have historically called churn. The difference between that yield in that core price. And then that\u2019s where all of the technology that Jon talked about and that connectivity with the customers really come into play.","Nicole Giandinoto","And then, Michael\u2026","Michael Hoffman","So what I\u2019m hearing is, you\u2019re tending to \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, go ahead, Nicole.","Nicole Giandinoto","I was going to say, the other thing that helped us and will continue to leverage in the future is the capture pricing tool.","Michael Hoffman","Right.","Nicole Giandinoto","Because as Chuck said, you increase the stickiness to reduce customer defection and then all your new units by leveraging the capture pricing tool, we\u2019ve got that discipline to move with the market when we sell.","Donald Slager","Keep in mind, customer defection is at 7%.","Michael Hoffman","Yes.","Donald Slager","That\u2019s pretty well below. Can we get to six? We\u2019ve been below seven before. Can we get it to five? We\u2019ll see, right? But you have a certain amount of defection just from businesses failing, going bankrupt moving out of the country, et cetera. So that that\u2019s all in that number. So we start with a pretty low defection number"," But everything else we\u2019re doing around all of our customer service initiatives, even fleet reliability, all the new technology, the RISE platform the Jon talked about, all that is to create differentiation in the product value. And can we gain more customers at a higher price? That goes hand in hand with \u2013 using the capture tool? Can we keep customers longer? That reduces this thing called churn over time?","Jon Vander Ark","It does. When I say differentiation helps us on both fronts. The other thing that is helping us is upward pressure on landfill pricing, which you\u2019ve seen now for a number of cores in a row that we\u2019ve done a good job with, right? We pass that right through to our collection company, right? And that collection company then is charging higher price than the Street. So we\u2019re getting \u2013 we\u2019re taking on customers at a higher price, which ultimately reduces the churn.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. That\u2019s close enough. Excuse me, I know there have been some media reports about some strikes that have been struck against your company in a number of your markets. I\u2019m just wondering if you \u2013 has there been any impact on your business in terms of extra costs to send in replacements, et cetera? Any color would be great?","Jon Vander Ark","Sure. No, yes. So first of all, we\u2019re pro employee, that\u2019s where we start the conversation from a values basis. This has been incredibly narrow. This is one business unit in the Northeast, right? It\u2019s less than two dozen employees. And we are targeting good faith. Local team is doing a great job, right? And we\u2019re hoping we get back to work soon.","There has been a couple of one day events in a handful of markets. Good news is, customers are not disrupted. We\u2019re getting the recycling and garbage off the ground, right, in the Northeast and data in those minor kind of disturbances, right? And from a cost standpoint, it\u2019s been nominal for the quarter.","Jeff Silber","Okay. I appreciate you putting that in perspective. My follow-up question, one of your competitors had mentioned, if you look at the different end markets, there seem to be a bit of a bifurcation between those that are more industrial-related like the special waste area and more \u2013 and those that are more consumer-focused. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re seeing the same kind of different trends between those end markets? Thanks.","Jon Vander Ark","Yes. Well, just to put it in perspective, only less than 10% of our revenue is really tied to manufacturing. We\u2019re really tied more so to the consumer, right? So as we look at our various lines of business right now, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of weakness in that manufacturing piece of the business that I talked about.","Keep in mind also that, when you think about a manufacturer, you think about a plant, if they are going to do away with a shift or so \u2013 their waist doesn\u2019t go down to zero, right? They still need the waste service. They may just not needed as often. So that might be a little bit of a service decrease, but it would have a minor impact on our overall revenue.","Donald Slager","Yes, overall, we would say, the underlying economy is pretty, pretty strong. And, as Jon pointed out, certain parts of our business are event-driven. We see some fluctuations in construction with seasonality, some special waste. There are large events jobs that come and go. But, as you average through the year, we\u2019re growing the business. We don\u2019t get too excited about seasonality and we don\u2019t get too excited about these episodic things.","The fact is, we\u2019ve got this great portfolio. We\u2019re across 42 states and 200-plus markets. And so, if there\u2019s a weather event, or a forest fire or work stoppage, or this or that, or whatever, this portfolio sort of kind of wins the day, and it always has and we think it always will. It\u2019s one of the benefits of being \u2013 having the size of scale we have. And then, of course, we lag.","So if the economy gets a little soft, we kind of lag that, right? So sometimes we find ourselves just kind of working through these little blips that otherwise people get excited about. And our view now and our view for 2020 is, the economy is in a pretty good shape. And we\u2019re well-positioned\u2026","Jeff Silber","Okay.","Donald Slager","\u2026across the markets and we\u2019re going to get our share of the growth that we want to get.","Jeff Silber","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye","Thanks very much. The color you provided on the solid returns from the solar investments was helpful. But I was hoping to kind of broaden the question to the general topic of sustainability commitments. You called out in your release, your environmental commitment to 35% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030. I believe some of the other sustainability goals you announced in July include increasing landfill biogas reuse, 40% increase in materials recovery.","And I just want to understand maybe be helpful, as we think about your capital priorities and how they are aligning with the sustainability goals, how does that impact or what are the areas we should expect to see increasing focus on four capital deployments over the next few years? Besides the solar investment, what would you maybe call out in the 2020 CapEx plan or other investments you\u2019re making that address this?","Donald Slager","Yes. The first thing I\u2019d say is, we believe that environmental sustainability and economic sustainability needed to be tightly linked. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re so passionate about restructuring the business model for recycling, because over time, we\u2019re long on recycling and we want to be a major player in that space. But it has to have really attractive financial returns for us to continue to invest there, and we\u2019re seeing that absolutely in given markets over time.","So the market is moving there in a positive direction. I think you\u2019ll see things like landfill gas energy projects over time, a place we meet, or place we further invest to meet the sustainability goals, and we put out ambitious goals for 2030. We don\u2019t have all the ticks and ties and all the plans to achieve every one of those items built out yet, because they\u2019re ambitious goals and they\u2019re more than a decade off. But we feel really good that we\u2019re going to do those in a responsible way, value creating way. So that, not only is the environment winning, but the shareholders winning as well.","Chuck Serianni","And this isn\u2019t a one-time investment either that you\u2019re going to see all of a sudden pop into our CapEx, right? This is something that we\u2019ve been doing over time, and it\u2019s already baked into our cost structure. So there won\u2019t be any big blips on the radar relative to our investments in these areas.","Noah Kaye","I think that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Maybe a little bit more near-term. Just want to understand based off of the M&A that you completed year-to-date, what is kind of the rollover revenue contribution to 2020? And is that basically what\u2019s assumed in this preliminary outlook?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, it is. So we\u2019re about 70 basis points of revenue rolling into 2020. And then you get on top of that the revenue associated with the $200 million of investment where we\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to make in 2020.","Noah Kaye","But \u2013 so \u2013 does \u2013 in other words, is your outlook assumes both of those and you assume some contribution from next year\u2019s M&A as well?","Chuck Serianni","That\u2019s right.","Noah Kaye","Okay.","Chuck Serianni","The 70 basis points rollover, plus the revenue impact of the $200 million of investment.","Noah Kaye","Okay. Okay, that \u2013 that\u2019s helpful. And then, you are \u2013 you kind of defined expectations for the recycling headwind for next year as well around $20 million. Are your processing fees now covering most of your third-party volumes? Is there further improvement opportunity there, or is it really now all about redoing the municipal contracts and improving the technology? What are the levers to pull that could maybe reduce this headwind assuming a constant commodities environment?","Chuck Serianni","Right. So I think that we made really good progress in terms of the pricing initiatives and in converting to the processing fee. Right now, the processing facilities themselves are \u2013 continue to be profitable. And we continue to look at that profitability in those fees, so that we can get what we consider to be an appropriate return on this facility. So, we\u2019ve got a little ways to go in that regard. And then we still have conversations that we need to have with our municipalities to get them to convert over to these processes.","Jon Vander Ark","Yes. And we\u2019re marching into City Hall every day. And I think the good news is a lot of conversations in flight and the nature of the conversations is turning, I think a year ago, it was staff pushing back on us. And now we are here staff inviting us in saying, I want to make sure that recycling is sustainable in my community. Let\u2019s go on to gather to talk to the elected officials, because ultimately, we need to get more pricing to the curb to make this sustainable for the long-term.","Noah Kaye","Yes, makes sense. Thank you very much.","Operator","At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I will turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.","Donald Slager","Thank you, operator. In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter performance. Through the relentless operational execution of our employees, we achieved strong pricing, 60 basis points of underlying margin expansion and continued grow \u2013 growth of both earnings and free cash flow. The momentum in our business is strong. The economic backdrop remains supportive of continued growth in 2020.","As always, we will continue to manage the business to create a long-term value for all stakeholders, including our employees, customers, communities and shareholders.

Slager","Thanks, Ed. I am pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year performance met and exceeded our guidance. Before discussing our fourth quarter achievements, I will review our financial performance. ","Revenue of $2 billion for the quarter and $8.2 billion for the full year. Total price growth in the quarter was 1.5%, with core price up 0.6%, including MSW landfill price of about 3%. Volumes increased by 0.2% excluding the impact of fewer workdays. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.53. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $1.96. Our fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $208 million. Our full year adjusted free cash flow was $909 million, which exceeded our guidance. ","We repurchased 1 million shares in the fourth quarter for $29 million. During the past 12 months, we repurchased 15.7 million shares or 4% of our stock for $460 million. We have $650 million remaining under our authorization to return to our shareholders over the next 2 years. We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Total cash returned to the shareholders was approximately $770 million during 2011. Based on our current market capitalization, this represents a 7% cash yield. ","During the fourth quarter, we settled with the IRS on the legacy Allied exchange of partnership tax issue. This settlement allowed Republic to reduce tax reserves in the quarter. ","Our field organization continues to target profitable growth and effectively manage our cost structure. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 20 basis point sequential improvement in our total Collection volumes. Our industrial Collection volumes were positive on a year-over-year basis for the quarter and for the full year. Our cost of operations as a percentage of revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis after adjusting for the impact of higher fuel expense. SG&A expense was 10.6% in the quarter and 10.1% for the full year. Our safety performance continues to improve with a 4.5% favorable reduction in our frequency rate. ","Some of our operational achievements during 2011 include: we increased the automated portion of our residential fleet by 8%. 59% of our residential fleet is now automated, which exceeded our year-end goal. We continue to invest in our CNG fleet and natural gas infrastructure, with 6% of our fleet now operating on natural gas. In 2012, we expect about 65% of the trucks we purchase to be fueled by CNG. ","We increased recycling capacity by investing $46 million in developing and upgrading our recycling centers in 2011 and are planning on spending an additional $60 million in 2012. These investments will add approximately 12% of incremental recycling volume over the next 18 months. These are new tons to the company that were not previously delivered to a Republic recycling facility or disposal site. ","I would like to thank our field operations for their continued support in executing our strategy of achieving profitable growth and maintaining a safe working environment. Tod and Ed will now update our financial performance.","Tod C. Holmes","Thanks, Don. Fourth quarter 2011 revenue, as Don said, was approximately $2 billion. This reflects the following components of internal growth: core price growth, up positive 0.6%; commercial and industrial price was on average up 1%, with residential remaining more competitive due to the municipal and franchise contract pricing environment and also the lagging impact of prior year's CPI. Since our price on index-based contracts tends to lag, we are impacted by the lower CPI environment of 2010, which has not fully anniversaried. Given the current CPI environment, we expect index-based pricing to modestly improve in the second half of 2012. ","Landfill price was up 2.5% -- 2.9%. This is consistent with the third quarter. Within that component of our business are also third-party open market landfill customers where we are increasing price in the range of 4% to 5%. ","Our fuel recovery fee increased 1%. The increase in fuel recovery fee relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.87 in the fourth quarter of 2011 from $3.14 in the prior year. This is an increase of 23%. The current price of fuel is relatively constant with the fourth quarter at $3.86 per gallon. Our guidance assumes that fuel prices will remain at this level during 2012. ","Turning to commodity revenue. This decreased by 0.1%. Commodity prices actually decreased 9% to an average price of $125 per ton in the fourth quarter from $137 per ton in the prior year. Fourth quarter recycling facility commodity volume of 509,000 tons was up 13% from the prior year and up 6% on a same-store basis. Our current commodity prices are about $118 per ton, and our 2012 guidance assumes that commodity prices will remain at this level. ","Now recently, there has been volatility in the commodity markets. I'd like to take some time to discuss our recycling business in further detail and provide the impact of changing commodity prices on our business. We generate third-party revenue from the sale of about 4.1 million tons of recyclables per year from our material recycling facilities, or MRFs, and also from our collection companies that sell materials to third-party processors. ","Our MRFs process and sell approximately 2 million tons of recyclable materials per year. Of the materials we sell, approximately 70% are fiber-based, including cardboard, newsprint and mixed office paper; and 30% are other recyclables, including metals, plastics and organics. For reference purposes, at current volumes, a $10 per ton change in commodity prices at our MRFs translates into approximately $20 million of annual revenue and $0.02 of earnings per share. ","Now in addition to our MRFs, our Collection operations directly collect and deliver 2.1 million tons of recycling material to third-party processors each year. This includes recycling services for industrial, commercial and residential customers. For our materials delivered to third-party MRFs, we generally earn a rebate based upon a percentage of the ultimate commodity sale. For reference purposes, a $10 per ton change in commodity prices translates into approximately $7 million of annual revenue and $0.01 of earnings per share within our Collection line of business. So in total, including our MRF and our Collection operations, a $10 per ton change in commodity prices results in approximately a $27 million change in annual revenue and a $0.03 change in earnings per share. ","Let's turn to volume for a moment. Excluding the impact of fewer workdays in the fourth quarter, volumes increased by 20 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see volume improvements in the Collection line of business. Fourth quarter Collection volumes of negative 0.2% improved 20 basis points sequentially from the third quarter. Industrial volumes is positive year-over-year, and Commercial is only slightly negative. ","Our disposal volumes, consisting of landfill and transfer activity, were up 0.2% versus the prior year. As expected, special waste was negative in the quarter compared to the prior year due to the high levels of special waste volumes in the fourth quarter of 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2011, there was approximately one less work day, as I mentioned earlier, which resulted in a 40 basis point decline in revenue. ","Now let me talk to margins in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. Fourth quarter 2011 adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.8% compared to 30.5% in the prior year, a 70 basis point decline mostly related to the impact of fuel and commodity. The components of the margin change are as follows: first, transfer and disposal costs. The 50 basis point improvement here relates to decreased disposal expense and is primarily due to the redirection of waste streams into lower-cost sites. ","Maintenance and repairs. We saw a 50 basis point increase in expense here, and this relates to an increase in the cost of tires across our supplier base and also refurbishing containers versus purchasing new containers. This resulted in a higher container expense -- repair expense at a lower cash cost. ","Fuel. The unfavorable fuel expense increase of 100 basis points was due to the 23% increase in the cost of diesel, which I discussed earlier. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel costs was an increase in related fuel recovery fee, and this resulted in a net decrease in EBITDA margin of about 30 basis points. ","Next, our landfill operating costs. The 40 basis point improvement in here relates to a reduction in remediation expenses. In the prior year fourth quarter, there were charges for environmental matters that did not repeat in the current year. ","Next is recycling cost of goods sold. The 20 basis point increase in expense here relates to increased rebates to customers for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold increased to an average of $41 per ton from $40 per ton in the prior year. Additionally, commodity revenue decreased, which resulted in a decreased spread of approximately $13 per ton. ","Now cost of goods sold tends to lag the change in commodity revenue, which negatively impacts our spread when prices are falling. The net impact was a 10 basis point decline in EBITDA margin. ","And finally, our SG&A expense. SG&A expense was 10.6% of revenue, an improvement of 30 basis points from the prior year after excluding cost to achieve synergies. The reduction relates to expenses in the prior year for legal settlements. Full year 2011 SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 10.1%, and looking ahead to 2012, we would expect full year SG&A expense to be approximately 10%. ","Finally, DD&A as a percentage of revenue was 11.5% in the current year versus 11.1% in the prior year. The 40 basis point increase in expense relates to a favorable landfill liability adjustment that occurred in the prior year. DD&A continues to be higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles. ","Ed will now discuss interest expense, taxes and free cash flow.","Edward A. Lang","Thanks, Tod. Q4 2011 interest expense was $105 million, which included $17 million of noncash amortization. In 2012, we expect to call the notes due in June 2017. Our EPS guidance includes the favorable impact of refinancing this debt, with total interest expense of approximately $395 million to $405 million. This includes noncash interest of about $60 million. Our guidance excludes any premiums paid or debt discounts written off in connection with early extinguishments. ","Our Q4 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by settling Allied's 2000 to 2003 tax years with the IRS. The settlement was finalized in December and included Allied's 2002 exchange of partnership interest matter. We expect a full year 2012 tax rate of approximately 39%, which will fluctuate by quarter. ","I will now discuss free cash flow. Full year 2011 adjusted free cash flow was $909 million, which consisted of cash provided by operating activities of $1,767,000,000, less property and equipment received of $886 million, plus proceeds from the sale of property of $35 million, plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of $9 million, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $17 million, less cash tax benefit from debt extinguishment of $33 million. Therefore, adjusted free cash flow equals $909 million. ","As noted in our 8-K, we expect 2012 adjusted free cash flow in the range of $775 million to $800 million. The decrease from 2011 is due to a $140 million increase in cash taxes mostly related to the impact of bonus depreciation. In 2012, bonus depreciation drops to 50% from 100% in 2011. Since bonus depreciation is an acceleration of a tax deduction, the cash tax benefit claimed in any given year reverses in future years. We expect cash taxes as a percentage of provision included in our adjusted free cash flow to be approximately 80% in 2012. After adjusting for the change in bonus depreciation and lower commodity prices, 2012 adjusted free cash flow is growing in the mid-single digit range when compared to 2011. ","Balance sheet. At December 31, our accounts receivable balance was $826 million, and our days sales outstanding was 37 days or 24 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.9 billion at December 31, and our excess credit available under our bank facility was approximately $1.5 billion. ","I will now turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Ed. In 2012, we will remain focused on executing our strategy while improving return on capital through continued disciplined pricing that exceeds cost increases utilizing our ROI-based tools; growing the business through organic growth, acquisitions and investments in recycling and processing technology; managing our cost structure through programs designed to gain operational efficiencies, including fleet automation, CNG conversion and standardized maintenance practices; investing in our people through training and development and maintaining a safe and positive work environment, allowing us to continue to attract and retain top talent; enhancing our customer's experience with Republic by continuously improving service delivery and providing solutions to meet their changing demands and buying habits.","Before we move into Q&A, I'll provide 2012 financial guidance. We expect 2012 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.98 to $2.02. Our guidance assumes that fuel and recycled commodity prices will remain at current levels for the full year. We anticipate 2012 free cash flow in the range of $775 million to $800 million. We expect annual revenue growth of 1.5% to 2%, with core price improving 1% to 1.5% and volume improving by approximately 0.5%. Our EBITDA margin guidance is 30.5%. 2012 capital is expected to be $860 million. ","At this time, operator, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is on pricing, on your pricing guidance. Does the guidance of 1.5% bake in the fact that you're going to reprice the business that you guys did not price, if you will, last year? And maybe if you could also tell us what CPI adjustment pricing bakes in? And any pickup in C&D you guys are baking into that 1.5%, or are you baking that business to be flat?","Donald W. Slager","Okay. Hamzah, we'll try to break this out for you. Well first, you mentioned in your question pricing the customers that we did not price last year, and for practical purposes, we are reviewing every customer in our book of business at least once annually. Those customers are either coming up through a contract situation that has an escalator clause on an annual basis, or they're part of our RPM process where we're reviewing roughly 1\/12 of our customer base in the open market every month. So we're reviewing and potentially adjusting every customer throughout the year. Having said that, as you know, we've had some price compression in the area of municipal contracts. We've been rolling back a little bit of price to keep some of that business in various markets. Now going forward, we're going to continue that practice. So in 2012, we're going to maintain that focus on RPM and that monthly cadence that we talk about. Of course, we're going to have those contracts coming due throughout the year just as they do every year, and we'll have the benefit of CPI starting to roll through those contracts based on the higher CPI prices. You know it takes 12 or 18 months for that to occur. Having said all that, if we get a little bit of a better economy, that certainly helps the pricing atmosphere and customer sensitivity as well. So what we've got here is this pricing range that kind of predicts that the first half of the year is going to be somewhat below -- somewhere below 1%, and the second half of the year is going to be somewhere below 2% but approaching and we're going to be ramping up throughout the year based on how these contracts roll through. So that's the pricing outlook for '12.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All right. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up question, maybe for Ed, is just on the tax benefit with the Allied settlement. What's the EPS impact or benefit for the tax during the quarter?","Edward A. Lang","For the tax impact in the fourth quarter, the impact was about $0.10 of EPS. So we're -- the adjusted EPS was $0.53. It would have been $0.43 without the tax benefit related to the audit settlements.","Tod C. Holmes","I'd also mention commodities.","Edward A. Lang","And then if you look at it, obviously with the -- between the time we got on the call in October and year end, we probably saw about a $0.02 headwind from commodities because we didn't see the price decline in the domestic markets for fiber until November, which was after the time we were on the earnings call in October. So you look at what the price decline was in the quarter after the call, it was about a $0.02 headwind. So if you wanted to adjust it for that, we would've done about $0.45.","Operator","Next question comes from Corey Greendale with First Analyst (sic) [Analysis].","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Question about the general pricing environment. I realize that the business doesn't turn on a dime. And I know -- I hear your comments about the municipal pricing environment. But could you just speak kind of directionally, are you seeing that getting tougher, better or sideways?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, your first comment was right on. The business doesn't change very quickly. We would characterize it as being very similar to last year. We certainly don't see any change in behavior of the larger companies. The publicly traded companies tend to have a pretty keen focus on this from our perspective. And otherwise, their pricing environments had sort of changed market to market. But generally speaking, we're still seeing a little pressure in the resi business regarding large contract renewals, and we're still out in the marketplace, as I said, answering Hamzah's question, keeping the same cadence and focus that we did in '11 and we're in the market every month.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. And my second question's actually on acquisitions. I saw in the guidance, you're guiding to about 50 basis points in acquisitions, which is a little more than you've been doing. Is that -- is there's something you've done recently that's contributing there? Or are you assuming future acquisitions? And can you just speak generally to your outlook on and expectations for acquisitions in 2012?","Donald W. Slager","You're right, Corey. It's a little more, but it's kind of marginal. We're saying that for '12, we're going to spend between $50 million and $100 million and that's in our cash flow projection. So that will come in sporadically throughout the year, but we've got a pretty good pipeline. The strategy hasn't changed. We're still looking at tuck-ins. So existing markets, we're not looking to expand outside of our market footprint. We're just looking to build the 240 markets that we have stronger, and that's where we'll live in 2012.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Levine with JPMC.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The question, I think you said that you expect the CPI-linked pricing to improve modestly in the back half of the year. Just trying to get a better sense of what modestly means and whether we really should think of pricing kind of being flat. I know you guided in quarters, but stable at these levels, stabilizing the first half and then ramping in the back half. Or do you expect it to kind of go up from here? Just trying to maybe separate the impact of CPI length from what you guys would guide to for a purely competitive price.","Edward A. Lang","Well, I mean how the CPI works for the first 6 months of 2012, you're really still living on the CPI that was printed in calendar '10, so that was about 1.5%. So in many of the restricted price contracts that we have, that's kind of the core price. Now every contract is unique and it could be modestly different from that level. But essentially, we're still living on the 2010 very low CPI for the first half of this year. Then starting in the second half, some of the contracts where we set in July and others where we set in October, we'll start to see the higher CPI that was from calendar '11, which is in the 3% neighborhood. So that's why, as Don mentioned, what we'll see as far as the progression of pricing during the course of the year, that pricing will probably be a little bit lower than 1% during the first half of the year, quite similar to what we saw in the second half of '11. And then beginning in the third quarter, as we start to see the higher calendar '11 CPI reflected in the resets, that's why we'll be above 1%, and then as we go through the second half of the year, be exiting the year in the 2% neighborhood.","Donald W. Slager","Yes. Remember, Scott, that's why we're always saying 12- to 18-month lag. Some of these contracts reset trailing 12 months. Some of them reset point in time, year-over-year, and we've even got a couple that reset on last year calendar basis. And so it's that 12- to 18-month lag that works -- working our way through, so we're going to steadily kind of climbing out of that trough.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And could you comment -- it would be a similar proportionate increase there Q2 to Q3 and then Q3 to Q4 where more of the contracts reset midyear and you have more of a step up then.","Edward A. Lang","It's kind of spread throughout the second half of the year. So I would say yes, you'd probably -- it's kind of a 2-step process as we actually work our way through the year. It doesn't all step up July.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, but just back to the comment I made earlier. Think about the range being 1% to 1.5%, that's sort of averaging up. So something less than 1% in the first half, something less than 2% or approaching 2% in the second half, and that's kind of the way we're looking at how this ramps up.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And a follow-up on volume environment. I know you highlighted a couple contracts that you won last quarter in California and Florida. Are those meaningful in terms of basis point contribution of volumes? And\/or what are you seeing in terms of general volume environment with folks getting a little bit more upbeat in the economy these days?","Edward A. Lang","I would say the largest contract that we called out on the last call was San Jose, and that starts up in July. So that doesn't start up until midyear. Some of the other contracts are gearing up here in the early part of the year. So we'll start to see some of the volume impact, but again, it's a little bit more noticeable come July 1 because of all the contracts, San Jose is the largest.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Collectively, could that get to 50? I mean, is it 50 basis points, 100 basis points? Or is that too large in terms of the impact?","Edward A. Lang","For all the contracts you're talking about?","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes.","Edward A. Lang","Yes, I would say it's probably about 40 basis points.","Donald W. Slager","And I'll keep this in mind too. I'm sure someone will ask this question anyways. We've got this roll off of the Oakleaf-Waste Management business, right. So with that acquisition that occurred late last year, we're kind of steadily weaning ourself off of that volume, and that's a fairly good-sized piece of about $30 million worth of revenue that's going to roll off. And so netting out, right, we're still volume positive here even though that -- even though of that acquisition between Waste and Oakleaf.","Operator","Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The 0.5% increase in volumes that's contemplated for 2012 seems potentially modest given all the talk out there of the proverbial green shoots on the construction side, which is really something new when you think about how weak things have been the past several years. So on the front lines, are you seeing any noticeable impact from commercial construction, multifamily housing or anything along those lines? Do you get the feel that maybe this time, the improvement is for real and it could help your volumes this year?","Donald W. Slager","We're watching all the same things you are, and there's a lot of little feel-good stories being printed up. But as you know, we're very late cycle. We're late cycle generally, but we're very late cycle as it relates to this construction. So we don't tend to haul a lot of volume until well after these projects are out of the ground and when they're in sort of the final finishing stages of completion. So we'll start to count those loads when we start to see them, and we'll be glad to tell you about them when we're getting them.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. Okay. Fair enough. And then on the cost side, given the affected diesel prices have had over the years and the importance to the bottom line, combine that with your plan to make, if I heard correctly, 65% of the truck purchases CNG this year. Could you expand a little on how the growing presence of those CNG trucks is going to change the equation in terms of costs?","Edward A. Lang","Well, right now, it's marginal because as we mentioned, only 6% of the fleet is CNG today or natural gas. So it will be, I would say, a growing story over the next several years. But here in the early part of the process, it doesn't have a measurable impact on the fuel expense. So -- but what we'll be doing, we start with 6% a year; we replace about 10% of the fleet every year. So as you could see, we'll be gradually building so that within, say, a 5-year period, about 1\/3 of our fleet will be CNG or natural gas, and then I think it becomes more visible to you looking at fuel expenses as a percentage of revenue. So I don't think you'll see it too much in the early stages here, but it is definitely a good cost reduction opportunity for us as we move forward.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, so keep in mind, right, we've got 15,000 trucks. So we'll buy 500 or so CNG trucks this year and maybe next year, and we'll look at it beyond that. But as we're looking through our fleet strategy here, we're looking at the larger fleets where this makes more sense. We're certainly looking at areas where our customers have an interest in CNG and where it enhances our product profile with our customers. So it's just a steady move forward, and again, we're living within our normal capital spend, if you will, very traditional with kind of our Republic philosophy here. And we're going to keep that cash flow predictable and just live within our means, and we'll just allocate that CapEx around maybe more efficiently as we go forward.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure, that's a good plan. And when you do make the conversion to CNG, if I remember correctly, the savings on that, a daily or per mile basis is somewhere in the ballpark of 30%.","Edward A. Lang","That's roughly correct, yes.","Tod C. Holmes","But there's higher upfront.","Edward A. Lang","There are some upfront fees. But yes, as we've discussed, even on a fully loaded basis with the infrastructure cost, the payback period on the CNG investment is about 4.5 years and has a return on invested capital in the high teens.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","On the cash flow side, there's 2 pieces of this I'm trying to get my hands around. You paid out roughly a little over $300 million in dividends, do a little over $900 million in free cash flow. That's about 34%. How should we think about that mix if you look out over time 2, 3 years? How should we think about what the dividends should represent as a percentage of the free cash?","Tod C. Holmes","Well, it's going to be a function of what opportunities we have available, but I would think the dividend would be probably somewhere in the 45% range, say between 40% and 50%. And the dividend, we would expect to grow as the cash flows and the business builds. So that's foundational to the company. And then we have the share repurchase, which I think you've seen the activity and our ability over the years to buy back the shares efficiently to create long-term lasting value. And there's a little bit of flexibility there. The acquisition, or not the acquisition, but the merger is 3 years behind us, and so we're really about enhancing the strong platform that we have. And as opportunities come up, we're building the pipeline and we're out there doing a little bit more on acquisitions where it makes sense. So there's a little bit of a flux between, say, over a 3- to 5-year basis between share repurchase and acquisitions depending on which creates more value. We're committed to all 3.","Donald W. Slager","Sure, and as we've always said, Michael, we think this business can steadily and consistently grow free cash kind of mid to upper single digits, right. And that's what we think we're doing here in '12 and then we'll just, as Tod said, we'll kind of keep that balance intact. We've got a strong balance sheet, and we're committed to return cash to shareholders efficiently and we've got the flexibility to be opportunistic where we can be. So I think it's a good approach.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the other part of the free cash question, if bonus depreciation gets revisited and pushed back to 100%, how do we -- how does that reflect in the -- what's the incremental change to the $775 million, $800 million? And then the other side of that is how should we think about the cycle of bonus depreciation if at '13, '14 if I'm trailing off, I don't get a revision?","Tod C. Holmes","Yes, I think we'll cross the \"what if Congress does something\" when we get there. I think we can talk to the impact. I think Ed has indicated from '11 to '12, the total impact was a swing of $140 million. And so if you look at the '12 component alone, that's actually a negative $40 million. And then as you look out into '13, given what we've got in terms of the past legislation or the current legislation, that $40 million probably goes to about $80 million or $90 million. And then it starts to tail off in terms of the headwind as those 2008 and 2009 100% bonus depreciation years anniversary up. Now again, as we've said, capital is important to us. We're going to manage the taxes, so we'll see what happens as we approach the end of the year. And if Congress actually acts, we may adjust our capital spend accordingly. One thing I want to emphasize is our free cash flow -- or excuse me, our cash taxes is pretty strong. It's -- cash taxes are about 80% of book taxes for '12. So we feel like even though we've got a little bit of a headwind this year, we're still in a good position from a cash tax standpoint, we continue to actively manage that.","Donald W. Slager","Right. And from an activity-based perspective, if you look at the last couple of years as bonus depreciation has sort of been in or out, we've been able to adjust our spend and our buy to take advantage of it. So we've got some flexibility to do that, as Tod said.","Operator","Bill Fisher with Raymond James, your line is open.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just on the -- you got it to roughly consistent EBITDA margins like 30.5% and hopefully, the pricing, I guess, would take up most of the cost inflation, wage and benefits. And you got a hit on recycling commodity prices. Just on the math, is it the offset's going to be the productivity gains you talked about? Or can you just talk about some of those pieces?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, remember the headwinds, we've got the commodity headwind, we've got fuel on a year-over-year basis. And then we think -- again, there's still going to be a little bit of price compression in the residential side, which we've got baked into our pricing guidance. And then yes, we're just controlling costs. We've got productivity measures. We talked about the automation, the CNG, the maintenance initiatives, all those things working together to build better productivity in the business. So we've got good traction on all those programs, and net-of-net, lead us to this guidance. So we're pretty positive about the year.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just, Tod, I think you gave the $118 is where the commodity price was. Do you have what was the full year for '11, the commodity price?","Tod C. Holmes","Yes, we do. It's $145.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","$135?","Tod C. Holmes","$145.","Operator","Next question comes from Al Kaschalk with Red (sic) [Wedbush] Securities.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","It's Al with Wedbush Securities. I want to follow up on this margin question because I'm having a hard time getting it. As you know -- I think you said $118 per ton, is what Bill had just mentioned, and you're using Chicago-based pricing. Is that fine? Is that right?","Edward A. Lang","No, that's our actual blended rate for all commodities.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So...","Tod C. Holmes","And most of it actually is probably West Coast.","Donald W. Slager","In terms of the [indiscernible].","Edward A. Lang","About 1\/3 third of our volume is West Coast. So actually, we're probably a little bit biased, but it's actually our internal national average.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. But I'm probably splitting hairs trying to get the exact location, but what percentage of your recycling is fiber-related sales? I thought it was up about 55%, 60%.","Tod C. Holmes","2\/3. About 70% is fiber.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if you're assuming current price of $118 as the -- is that what you're assuming is the average for '12 in the budget?","Tod C. Holmes","Right.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Why -- that's a 20% headwind, right, from the prior year, and yet you've got pretty good margin profile from what you just posted, a 60 or 70 basis point decline. So it seems like the EBITDA margin guidance is a bit aggressive given some of these headwinds, and I'm just wondering what tailwinds you have to push you to that.","Donald W. Slager","Well let's take commodities side for a minute. We do have price of between 1% and 1.5%, right. So we're going to see that, as we talked about previously on one of the questions, CPI is starting to roll in, getting a little traction there and that's going to make a difference for us. And then we are looking at positive volume. So those things together, again with the offsets of the productivity programs, we think will make that difference.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And on the volume side, not to press you a little bit, but volume, is that back half positive, therefore full year is positive? Or you get right out of the gate positive?","Donald W. Slager","Let's talk about full year, and remember we've talked all through '11 about the pretty positive picture in and around industrial volumes. And Collection volumes increased sequentially now I don't how many quarters in a row, but Industrial's been kind of a bright spot for us. Residential is improving, so all those things continue to improve. There's no one region or no one story that's making that happen, but the trends just continually are improving and we see those improving through the year.","Tod C. Holmes","I think when you look at the full year, we see modest positive volume, now quarter-to-quarter it may fluctuate a little bit depending on special waste because that activity can be somewhat event-driven. But it's not quite the situation maybe that price is. Well, it may be built a little bit in the second half of the year. But it's not quite as powerful as that CPI impact that Ed explained earlier. So positive throughout the year with a modest build.","Operator","The next question comes from Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.","Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you provide a bit of an update on your national accounts business? I realize that's still small, but how has it been growing? And have you seen increased appetite from corporations who are interested in landfill diversion? Beyond just optimistic PR on the subject.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, I would say we believe in our national accounts program, we've got a decent sized book of business there, just shy of about $500 million annual book and it's growing -- it's sort of a single-digit percentage, maybe 5%, 6% a year. We have a number of very large national account clients who are very concerned and very consistently working with us on landfill diversion and other ways to manage their waste. I think if you look back into the early 2000s where large companies were coming out in favor of sustainability programs, I think many of them kind of lost their appetite in the recession that we saw earlier in the decade. But this time around, even though the recession's been a little deeper and longer, we've seen those national account partners of ours really be consistent with their interest in waste diversion and coming up with new ideas. And so we're working very closely with those large clients in recycling, waste diversion, minimization and so forth. And again, it's that kind of partnership that we're trying to build with those people that allows us to build that business.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions today. I'll now turn the call back to Mr. Slager for his closing remarks.","Donald W. Slager","Thank you very much. In closing, I would like to thank the entire Republic team for our performance in the fourth quarter.

Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us, to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 performance. Our fourth quarter results capped off another solid year. Our financial performance continues to reflect our focus on executing our strategy, designed to profitably grow our business, manage our cost structure, generate consistent earnings and free cash flow growth, and improve return on invested capital.","During the quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.57 which represents an increase of 14% over the prior year. Core price was 3.5% and average yield was 2.2%. Average yield remains above 2% even with below average contribution from CPI-based pricing.","Volume growth was 50 basis points or 90 basis points excluding the impact from approximately one less work day. Our volume performance was in line with our expectations. And finally EBITDA margin expanded 70 basis points to 27.9%. As expected, most of the improvement was due to a reduction in SG&A costs and leveraging operating cost while growing units.","Turning to the year, adjusted EPS was $2.22 and adjusted free cash flow was $885 million. Both performance metrics exceeded the upper end of our guidance ranges. Core price was 3.3% and average yield was 2.1%. Full year volume growth was 1%. This is the fourth straight year of simultaneous price and volume growth. And finally, EBITDA margin expanded 20 basis points to 28.3%.","Importantly throughout 2016, we continued to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders, which include our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. For our customers, we strive to provide the highest level of customer service, and are committed to developing differentiated and superior products. Some of our accomplishments during 2016 include the following. First, we expanded our product offerings on our e-commerce platform. Customers are purchasing small container, temporary large container and residential subscription services online. This technology addresses the evolving needs of our customers buying preferences, and provides a lower cost sales channel.","Second, we improved the capabilities and functionality of our customer portal and mobile app with approximately 1.8 million customers now enrolled. This represents an increase of over 50% from the prior year. And third, we opened three customer resource centers designed to enhance our customers' experience through a more professionally trained customer service team, improved technology and additional communication channels.","We have already transitioned approximately 50% of our call volume to the new centers and expect the transition to be complete by the end of 2017. For the communities we serve, we remain devoted to delivering safe, convenient and value-driven solutions while being good stewards of the environment. With respect to safety, we continue to see a favorable reduction in employee incidence and our performance remains over 40% better than the industry average. On the sustainability front, we are recognized as the industry leader with awards from the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and Carbon Disclosure Project that are both best-in-class. For our employees, training and developing our people is a priority and we strive to be the employer of choice. Over 33,000 employees recognize the progress we have made and have told us they see the difference.","For example, in 2016, we saw the largest gain in employee engagement since we began measuring employee engagement five years ago. And employee turnover continues to improve. Our driver turnover rate is at its lowest level in four years. And for our stakeholders, we remain committed to creating long-term value and 2016 was a perfect example. Our strong performance included EBITDA margin expansion, high-single-digit earnings and free cash flow growth, and approximately 20 basis points of ROIC improvement.","We returned $819 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a cash yield of approximately 5%. And, finally, we delivered total shareholder return of approximately 33%, which is nearly triple that of the S&P 500 average. I'm proud of our many achievements during 2016 and remain encouraged by the underlying strength of our business. I want to thank the entire Republic team for their hard work and execution.","Chuck will now discuss the financial results in more detail. Chuck?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Don. Fourth quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $89 million or 3.9% over the prior year. This 3.9% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 3.6% and acquisitions of 30 basis points. The components of internal growth are as follows.","First, total average yield grew 2.2% over the prior year. Average yield in the collection business was 2.7%, which includes 3.8% yield in the small container business, 2.4% yield in the large container business, and 1.6% yield in the residential business.","Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.7%. It should be noted that a majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing price restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.5%. Core price consisted of 4.7% in the open market and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business.","Second, our total volumes increased 50 basis points over the prior year, or 90 basis points excluding the impact from approximately one less workday. The following discussion of volume excludes the workday impact. Volumes increased 2.2% in the large container business. Volumes decreased 40 basis points in the small container business and 70 basis points in the residential business.","Small container volumes include a 110 basis point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have increased 70 basis points. The decline in residential volumes was expected and resulted from not renewing certain contracts that fell below our return criteria.","Residential volume performance increased 40 basis points sequentially, as some of the losses from early in the year are beginning to anniversary. The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 2.7%. Landfill volumes included growth in C&D of 14% and special waste of 1%. MSW volumes were consistent with the prior year.","Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 10 basis points. The decrease resulted from lower fuel prices at the beginning of the quarter and the lag in our fuel recovery fee. In the fourth quarter, the average price per gallon of diesel increased 2% to $2.47 from $2.43 in the prior year. The current average diesel price is $2.57 per gallon.","And, finally, commodity revenue increased 1%. The increase in commodity revenue includes higher processing fees charged to third-parties and an increase in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 24% to $134 per ton in the fourth quarter from $108 per ton in the prior year. Fourth quarter total recycling volume of 626,000 tons was down 2.5% versus the prior year. Cost of goods sold was up 20% from an increase in rebates paid for recycled commodities.","Now I'll discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 70 basis points to 27.9%. The improvement included a 90 basis point decrease in SG&A cost, partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in cost of operations. The 90 basis point decrease in SG&A was primarily due to higher levels of incentive compensation and legal costs in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2016 SG&A expense was in line with our expectations at 10.5% of revenue. The 20 basis point increase in cost of operations is due to an increase in fuel expense primarily due to a larger CNG fuel credit recorded in the prior year.","In 2015, the full year CNG fuel credit was recorded in the fourth quarter, whereas in 2016 the credit was recorded ratably. This timing difference increased fourth quarter 2016 fuel cost by 40 basis points. Excluding CNG credits, fourth quarter 2016 gross margin expanded 20 basis points. It should be noted that CNG credits expired at the end of 2016.","On a full year basis EBITDA margin expanded 20 basis points to 28.3%. SG&A cost decreased 50 basis points to 10.3% from 10.8% in the prior year. We believe SG&A cost will continue to decline to 10% of revenue within the next couple of years.","I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Fourth quarter 2016 interest expense was $90 million, which included $12 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 35.8%, which was favorably impacted by tax planning opportunities. The net impact of these tax items increased EPS by approximately $0.02 during the quarter. Full year adjusted free cash flow was $885 million. Cash flow exceeded the high end of our guidance range, due to lower than anticipated cash taxes of approximately $30 million. Excluding the benefit from cash taxes, adjusted free cash flow would have been $855 million.","Now I'll turn the call back to the Don.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Before we go into Q&A, I will discuss our 2017 financial guidance. The details of our guidance are included in our 8-K filing. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.32 to $2.36, which is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided last October. Our expected performance represents high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth, after excluding an $0.08 headwind from an increase in our effective tax rate.","We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $875 million to $900 million, which is also consistent with our preliminary outlook. Our expected performance represents high single-digit to low double-digit growth, after excluding a $90 million increase in cash taxes.","We expect the annual revenue growth of 4.5% to 5%. Selected components of our revenue guidance include average yield of approximately 2%. We expect the pricing environment in 2017 to be relatively similar to 2016. Volume growth in a range of 1% to 1.25%, contribution from recycled commodities of 50 basis points to 75 basis points, and acquisitions of 50 basis points. This relates primarily to tuck-in acquisitions and the rollover impact from 2016 transactions. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 28.5% to 28.7%. This represents 20 basis points to 40 basis points of margin expansion over our 2016 performance.","2017 net capital expenditures are expected to be $975 million, or 9.9% of revenue. We anticipate investing approximately $100 million in tuck-in acquisitions, and we expect to return approximately $900 million of total cash to shareholders through $450 million of dividends and $450 million of share repurchases.","In summary, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and supportive of continued profitable growth. The investments we are making in our business and the solid execution of our strategy are producing positive results and creating long-term value. We remain focused on delivering consistent earnings and cash flow growth, improving return on invested capital and increasing cash returns to our shareholders.","At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs.","Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good afternoon. It's Derrick Laton on for Brian. How are you all?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Brian.","Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, just a couple questions on \u2013 so, on the M&A front, looks like you guys ended up spending maybe $60 million for tuck-ins in 2016. Just curious if this was maybe lack of sellers here, or maybe you guys just kind of being patient with regards to valuations, and then also just for your target for 2017 is there maybe some upside here given that kind of where things ended in 2016?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, a couple things. Yeah, I like your choice of word patience, we are I guess somewhat conservative on the side of acquisitions. We're not going to do bad deals just to hit an acquisition target goal. So we have confidence in the pipeline. We have had to walk away from couple of transactions, laid in due diligence, when we found things that we didn't think were acceptable, so we're going to buy good companies and good recurring cash flow. So there is the patience for you.","As it relates to 2017, we've got a strong pipeline. We've got a number of deals in advance stages of due diligence already. So we again, we're confident that we'll put a $100 million to work intelligently in 2017. And as we always say, we've always got a little more capacity if there is more out there. But we're only going to buy things that fit and we think the pipeline will be good for us this year and the $100 million is just a good place to start.","Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And maybe if I could just shift gears quickly to the recycling side. I noticed on your outlook saying it should be maybe 0.5% to 0.75% increase for 2017. Could you maybe provide some color just kind of on how the recycling market is looking for you guys currently, and then maybe the cadence for that 0.5% to 0.75% increase, are you kind of expecting that mainly in Q1 and Q2?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So what we do there, Brian, (sic) [Derrick] is what we do every year, we \u2013 when we give guidance and this is something we've done again historically, for as long as I could remember, we \u2013 with things like fuel and commodities, we just try to peg the rate at the time we conclude our budget. So we've used a $140 per ton average for our commodity prices throughout the year, we want to stay away from speculating what the markets may or may not do, because you don't know some of these things tend to be volatile. We can provide you the detail of what happens for every $10 of improvement, and what that means to EPS, if you need that, certainly we can have Chuck provide that for you, but that's the way we do it. We think that's the smartest way to approach it rather than for us to try to forecast it with a crystal ball here.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","And just to put some more color around that, as Don mentioned, as we have disclosed in the past a $10 change in the average commodity price is worth about $0.03 in annual EPS. Now it's important to keep in mind that, that's based upon our average mix of materials and OCC makes up the most of our mix, but it's only 45% of the mix overall.","Derrick Laton - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you, guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","You bet.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question is from Hamzah Mazari at Macquarie.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon, thank you. Just a question on landfill volume expectation for 2017, you know, Don, what's baked into what you are expecting on the landfill volume side, I know overall volumes are 1%, just any thoughts qualitatively or quantitatively would be helpful?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, Hamzah, I think just directionally, right, as the boarder economy recovers, we're going to see just continued improvement in our small container business. We're going to \u2013 that will help drive our landfill volumes. We'll see continued improvement in \u2013 we think in the C&D business certainly. We know, we have strong trends coming out of Q4. We think those continue into next year, certainly not only for our own volumes, but the third-party volumes that come to our site. So there is no new big deal on the horizon, but special waste is pretty sort of normalized I would say going into next year. So I think just everything that we've laid out for our guidance, we think just strong underlying fundamentals continue to drive the business forward.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And just to follow-up. You've made a lot of technology investments and ramped those up, just curious, what inning do you think you're in, in terms of seeing the benefits from some of the technology investments longer-term, whether it be route density or other areas you've invested in, just curious if you're in early innings or later innings? Thank you.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","No. We thanks, Hamzah. We would class that as early innings, right. So, we're very happy with the course that we've charted, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from customers from our own teammates, employees, but we're going to be \u2013 continue to invest down that road and build out a digital platform, but we're early in the process.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Tyler Brown at Raymond James.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Tyler.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, Chuck. So in the past, you guys have noted that the velocity of margin improvements really will ultimately be arbitrated by CPI, recycling prices, and, I guess, volume. So as we look at it, I mean, all of those things are kind of moving in the right direction and I think you even have a tailwind from some hedge rollovers here in 2017. And you obviously guided to the 28.5% to 27%, that's great, but I don't get the sense that that's really outside of what your original expectations were back in Halloween. So I'm just curious, big picture, if there is something that's working against the margins that maybe doesn't give you confidence that maybe the margins could improve more than 20 basis points to 40 basis points.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, a couple things to keep in mind, Tyler, is that, first of all, the CPI lags. So whatever we print then in 2017, we won't see the benefit of that until the second half of 2018. So that's the first item. The second item is that you talked about the roll-off of the fuel hedges. What we need to keep in mind also is that the CNG credit goes away. So that's something that was available to us in 2016, but that doesn't repeat. And, also, right now, we're looking at overall higher fuel prices. So, thinking about the margin then, so we're talking about 20 basis points to 40 basis points of margin expansion. Think about 10 basis points of that coming from commodities, the rest coming from the core business, 30 basis points or so. So we see that as pretty strong and sustainable growth.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So let me chime in here too. Tyler. We'll see the full benefit of the CRC consolidation not until 2018, right. So that will layer in as well. And just, overall, right, we're talking about guidance that has high single-digit to low double-digit expansion, both in cash flow and EPS, right. So, we've got up really strong margin -","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, yeah.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Built in and I think the signs are positive. So we've got more tailwind than we do headwind at this point. So that's a good thing.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right, right. No, it feels like good momentum there. But \u2013 so, Don, I've got to ask you about maintenance and repair. So if I look at M&R, I think it was up only 2% year-over-year, which I think is the lowest level of inflation that we've seen in that line since maybe 2011. And I'm just curious if you're viewing this as maybe a big inflection? Is OneFleet finally starting to really permeate through that line or how should we think about that maintenance and repair line, kind of, going forward?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. You're right on, Tyler, I mean, we are seeing the benefits of OneFleet. As you know, all of the divisions now have gone through it. We'll finish certifying those remaining divisions that went through it in fourth quarter of last year. But we've got good results from OneFleet in Q4 and we expect to see those continue into 2017. So the initiative is paying off. And, remember, it's not just showing up in the R&M line. Fleet reliability shows up in customer service. Good customer service shows up in price.","Reliable fleet show up in the lowest driver turnover we've seen it for years. So there is a lot of other benefits. And then, of course, the icing on the cake is the CapEx savings, right. So, we've saved $100 million so far as we've begun to very methodically age the fleet, extend the useful life of the fleet and we've got about another $100 million to go. So, OneFleet is a success in our minds and it's going to continue to pay dividends and that fleet reliability as it builds is going to continue to show up in other parts of the business for us.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Great, guys. Nice quarter. Thanks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Tyler.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from the Andrew Buscaglia at Credit Suisse.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, guys. Congrats on a good quarter.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So, I got to ask I noticed you talked in a little bit of energy services guide. I would think that you kind of keep that in your back pocket, but you guys must feel pretty confident that could have somewhat of an impact. Can you remind us how big that is right now as a percentage of your revenues? I mean it's pretty -","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","So it's about 1% right now, Andrew, in terms of overall revenue and what we've guided to is about 25 basis points of increase in that line of business during 2017.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And what's your assumption there just I don't know in terms of like the energy market? Are you assuming things improving or just staying up where they are?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Pretty much consistent with where they are right now. We're beginning to see some rig increases, especially in the Permian Basin. And so that's what gives us the confidence to call out the 25 basis point increase.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","And you're right to point out. Things look better in that direction. They have historically. So again, as I just said to Tyler, there is more wind pushing us than in our face this year. So it's a good way to start the year out.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Definitely. And yeah, the other topic, sort of the other topic du jour is your tax rate. Your stock certainly is reflecting some optimism there. Have you guys had conversations around this about what you would expect and how are you thinking about for the balance of this year?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, I'll ask your one \u2013 I'll answer one question directly. We've had a lot of conversation about it, because as you know we are a statutory payer, right. And so, if and when there is some type of tax reform, we likely stand to be a beneficiary of that. So don't know when that will occur or how will occur, and as you know there are probably a number of levers that get pulled. So, we're not counting any of that just yet, but we certainly are thinking about how it might impact us. And so we're also taking the wait and see approach that you all do, but if there is some movement there, it's good for us.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question is from Corey Greendale with First Analysis.","Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Hi, this is Ken Wang on for Corey. Thanks for taking my question. So we understand Las Vegas is about to start the process of negotiating an extension with you in part because they want single-stream recycling. So just wondering, can you share any insight into the renewal process, how much capital you expect you may invest for single stream recycling and the likelihood of the contract going out to bid?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, as a rule, we don't discuss individual contracts or the individual contracts terms, and certainly not when we're negotiating contract. So I can't do that for you, but I will just tell you that, more broadly, we've get great relationships there again, in and around Las Vegas, our people do an outstanding job and we've got a strong track record there, and the best assets in the marketplace. So ultimately we think the business there will continue to perform inclusive of those contracts that are coming out, but that's all I can tell you about any contract that we're in the midst of negotiating, today.","Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Noah Kaye at Oppenheimer.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe we can start with the commercial business, really seeing again nice growth in small container and large container, I think particularly the small container given the intentional shutting of business. With that, can you may be update us on where your current commercial churn rate is and have we maybe reached a point, where most of that rationalization and then shutting up unprofitable volumes is done?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So let's focus on a couple of things. The defection rate or more positively the retention rate is 93% across our business. And so, there hasn't been a material movement in that. It takes a lot of transactions to move that number in a meaningful way. So \u2013 but the retention is very strong. Our pricing yield in Q4 was 3.8% in the small container business, which is the highest level it's been in seven years. I think that further underscores just the strength of that business, also such a show up frankly in our fleet reliability, the great job our people are doing, I think the value of the products, some of the digital platform that we've initiated with customers, so I feel pretty good about that.","As far as the growth there, we've had decent consistent net unit growth in small container. Again, if you factor out the non-regrettable losses in Q4, we grew 70 basis points in that business, it's one of our best lines of business so to speak. And as it relates to 2017, we'll see about the same amount of shedding a business there that we saw in 2016. So, we're being very methodical and very intentional about moving away from business that is broker business frankly and a business where we're not face-to-face with customers.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then as I think you pointed out, everyone is having a lot of conversations about tax reform, and I am wondering, if that has in any way impacted some of the conversations around M&A certainly with some family-owned businesses that one can imagine that there could very meaningful consequences of potential tax reform, has that impacted in any way the timing of some of your M&A activity, and would you expect it to potentially be a benefit going forward once we get more clarity?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, Noah, I don't think it's really impacted anything to-date because there hasn't been any tax reform and nobody knows what it would be, so if I were selling my business today based on some empty promise of tax reform, I probably wouldn't do it. So, we're not seeing that kind of activity. We \u2013 I can see there are potential for somebody making a decision, but I think that wouldn't be the only thing that drives your decision, I think if people are in a window of thinking about selling their business then they could use tax reform or some new tax consequence as the reason to finally make that final determination. But I don't think it's the one and only decision or the one and only decision point that people will use. So, I think, there's been a lot of talk about that. I think, it's much to do about nothing at this point. But frankly the pipeline for acquisitions look strong and if there are some kind of tax reform that's meaningful, it could only make it potentially stronger not weaker.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Feniger at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. I know that the \u2013 you're forecasting the average yield to 2% and it's actually trended down 2015 it was 2.3%, 2016 I think it was around 2.1%. I know that 2016 had that headwind from CPI that goes around 20 basis points, 30 basis points from the low CPI of 2015. So can you just walk us through why the yield is still drifting slightly lower, shouldn't the CPI headwind at least be abating by the time the second half of the year?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","By the time the second half of the year comes around that's true. But you got to remember that we still have the first half of the year where we're dealing with the CPI of 0.1% so that's a significant headwind for us. Yeah.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. That make sense. And I know there was a lot of discussion so far about the pipeline on M&A front. If you go through the due diligence and I understand to be patient, but I'm wondering is there any point where maybe you decide to step up that buyback amount, and say it's more \u2013 it makes more sense maybe just to buy your own shares at this valuation?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, look, we talk repeatedly and frankly for years with people about what we call a balanced approach, right, of using free cash flow. And I think frankly, most of our owners would like to see us continue to, one, invest in the business, and invest in organic growth, and invest in M&A when we can buy cash flow, reoccurring cash flow at the right multiple. And that's what we do with our tuck-in program, right. So, tuck-ins are the very best way to get the fastest return on those investments, they have the lowest risk, they are the easiest to integrate and so on.","So, as long as those tuck-ins are there, and they are quality companies with quality revenue, draw quality customer base, we're going to continue to do that. That is a very good use of cash for the business. And part of that balanced approach then is with the remainder of the cash, our balanced approach to dividend increase and buyback. And we buy back 2%, 3% of our shares generally, annually.","So it's that formula, if you will, that we've been using over the past many years that we've been doing this. And it's that very formula that I think has helped driving the appreciation in the stock, and in the market cap of the company. So I would argue that it's working very, very nicely. So we're going to continue to do that.","And if and when a larger opportunity comes along, we always tell people that we've got the flexibility with our balance sheet to go after a larger deal if one comes along. There are some very nice companies that could consume $100 million purchase price all by themselves. We're certainly prepared to do that for the right opportunity, and if something like that comes up, you'll be hearing about it.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's perfect. And just lastly guys, C&D showed pretty strong growth in the fourth quarter, I think it was up double-digits. From what you're seeing so far in January and February is \u2013 are the trends still intact in that part of the business?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. C&D has been a really good business for us. I will give you a couple of data points, one, remember we've talked a lot about household formation driving the business, that drives business formations. So C&D is continuing. That's going to set up more small container growth in the future which we're excited about certainly.","But if you look at the household formation in total, we're still lagging nationally the 5th year average. And so we think there is a fair amount of growth yet to be had there. We're well positioned and very focused on getting our fair share of that growth. At the same time, we're growing both price and volume in that space. So in the temporary large container business on a combined basis of price and volume, we got 4.8% volume growth, and even in permanent business. So the business is very healthy, the supply and demand economics are working the way they should in a rational environment and so the business should continue to post good results for us certainly through 2017, and I would say likely well beyond that.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the Michael Hoffman with Stifel.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, Don, Chuck, Brian. Thanks for taking my questions.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","How are doing, Michael?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Michael.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'm good. Can't complain, what's the point anyway.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Right.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I have a question with regards to free cash, just it sort of walks back towards this leverage question everybody keeps asking, so you posted an $885 million this year 2016, but it's held by cash taxes. So if I smoothed the tax conversation, $855 million looks like what if taxes are all the same. Would it be fair to say $855 million goes to $965 million to $990 million, if cash taxes were the same in both periods?","Brian M. DelGhiaccio - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Michael. This is Brian, just to think of it this way. Is that, when we take a look at the cash tax as a percent of provision, right, in 2016, it was about 79%. Okay, we expect that to move to about 90% to 95% in 2017. So just that differential creates about a $90 million cash tax headwind.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. So... go ahead, sorry. Well, so what I was getting \u2013 I mean, maybe margins aren't moving as much as some are wringing their hands about. But the fact of the matter is the operating leverage through to cash is actually pretty good, if cash taxes were all things being equal.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. That's right.","Brian M. DelGhiaccio - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Said another way is that on a similar cash tax as a percentage of provision basis, the free cash flow is growing high-single digit to low-double digits, which is very strong.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. Okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","So, I will say it another way. That's the strongest as far as from a guidance perspective, the strongest guidance we've given in, I don't know, how many years. Both EPS or free cash growing at high-single digits to low double-digits. So the business is moving ahead. We're getting the operating leverage and it is showing up in the cash. That's your point.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. That's what I was trying to get at. Okay. So back to a mix question. Where do you think you are in the \u2013 and this is back to your comment about household formation against business formation. So where do you think you are in your model catching up to the household formation trend in the commercial collection side, which is your best margin business? So that's sort of that, the hand at your back on the margin opportunities, is that new business formation, that service interval upgrades, the service new adds versus losses, all of those patterns? How do you think about where you are \u2013 your company relative to the 1.5 million in housing starts?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, I think we're still in early innings on that. I think probably maybe you even thought that we'd be further faster just the way the economy would work. But I think there's still plenty of room to go. I mean, household formation is only, what, 1.2 million, 1.250 million, so I think there is a lot of room to go yet. And as far as service increases versus decreases that trend has been positive now for a year, right. So, all signs are really good there. So, again, that is one of our best businesses. So as we see broader recovery, we're going to see that in small container, we're going to see that in MSW landfill, two of our higher margin businesses that are going to continue to push us toward that 30% margin that we know is at some point achievable, so.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then Chuck's comment of 20 basis points to 30 basis points is the garbage company and then the 10 basis points is commodities. That 20 basis points to 30 basis points turns into 25 basis points to 35 basis points to 30 basis points to 35 basis points is what's happening, right. I mean, is that the way to think about it as I look out in 2018, into 2019 and 2020 if this pattern keeps holding?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's fair. I mean, we...","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","We believe that we're going to continue to see margin expansion over the course of the next several years, because of all of the factors, Michael, that we talked about including the increase in the volumes that we're seeing in small container business.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So to think about it \u2013 think about the comments, right. So, we give you volume. We give you price. We split it by market vertical. But don't forget about all the other metrics we gave you about improving engagement, improving Net Promoter Score, improving driver turnover stats, improving safety.","All of those other underlying metrics are all pointing in the right direction. So, all these investments we're making in creating Republic Way and working on the team and all these other things we're doing in pricing tools and so forth, all of that's taken hold. OneFleet, as I talked about with Tyler, all those things will have additional upside as well as a broader and more positive economic outlook.","So, we feel really good about the underlying trends. We feel really good about the rational industry. And we feel good about what 2017 and 2018 can look like, although we're certainly not giving 2018 guidance today, Michael.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. And not to mention, what's happened in the \u2013 with CPI and how we're going to get a bump-up in our pricing second half of this year and then what we might be able to print here in terms of CPI in 2017 and how that will impact the second half of 2018.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, remember right and we mentioned that we don't get the full benefit of the CRC again until 2018. And while we've been working really well and the team has been very successful in moving to the alternative index, as CPI rises, that's just a natural lift across the pretty big part of our business. We get back to now a very fair escalator, very quickly if we get that CPI lift. So, that's another thing that'll trend in our favor we think over the next couple of years based on everything we're seeing.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then if I could squeeze the next one in. The capital spending assumes growth for your win of the zones in Los Angeles?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. It does.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","That's correct.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","That's correct.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And it's ratable through the year, right. You're ramping at the pace of full absorption?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","More or less. The spend for that contract \u2013 it might be more weighted towards second half of the year, but pretty close to half now.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Congrats on the numbers.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Box at KeyBanc.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Joe.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So just quickly on the energy services side, I guess is it fair to say that the 25 basis points of contribution is all volume driven? Are you guys starting to see some price improvement? And then maybe just from a high level, if you could just talk to some of the changes that you guys have made at this business. I'm sure you guys have changed the mix since you bought in. You've probably added some muscle. So maybe just a little color on what the business looks like today from the margin standpoint versus when you bought it?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","All right. Well, as far as the mix goes, remember when we bought it, it was primarily infrastructure business, disposal, TRD, very small part of that business was transportation. And so the mix is largely the same. We have added some capacity in around disposal, which has been one of the reasons that the business is building. And as far as what we've done to the business, we've made it more efficient. We've made it operate better. We've improved turn times to facilities. We're trying to be the facility of choice, those kind of things. We've brought some of the Republic Way concepts, as you could imagine, operations into that business.","So the team proved very quickly that we could operate the business and frankly operate the business better than it was being operated. So that gave me a lot of confidence. The rest of the noise is just about the market, but we never saw real price erosion in the business, and that's primarily because we bought good assets in good geographies. And of course, the Permian really is performing well.","So as volumes come up, those volumes are going to come in at a higher margin, which is, it's going to behave very much as like our solid waste business does. We got the assets, we got the people in place, and we could handle a lot more volume without adding a lot of other cost, we'll just basically take advantage of the operating leverage. So that's what we see for 2017.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sure. Sure. Do you think you could actually see some price improvement in 2017 or is that a little out of reach?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","No. I think look, we believe in supply and demand economics. It works very well in our business and we're very well situated again geographically. So that, as markets improve, should give us some pricing power as well.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Great.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Next question is from Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon, guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Al.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Al.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hope you're doing well.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Doing great.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good. One of the follow-up on the energy services side. So is that something you're comfortable with looking at expansion or deploying some capital at the right price?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, we've done a little bit of that Al. Not in a huge way, but done a little bit of it. And again, we're comfortable with the business. I guess what I'm saying we've run the assets well. We got a really good team on the ground there. So I feel good about that. It's just really a matter of where is the opportunity and is the opportunity in the right location. It's really not that much different than the solid waste business. We want to have good market position and so for the right opportunity we could, but after even saying that, it's still just a really small piece of our overall business, it's less than 1% of our business and it will never be a really, really big piece of our business around here. But it doesn't make it not important, we'll just be opportunistic if we can be.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","And this is not another platform acquisition out there, Al, that's available to us and not only that we'd be interested in that, what we're looking to do really is to tuck-in other assets around our existing infrastructure.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","That's correct.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","That's very helpful. Love to hear that. Let me try this question and see how we go, but we are shooting for on a Thursday afternoon. How long or how much more and this maybe you can broaden this out to someone other than RSG if you'd like. How much further do we have to go through on this regrettable losses and in terms of purging the business. Maybe said differently, why don't we get rid of the business that's not profitable, is there a fear of vertical integration, is it market specific and therefore you can't do it all at once. What's holding us back?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, there is a couple of things. First there is contractual obligations, right and so we don't break agreements with customers; even if we are in a situation we don't like, we do our best to negotiate our way through it. We never just walk away from a customer when we've got a contractual obligation, so that's first.","Second, we think very strategically about our business, and so the decision to move away from some of the broker business is a strategic decision and we know what that \u2013 we think we believe or we think we know what that outcome will do for our business overall. So we're doing that in a kind of a ratable, methodical way over time, it just makes sense. So we put a lot of thought into it, we maybe at this for another year or two, and then it will be through it, and at the same time, because we have the capture tools in place, because we have PBS training in place, because we have better controls, we're making better decisions at the point of sale, we will be finding our way into this business again, because we have a control point in our National Accounts Group, a portal, if you will, that puts controls on which type of third-parties we choose to do business with or not. Again, we won't find ourselves in this situation again. And so we're just doing it in a methodical way and in a way that supplements our strategy, doesn't hurt our strategy. So that's as simply as I can put it. I guarantee it makes sense and it's the right way to go.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Yeah. No, I wasn't questioning that. I was just trying to appreciate not having to run out of business, Don. Sometimes we don't appreciate some of those things. Shifting gears to \u2013 are you able to add anymore color on the LA business that was one, zones, as they are more forthcoming?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","No, again, let me just say this, the main point, I think that should be important to people is when this opportunity developed, we certainly put a lot of time and effort, we had a great team on the ground, we got great relationships there in LA, we ended up protecting and actually expanding our previous market share there. As you know we've got great assets in the market, we're the only company that has a landfill in the County of LA, and so we want to make sure we continue to find a way to utilize our vertical integration opportunity and advantage there, which we've done. We are happy with the zones we have, and again we actually did a little better than the market share we had and it's going to be accretive to the business. So we are excited to get started with the city there, and I think it's going to be a great outcome overall.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Are you able to \u2013 with the guidance that you provided, I assume this is included in there?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","It is included, but you can imagine, right, the things starts kind of halfway through the year, it's a lot of startup costs. So it's not going to do much for us in 2017 by the time we get it all sorted out and stood up, we'll see some more benefit from it in 2018.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Well, I'll look for the trucks. Thanks.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","All right, man.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","See you.","Operator","At this time there appear to be no further questions.

Through the team's relentless execution of our plan in the first quarter we grew revenue, expanded EBITDA margins, produced over 30% growth in earnings and free cash flow per share and returned essentially all of our free cash flow to shareholders.","The solid waste business performed exceptionally well in the quarter and contributed 140 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion over the prior year. Within the solid waste business, we saw strong operating leverage in the disposal, small-container and large-container businesses. Additionally, as expected, SG&A as a percent of revenue decreased 20 basis points and landfill operating costs as a percent of revenue also decreased.","Overall, our first quarter results position us well to achieve our full year EPS and free cash flow guidance. Additional highlights of the quarter include: adjusted EPS of $0.74, an increase of 35%; adjusted free cash flow of $356 million, an increase of 48%. EBITDA increased $45 million or 7% over the prior year. EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 28.8% despite a 160 basis point headwind from recycling.","Core price was 3.8% and average yield was 2.2%, both in line with our expectations. Average yield was strongest in our small-container and large-container businesses. A majority of these customers are in open markets, where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform. We now have approximately $570 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index or a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater for the annual price adjustment.","These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have historically run higher than CPI. Volumes increased 2% and exceeded our expectations. We invested $26 million in tuck-in acquisitions in the first quarter and another $53 million in April for a total investment of $79 million to-date. And, finally, we returned $350 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Before turning the call over to Chuck, I'd like to make a few comments on our recycling business. First, it's important to keep in mind that our recycling processing and sale of commodities business is only 4% of total revenue. Second, despite a $0.06 headwind in the first quarter from lower commodity prices and higher labor costs on our sorting lines, we still outperformed relative to our expectations, given the strength of our solid waste business.","Third, we continue to believe recycled commodity prices will increase from April levels and have already begun to see clear evidence of this in the last couple of weeks. And, finally, we continue to make progress moving to a fee-based pricing model with a more equitable risk sharing arrangement. We believe the current situation in China will serve as a catalyst in transitioning our municipal customers to this more durable model. Our customers have told us recycling is important to them and we remain committed to de-risking this core service offering and ensuring its sustainability for generations to come.","I'll now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our financial results. Chuck?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Don. First quarter revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $129 million or 5.6% over the prior year. The increase in revenue includes internal growth of 3.8% and acquisitions of 1.8%. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, average yield increased 2.2% and was in line with our expectations. Average yield in the collection business was 2.4% which includes 2.6% in the small-container business, 2.6% in the large-container business and 2.1% in the residential business.","Average yield in the post collection business was 1.7% which includes landfill MSW of 2.2%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.8%. Core price consisted of 4.6% in the open market and 2.5% in the restricted portion of our business.","The second component of internal growth is total volume which increased 2% over the prior year. Volumes increased 1.9% in our large container business and as expected were essentially flat in our small container business. Small container volumes included the 90 basis point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would've increased 80 basis points.","Volumes decreased 2.7% in the residential business. The decrease was expected and resulted from not renewing certain contracts that fell below our return criteria. The post collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 11.1%. Landfill volume increased 12.7% which included C&D of 5.7% and special waste of 35.9%. The strong growth in special waste exceeded our expectations and was due to a large project completed during the quarter. MSW volumes decrease 1.1% versus the prior year.","The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees which increased 50 basis points. The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.02 in the first quarter from $2.57 in the prior year, an increase of 18%. The current average diesel price is $3.16 per gallon. The increase in the cost of diesel was partially offset by CNG tax credits. The credits contributed $0.04 to EPS and included a $0.03 benefit in cost of operations and a $0.01 benefit in the tax provision.","The next component, energy services revenue, increased 40 basis points. The growth in energy services revenue is primarily due to increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin where we continue to be well-positioned. And the final component of internal growth is commodity revenue which decreased 1.3%. The decrease in commodity sales revenue primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 31% to $112 per ton in the first quarter from $162 per ton in the prior year.","Now, I'll discuss changes in margin. In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin increased 30 basis points to 28.8% versus 28.5% in the prior year. This included 140 basis points of expansion from the solid waste business and 50 basis points of expansion from the CNG tax credit, partially offset by 160 basis point headwind from recycling. As a reminder, the 30 basis points of margin expansion does not include the benefit from adopting the new revenue accounting standard in 2018.","First quarter 2018 interest expense was $95 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5% and was lower than expected due to the CNG tax credit and unanticipated federal and state tax refunds. The refunds provided an approximate $0.02 benefit to EPS. Adjusted EPS was $0.74, an increase of $0.19 or 35% over the prior-year. EPS included a $0.12 benefit from tax reform. Excluding the benefit from tax reform, EPS increased 13% versus the prior-year.","First quarter adjusted free cash flow was $356 million, an increase of 48% versus the prior year. The growth in free cash flow was due to strong growth in EBITDA and a favorable benefit from the timing of working capital and CapEx. Next, we returned $350 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This included 3.5 million shares repurchased for approximately $236 million.","And, finally, as Don mentioned earlier, we remain comfortable with our full year 2018 EPS and free cash flow guidance, given our first quarter results, the underlying strength of our solid waste business, and our ability to continue to effectively manage our costs.","Now I will turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you, Chuck. To conclude, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance. Strong solid waste fundamentals, together with relentless operational execution, resulted in double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow. This performance keeps us well-positioned to achieve our full year goals.","Before opening the call to questions, I would like to congratulate Republic team for being named to the first annual Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list and recognized by Ethisphere as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for the second year in a row. These awards serve as external validation of strong ethical culture that we are building at Republic, which includes conducting our business with the highest levels of integrity and developing sustainable business practices to enhance long-term value creation.","At this time, operator, we're going to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first questioner today will be Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just on the pricing side. Don, maybe if you want to just touch on where do you think going forward you see the most opportunity on pricing? Is it on commercial collection or is it on landfill or is it simply higher inflation is going to lift all boats going forward?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Good question, Hamzah. There's a couple of things. One, CPI is on the rise, right? So, CPI has been (15:01) the last few years. As you know, we've been kind of punished by this compounding headwind of low CPI on that big $2.5 billion book of business. So, two things are happening there. One, as I said in my notes, we've got about $570 million of that $2.5 billion now converted to an alternate index or a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. So, that's happening. You're seeing that layer into the business now, so you'll continue to see the year-over-year benefit of that. And we're going to continue to go for more as you've seen every quarter we've improved that number.","Second, CPI is on the rise. I mean people are now expecting, what, 2.5% CPI for the year. So, as we get into the second half of the year we'll see some of those contracts that are still tied to CPI start to roll over at a higher price. So that's great. The open market has been a very good place for pricing for us now for a number of quarters. We exited the year real strong. That's continuing now in the beginning part of the year. We think that's holding up fine. And, frankly, historically, as CPI rises, open market pricing stays strong and frankly improves. So that's a pretty good sign.","Lastly, landfill pricing is still a little weak, frankly. I would have expected the landfill pricing would have rose a little faster than maybe it had. Because, again, just the high cost of landfills today, the higher cost of leachate, some of the costs that we're seeing in the business we need to revisiting our landfill prices and see what we can do there, starting to have those conversations with our municipal customers. Again, most of our third-party volume in the landfills comes through municipal customers. And, again, they're tied to these long-term contracts that have been again subject to that lower CPI environment.","So as we're having renewal discussions with those customers, we're introducing some of these higher cost that we're facing. So we'd like to expect over the longer-term a better pricing there. But, overall, we're seeing pricing across the board. Again, we've got good tools. We use our Capture tool. All of our salespeople are equipped with their tablets. They're all using the system properly. Frankly, pricing churn continue to be a great story for us. It's actually come down a little bit this quarter. We're seeing a lower defection. So that's helping to drive price and kind of all systems go. There's still some room to run here.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Great. And just a follow-up question on just acquisitions. You mentioned $79 million year-to-date investment. You still have a target of $100 million to $150 million. But at the same time, the industry seems very bullish on M&A. Some of your competitors have closed significantly above their target in terms of deal flow. Is there anything you would sort of comment on in terms of RSG's focus is more return of cash or maybe there's antitrust issues in doing larger deals? Any kind of color you want to share on acquisitions and how you think about those.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, sure. I would start off by saying that the pipeline is still robust. We're seeing a lot of deal flow. We're getting a look at a lot of good, high-quality companies. The majority of the companies we're buying tend to be smaller. So the multiples we're paying are still in that 4.5 to kind of 5.5 range, very comfortable multiples. When we buy something a little bit bigger, the multiples get a little higher. You start buying more real property, infrastructure, permits, things that you have to spend a little bit more money for.","I think the activity we've seen out there, I think, maybe some of the other companies have made some bigger purchases than we have this year. I would tell you that we were in the hunt on a couple of those, so we're well aware of them. But maybe it was a better fit for somebody else in their market. So they were willing to pay a bit more than we were, just because it fit their system better or maybe they needed something more than we did. As I always say, there tends to be natural buyer in these deals. And when we're the natural buyer, and we've got relationships and it fits our business, we think we can get good deals at the right multiples. So we're very focused on returns.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next questioner today will be Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Please go ahead.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Hey. Good afternoon. Just a couple quick ones. I realized your practice is to update guidance midway through the year, but just \u2013 obviously did a nice job offsetting the impact of recycling in the quarter. Just can you give us some view \u2013 can you continue doing that? So in other words are you still at least comfortable with the guidance you have put out there?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. So I'm going to give you some color and then I'll let Chuck give you a little more on the numbers side. We've been saying, I think, a lot of people writing that April really was expected to be sort of the floor \u2013 the bottom this year. That's proving out to be true. As I said in my comments over these last couple weeks, we've seen price start to bounce.","The reality is the inventories in China are very low. We actually mentioned this last week when we spoke at WasteExpo. Our team went over to China a few weeks back and met with our mills there. Normally, they have about 30 to 60 days of material inventory. They were sitting at about 10 days of inventory. Normally, they have a fair amount of inventory in-transit, in ocean-going vessels from port-to-port. There's very little if any in-transit.","So, this is very sort of what I would call sort of simple ECON 101, supply and demand economics. At some point, they need to make paper. And they're buying a lot of raw pulp. They're paying eight times what they used to pay. So, we think that's the reason that prices are starting to come up. Chuck can give you kind of a color of where we were at the beginning the year, where we were in April and where we think the year heads up for us.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, sure. For the quarter, average price was $112 a ton. What we saw in April was closer to $105. And as we go forward, we think that the average would be closer to $115. So, Corey, to your point, we're able to more than offset the headwind associated with commodities in Q1. And right now, we're estimating that we're going to be able to do the same thing for the rest of the year with commodities at $115 a ton, that being a little bit of a headwind for us based upon our original guide, but being able to offset that through continued outperformance in the solid waste business.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Okay. Thank you. And then the second question I had is on the volume side where you are intentionally shedding some broker volumes. I think I'm hearing that the underlying kind of small-container business is strong. So can you give us a sense like when you start to \u2013 is there a part when you anniversary shedding those volumes or is that kind of a continual thing? And as you anniversary that, do you think you can get to even higher volume growth levels than you're at now?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. So if we take out what we call non-regrettable losses, right, our volume would have been 100...","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","110.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","...110 basis points, so kind of in line with our expectations. As it relates specifically to broker, by the end of the year we'll have maybe only $100 million or so left of broker business to shed. That's a little lumpy if it happens. But we're cutting through it and again by the end of the year we'll be \u2013 I was saying year of the end. But that will probably happen \u2013 that last little bit will probably happen over two or three years.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","All right. I will turn it over. Thank you.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Great.","Operator","And the next questioner today will be Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. If I could follow up just a little bit to clarify. So from this point forward, we should go \u2013 if we had $135 as our assumption for the cycle and go take that down to $115 for 2Q through the remainder of the year which is about $0.08 of incremental headwind and you feel that given the power of the first quarter and it was great quarter in garbage that you can make that up. Is that the way...","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. That's right, Michael. Yeah. On average, $115 the remainder of the year. Your math is right, it's about $0.08. And we feel like we can make that up through the outperformance in the solid waste business.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And so to that end, you exceeded your own budget \u2013 I mean your own guidance on volumes. So are we to look for \u2013 we should walk volume up as part of the \u2013 as we think about modeling? You had \u2013 $2.25 was your reported price for the year, but your volume assumption was going to be zero to 0.25 a point. So, how do I think about volume in the guidance at this point?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Is that...","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. So first quarter volume \u2013 yeah, Michael, first quarter volume was very strong because of special waste. And obviously we'll take that into consideration when we do a broader update of guidance as we always do in Q2.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","But where you're going with that, right? Volume is good. I would say it's strong. We're seeing strong volume in C&D landfill. We're seeing strong volume in large-container. We're seeing strong volume in temp, good housing market. I mentioned we're seeing lower customer defection, right? Our customer defection actually fell below 7% for the first time in our history, okay. So, all of those things factor into volume, Michael, as you know. So, as Chuck said, as we get through May and June and understand our sort of normal seasonality on how things are coming back we're going to come back to you in the second quarter call and have a clear picture for you.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Fair enough but I'm interpreting it correctly. I get that you're not changing guidance...","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Directionally, you are correct.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And the price seems to have a little bit better momentum as well. So that's the other part of it. If the volume trends that good, that gives you that much more room to push on the leverage on price.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, look, I've always said, when organic volume growth is good, pricing goes along with that. When organic volume growth dips and goes negative, that's when pricing gets a little squirrelly, right? So if volume's growing, organic's growing, housing's growing, all those things that we're seeing in the broader macro are good, we think volume holds up, and it's a pretty good story for this year and pricing comes right alongside of it.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So on the recycling issue in your following comment, which I hope the industry is able to take advantage of this and fix this. From a fundamental standpoint, I look at this, what's going on, as we clear the deck in 2018 and 2019, whatever the lower number is, is a slower number, and we just plow on with good garbage in the E&P business. And this is the debt-clearing year. How long do think, though, it will take to get the customer to agree this has to change?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, let me help you.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Because it's been really slow, historically.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Okay. So I'm going to burn a little time on this answer, okay. So this is really important for everybody to try to understand, everyone listening on the call. We make two assumptions, and we would posit them as facts. The first fact is customers want to recycle, okay. Part B of that first fact is customers are showing us that they're willing to pay for recycling. I'll come back to that. The second important fact that we posit is that paper packaging demand is not decreasing. In fact, most people would argue it's on the increase.","So recycling, there's a business here, right. People want to do it, and there's a demand for paper packaging. Most of what we recycle is fiber. So, I mean, the lion's share of it is fiber. So we receive recycling through three channels or three lanes. The first inbound lane comes in our open market collection business. So these are frontload railroad commercial customers where we put out three yarders, four yarders, eight yarders, right.","In that business, we've reported quarter-after-quarter that we've been increasing the price we charge for commercial recycling in our small-container business, started out $0.28, $0.30 or 3% of trash rates. Now it's 90%-plus of trash rates. Okay. So customers are saying I'm willing to pay for that because I want to do it. So we've corrected that space. Customers are voting with their wallets and we haven't lost any volume and we're making money in that business. We're making an appropriate return so we can continue to offer that important service to our customers.","Second lane that we bring material into our company is through our recycling facilities, right. This is where third-parties who don't own their own manufacturing or processing capacity but they have their collection trucks. These are primarily cities. So cities collecting waste from the curb and some other competitors or smaller haulers bring us material to our facilities. In those cases, in that lane, the lion's share, 85% of those contracts, of that volume, now is coming in at what we would call have a fee-based structure or a fair share arrangement. We're no longer holding all the risk. Now, we give away some of the upside but we're getting a certain or a certainty of a return on that revenue. So those are the first two lanes.","The third lane is the biggest and it's most difficult. And that is municipalities where we go out and collect with our trucks and either bring them to our own facilities or to third-party facilities. And this is the same group of people who we're trying to move away from a CPI index to a alternative index. So, you see the results we're having there. We've moved now well over 20% of that business to a fair share arrangement or an alternative index. So, now we're having that same conversation with those customers which is going to take some time, but in my prepared remarks this chaos, if you will, this crisis, if you will, in China is the catalyst to fix this business.","And if I look at the first two lanes, those first two customer groups, they've already demonstrated customers understand the economics and they're willing to pay for it because they want sustainability. They want recycling. So, we just have to do the work. And then, frankly, we're built for that. We get up every day. We pick up the garbage. We get up every day and \u2013 pardon the football analogy \u2013 but we run the ground game.","And customer's going to have to understand if you want to recycle, it's not free. This stuff is not worth gold, okay. We've got residual issues, too much trash in the garbage. We've got glass which is a contaminant at some point. We've got materials that don't have value that we have to deal with, okay. The fiber has value and has a market. So, these are the discussions we're having with customers, and it's going to take some time but we're very determined.","And as I've said a few times now, it's kind of a perverse statement, but frankly in one way, I kind of welcome this China chaos because it gives us the platform that we need to go have the conversation that we frankly probably should have been having 10 years ago, okay. So, it's going to be a good business. It is a good business in some markets, and some markets are lagging. So, again, as we talk about return on invested capital, it can be a better business on that basis than the landfill business, than the solid waste business. And it is a growing segment. It's a growing waste stream.","So, we want to get in front of the growth, but we're not going to do it for practice. So you'll see the returns improving in this business. You'll see the story change over time. And that's all I've got to say today. But that's the reality we're living in. And our team is poised to go out there and make it happen. We've got a strong team here and they're getting good results in other ways. And I would say, lastly, that we've seen these issues before in solid waste. When fuel became volatile in 2004, we implemented a fuel recovery fee which is a very fair way to deal with fuel cost with customers.","It goes up and down based on fuel markets, so customers are treated fairly. We see CPI which has become an unfair index. We're going to a fair index and customers are coming along with us. And now we have to deal with this last sort of issue \u2013 this sort of last frontier of volatility in our business. And we're going to be through that and it may take a few years to do. But we're going to see progress. And how did I do, Michael? Are you still there?","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. No, I'm here.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Okay.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Well, so somehow I'm supposed to work in some corny analogy about football games are one but passing. So, on the passing side if you're \u2013 I don't know how I'm drawing this altogether this way. So we'll scratch that and just go. Your $570 million out of $2.5 billion you did in about 30 months. Is that about the way we should think of about the pace of being able to fix the 80% of the recycling...","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. I don't know. Let us keep going on it and we'll see in a couple quarters. But we're determined. Again, we're pretty good at picking up trash and recycling. We don't need practice doing it for free, right?","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","And then my final word on it and I'm sort of the master of the obvious here, right, but my team's heard it a thousand times. Sustainability, my customers, is not possible without profitability. Organizations like ours cannot invest in sustainable practices, in recycling unless there is a return that we can count on. And that's the nature of the beast. That's what we believe and that's what you'll see happening in our business. And anybody who doesn't believe that it's kind of a fool's errand, so.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Okay.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And the only thing we care about is we don't want to see the price recover too fast so the customer won't come to the table. So, at $115 that still leaves you room to argue, hey, you got to fix this?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, even if it goes to $200, we've got to fix it because here's what we know. It will go down again.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. Okay.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Okay. So, again this is just \u2013 we've been doing a lot of other great work in the company over the last seven or eight years. We've been busy on a lot of good things like One Fleet and all the other good stuff and Capture and PBS. And so we've been doing a lot of great things to make the company better. This is the great thing we're going to be doing over the next couple of years.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And the next questioner today will be Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first off, I mean EBITDA margin is up 30 basis points year-over-year despite a headwind on recycling. I know you guys aren't updating your tide-ins right now and the components, but is there anything we should be aware of, the cadence of margins throughout the year? Is there anything that should stick out? And with that, I mean the landfill operating cost, I think, fell like 5% year-over-year. This was clearly an issue last year. Can you just provide us an update there? Is that something that's like sustainable and should be kind of the run rate going forward for the year? Thanks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, think about some of the major components, right? We told you last year that SG&A was going to \u2013 some of the SG&A investments we made we're going to anniversary. We're seeing that, right. So we're very much in control of our SG&A spend, right. So we've got a pretty good handle on that. So we made those investments last year, the year before. Now they're coming down just as we said.","We told you last year we were doing some additional work at some of the landfills related to some various permit issues and some leachate issues. We're coming through that. That's going to start working its way down. We've already seen that in the first quarter. So we've got a good handle on that. I mentioned One Fleet earlier. Our fleet costs are solid. Our labor costs are in line. The core solid waste business is running well. The operating team is doing a fantastic job. And, again, growth, right, we're seeing pretty consistent growth, positive sort of economic factors across the portfolio. So, yeah, we think it's sustainable.","And over the long-term, we still aren't backing away from 30% EBITDA margins because we're going to see that improve. We're going to see our conversion to a better index continue. We're going to see improvement in this recycling business. We've got the courage and stamina to do what we need to do there. And, again, we've got customer willingness to pay on our side. And then we're improving the products. We're improving the quality. We're improving service. We're improving fleet reliability. As I've said, our defection has come down. All those kind of things, a lot of really good stuff going on here and someday we'll want to talk about recycling so much but let's not. What else you got, Michael?","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess I just wanted to follow up on that. I mean you mentioned obviously organic growth helps drive the pricing dynamics, but we're also seeing it driving investment back into the fleet. Your CapEx is up. Some of your suppliers to the industry have pretty big backlog. So I guess a big-picture question here. You guys are clearly adding some routes. Are you seeing anything in the open market the small mom-and-pops adding trucks or maybe too many trucks, the supply-demand balance of that with the open market?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","I would answer it this way. I think we're getting our fair share of the organic growth. And, again, we target our sales force toward customers that we think use some kind of a value equation in their thinking, people that like the idea of great service and solutions, and recycling those services in a broader suite of services. We don't expect to chase every account or have every new yard of growth, but we're getting our fair share. And as long as we're getting our fair share and maybe a little more because our products are strong and we're okay with that. Meanwhile, we're getting pricing to offset inflation, and that's an important factor of the overall story. So, nothing bad to report there.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great. Just my last question. I mean we saw industrial company last week (38:27). You kind of make a comment about peak or near peak. Clearly, it's a different type of industrial company business. It sounds like from what you're seeing on the volume side and with your different aspects of what you guys touch in the economy there's nothing that suggest to you that were any areas of the business that feel frothy to you or peak-ish in any way? Does it still feel like you have a runway ahead on a multiyear basis?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. So, simple answer is we think there's still room to run and we backed it up with some statistics. Why don't I let Chuck back it up with statistics because I've been doing all the talking? How is that?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","So, what we talk about is there being a 90% correlation to our volume growth, overall, to our company, in single-family housing starts, when you lag single-family housing starts by one year since we're late cycle, obviously. So as we look at single-family housing starts, the print for March was 1.3 million units on an annual basis. So it's been increasing slowly over time based on the experts that we talk to. We think there's nothing that will prevent us in getting back to a longer-term average of close to 1.4 million, 1.5 million units. There's also been a number of articles written recently that say that there is actually a lack of supply of new single-family housing throughout the United States. And they estimated that to be an additional 7.3 million units. So all of that in combination we would say that back to Don's point that there's still plenty of room to run here in this economy.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great. And then just lastly, I mean the special waste was really strong this quarter. You mentioned a big project. I was just wondering. Do you guys quantify that big project that you completed this quarter? And how does the pipeline look in special waste since I think that's one of the reasons why your volume outlook for the year was flat to up 25 bps?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So we've had a tremendous growth in special waste over the course of the last several quarters, close to a year now. To grow on top of 30% type of growth year-over-year is really hard for us to do. Like you had mentioned we had a really strong special waste job that occurred during the quarter that ended now. Looking forward, we still see some growth there. But I can't \u2013 to grow 30% on top of 30% is difficult to do. But what it does speak to though, right, this event work, it's a precursor to single-family housing starts and to development in general. So that's another indication that we think that the economy still has room to run.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks, guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","And the next questioner today will be Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thanks for taking the questions and a great quarter. I think free cash flow conversion this quarter really stood out. Historically, I'd say they tracked around 8% to 9% of revenue. Prior guidance probably implied something like 11% this year. But for 1Q, it was almost 15% of revenue, and I'm not sure if that's a high-water mark but it looks very impressive.","So can you comment on a couple of things here? First, you mentioned the working capital benefit. How to think about that maybe reversing over the course of the year? And second is again to one particular line item. It looks like the capping closure and post-closure expenditures were down pretty markedly at $7 million which is a much lower run rate than it had been in past quarters. Is that sort of $7 million the right run rate for the balance of 2018? Thanks.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. So a couple of questions there, the first one being the working capital. We think that that is timing and that will end up reversing kind of evenly throughout the rest of the year. Not really a permanent benefit, but more of a timing benefit. To your point on the capping in closure\/post-closure, that tends to be lumpy. Obviously, we don't cap until we need to, right. And so that will depend upon when we need to do the capping and also the weather to a certain extent. So it does tend to be a little lumpy, but we don't expect there to be a significant change in that cash expenditure year-over-year.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And you mentioned weather. Obviously, a strong quarter on a number of metrics, but I think most folks have been expecting a little bit of a weather-related headwind this year. So can you comment on (43:10) might have impacted any part of the business?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. So the weather ended up being a little bit of an offset. We had a lot of rain on the West Coast last year. And this year, we had a little bit of weather as you're aware on the East Coast. So, it tended to offset. So, we didn't see a real significant impact in the business overall this quarter because of weather.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one more. Really appreciate the adjustments on pro forma, so we can compare like-for-like. But the point I'm getting a bit confused on, if we look at the recycled commodity revenue line, your bookings are supposed to be moving year-over-year, I guess, down 3% to 4% when the commodity basket is obviously down a lot more. I'm sure part of this has to do with rev rec and the changes but could you just help us explain why the line didn't drop that much?","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Noah. This is Nicole. So, when you look at the supplemental schedules \u2013 and you kind of cut out a little bit, so hopefully I'm asking you a question. When you look at the revenue dollars, there wasn't a significant decrease in that because, if you recall, this time last year, we didn't have ReCommunity. So that kind of offsetting some of the decline in RSG legacy recycling commodity revenue. When you go to kind of the components of internal growth in there you refer to the 1.3% decline, again, that is more of a same-store legacy Republic Services. The impact of ReCommunity is down in the acquisition line.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","That's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And the next questioner today will be Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good afternoon. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Just wanted to follow up on some of the volume trends on the residential side and the small collection side. You mentioned some of the rationalizations or I guess the shedding of the broker business and some of the changes in contracts on the residential side. Just curious, does that change the margin structure of those two businesses and how should we think about that going forward?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. The business that we're shedding both on the small-container side and on the residential side...","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","...that's business that's regrettable. I mean it's non-regrettable that we're shedding that business. That's because it's at lower margins. So, part of the reason why we're doing that is because we didn't feel like we were getting an appropriate return on our investment. And what we've always said is that we're very much focused in on ROIC. So, obviously, shedding that work and then deploying those assets in other pieces of business that provide us with a better return obviously will help us enhance our margins.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Keep in mind that those are small moves, right, but they're directionally going to improve the margins over time. Keep in mind that when we're the incumbent in a residential contract, we know all that cost right down to the nth degree, right. So we're very aware when a contract is sort of not meeting our threshold returns and when a customer doesn't really value what we're doing.","And if we can't get the extensions at the right price or the right kind of built-in indexes or as we relate to recycling, we've got to move away from them. And we're having a good success rate in converting and increasing and extending contracts as well. Every now and then we run across one where we just can't get it done. And the good news is the team is encouraged to walk away from that business and go find another customer who wants to value great service.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. Great. That's good to hear. And just on the cost side, I mean, some companies seem to have some difficulties in transportation costs and labor costs. I was just wondering how you're thinking about that. Is that potentially an issue going forward or something that you're keeping an aware of? Thanks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, it's certainly something we think about. We spend a lot of time, effort, energy talking about, thinking about, working on employee engagement at Republic. So our employee engagement rates are at all-time highs. Our turnover has been flattish year-over-year. We think our employee turnover is best-in-class. And even in light of a good or even an improving economy where you might lose more people, we're actually holding our own quite nicely. So we're spending more and more effort in just making Republic Services a great place to work.","We think as it relates to our front-line people, truck drivers appreciate our One Fleet initiative, having reliable, safe trucks. Our techs enjoy working in a shop where we take fleet seriously. Our professional salespeople like the tools that we've created for them. Again, we're working on the work environment at the facilities. As I said last quarter, we're going to spend about $100 million over the next few years improving front-line facilities, locker rooms, training rooms, break rooms, those kind of things.","So we put a lot of effort into just creating the best work environment, and we've got a number of external agencies and experts that have given us some acknowledgement and some accolades around that. But it's something we take really seriously. So it doesn't mean that we won't be affected by things to come, but I think we're ahead of the curve.","Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. Okay. That's great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next questioner today will be Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey. I just had a quick follow-up for Chuck. Chuck, do you know what your updated tax rate is in your guidance given Q1 was lower? Is it still 27% or has that changed? Thanks.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, it is, Hamzah. It's still 27%.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","Hamzah, just to clarify, 27% for the remainder of the year. So, the full year average would be closer to 26%. Just to clarify.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hamzah said everybody else got four questions, so why don't you ask another?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","That's his fourth.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Hamzah.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next questioner today will be Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in here.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Tyler.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, Chuck, just real quick. It's a little unclear, but was the $0.04 CNG tax credit contemplated in the guidance from last quarter?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","No, it wasn't.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So we...","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","If you remember that was part of the budget reconciliation package that came out a couple of days after our earnings call.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, do we tack on $0.04 to the guide or is it used to absorb some of the recycling?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. That's what absorbed the recycling during the period. Keep in mind we had about a $0.06 headwind from recycling during the period. So, we had about $0.04 of a benefit from CNG, and then another $0.02 benefit from the tax refunds that I've talked about. So, that's what offset the recycling.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then I apologize, but can you go back over the margin math? So, are you saying that if you exclude the tax credit, ReCommunity dilution and recycling prices, basically solid waste margins were up 140 basis points, is that right?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, right. So, solid waste up 140 basis points. The CNG tax credit, as I have mentioned, was about 50 basis points. And then recycling operations, that was a negative, a headwind of 160 basis points. So, the net of all of that is the 30 basis points that we called out.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Perfect. And then I do want to kind of go back to the transportation question. But one line item we've been watching pretty close is the subcontractor hauling costs. And I think you guys saw a pretty pronounced squeeze this quarter. I think some of your peers have as well. I know it's a pretty granular question, but can you guys talk about what the expectation there is? I mean, transportation costs don't look like they're abating anytime soon in my humble opinion. But should we expect that that is a margin headwind for the rest of the year?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","No. No. Not necessarily. So what we saw in the first quarter was a little bit of a spike in our transportation subcontract costs because of business mix. So there is a little bit higher national accounts subcontract work that was performed that was in the mix and just a mix of the business kind of in general and we're not necessarily saying that that's a trend that's going to continue.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Also, Tyler, a large group of those waste moves, if you will, we've got long-term contracts with stable providers. And so, we're in pretty good shape there.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. Okay. And then maybe my last one, I don't know if you can parse this out. But how much did the shutting of the broker business help margins, solid waste specifically?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Tyler, I don't have that at my fingertips.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","As Don mentioned before, it's small relative to the rest of the business. But, incrementally, as we continue to do this over time, it is going to improve our margins.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. Okay. All right. Thank you.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Tyler.","Operator","And the next questioner today will be Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just following on Tyler's question there, just to make sure I have it clear. The energy credit was, obviously, about $14 million benefit to EBITDA. And we shouldn't think about that recurring in the future, right?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. It was about $15 million. That's right.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","That was a one-time benefit that actually pertained to 2017.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. And it just wasn't included because the tax law clarification didn't come out until after you gave your original guidance. Is that right?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","That was part of the budget reconciliation package that came out a couple of days after we had already had our earnings call. Correct.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Okay. Thanks for clarification there. And then not to belabor the recycling point too much, but just the contaminant levels that China is trying to get to. I know that's a big obstacle to try and get down to 50 basis points of contamination. Just wondering as you've changed your operations, and you're incurring these additional costs, how close are you getting to that level? And sort of related to that, are you seeing \u2013 sort of what we've seen is maybe some different markets develop in recycled fiber where some higher quality stuff like OCC number 12 or DLK is trading at a little bit of a higher price than some of the more commodity grades. Is that sort of what you're seeing too? And is that what you're sort of referencing when you say you're starting to see some signs of uplift on recycled fibers?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. That's fair. So, with OCC, we're doing a pretty job. With the mixed paper and some other grades, it's a little bit tougher as you can imagine. But, again, we've opened up other outlets. So, we're moving our export material to a number of other places now that we didn't previously. But again, ultimately, China has got to figure out that they've got to make paper. And they have to decide whether they're going to deal with some of this contaminant or they're going to keep buying pulp and chopping up trees.","So we're just going to keep working it out. But again, it's supply and demand. And we're already starting to see the bounce, as Chuck talked about, the rates we experienced in Q1 where the April dip was and now we're seeing a bounce already, the last part of April and here in early May. So we're pretty confident it's going to come back as we've said in line with that $115 number. And our team's doing a great job getting the material moved. And again, we threw a little extra labor in Q1 to do a little better job at cleaning up. But I think it's going to come back for us.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Just one last housekeeping one, appreciate the restated 2017 numbers. Just was wondering why the \u2013 it looks like the adjusted EBITDA was a little bit lower than what we had in our model as the reported numbers from last year. Any reason why the accounting change would modestly lower the EBITDA in 2017?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So it was 110-basis-point impact from the revenue recognition change. So I'm not really sure why that would be different than what you had in your models.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll follow up with that later. Appreciate it.","Operator","And at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call over back to you for your closing remarks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you, William.

When events are scheduled, the dates, time and presentations are posted on our website. Finally, I'd like to point out that in our 8-K filing we've included the table that reflects changes in average yield and volume as a percentage of total revenue by line of business.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.","Don Slager","Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong start to the year. We continue to realize the benefits of executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, which includes strengthening our market position, attracting and retaining the best people, enhancing the customer experience to increase willingness to pay, and leveraging our scale and technology to drive additional efficiencies in our business.","As a result in the first quarter, both earnings and free cash flow are in line with our expectations. Through strong pricing, we were able to offset a $0.01 headwind from lower-than-anticipated recycle commodity prices. For the full year, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow guidance, assuming current economic conditions continue. The strong momentum in our business will enable us to offset the additional $0.06 headwind from lower-than-anticipated recycling commodity prices.","In the first quarter, we continued our balanced approach to capital allocation to increase long-term shareholder value. We invested $86 million in acquisitions. We sustained this momentum into the second quarter and have invested an additional $56 million for a total of $142 million of investment to date. This puts us on track to outpace our original acquisition guidance of $200 million. We now expect to invest approximately $300 million for the full year. During the quarter, we also returned $233 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","I'll now turn the call over to Jon to discuss our first quarter operating performance. Jon?","Jon Vander Ark","Thanks, Don. The pricing environment in the first quarter was strong. Total core price was 4.7% and average yield was 2.9% our highest pricing level in nearly a decade. We achieved this pricing, while also sustaining our all-time low customer defection rate below 7%. The progress we are making on key initiatives is contributing to our ability to increase prices and retain customers.","First, we continue to focus on providing superior service to our customers and making it easier for them to do business with us. Next, we are successfully converting customers from CPI based pricing to a waste related index or fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and continue to run higher than CPI. To date, $685 million of our $2.5 billion book of business has been converted.","Finally, we continue to discuss the true cost of recycling with our municipal collection customers as we renegotiate contracts. To date, we've secured price increases from approximately 21% of our municipal collection customers. In terms of dollars we have now reprised approximately 17% of our municipal recycling collection revenue.","Turning to volume. As anticipated total volume in the first quarter decreased 1.5% versus the prior year. We faced several known volume headwinds in the quarter. These included a difficult special waste comp in the prior year, continued shedding of work performed on behalf of brokers and non-regrettable contract losses in the residential collection business. Excluding these items, underlying volume growth was 60 basis points and in line with our expectations.","Next, our recycling processing and commodity sales revenue continued to experience downward pressure from further declines in recycled commodity prices. In the first quarter, our average recycled commodity price per ton decreased 17% to $93 down from $112 per ton in the prior year. Our April price per ton0 is estimated to be approximately $85.","We continue to take action to transform recycling into a more durable economically sustainable business model and more importantly we are making progress and seeing results. Through the end of the first quarter we secured price increases on approximately 34% of our recycling processing business.","Additionally, last year we rolled out an incremental recycling process charge to our open market collection customers to cover our increased costs. In the first quarter this contributed 35 basis points of pricing in addition to average yield. Combined, we achieved total pricing of 3.25%. These results demonstrate that our customers do value recycling and are willing to pay for the service.","Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 28.3%. We saw good operating leverage in the business, particularly in maintenance and labor. Both of these costs as a percentage of revenue decreased versus the prior year.","Our maintenance expense continues to benefit from our One Fleet standardized maintenance program and our labor expense is benefiting from our focus on process and routing efficiencies, as well as our efforts to attract and retain the best people.","In the first quarter, our industry-leading turnover decreased versus the prior year. Given the tight labor market this is a true testament to the culture we are building here at Republic.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail.","Chuck Serianni ","Thanks Jon. First quarter revenue was approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $43 million or 1.8% over the prior year. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong pricing across our collection, disposal and recycling processing businesses.","Adjusted EBITDA was $699 million, and adjusted free cash flow was $349 million, both in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 28.3% in line with our full year guidance of 28.3% to 28.5%.","As expected EBITDA margin decreased 50 basis points versus the prior year due to known headwinds. These headwinds included the expiration of C&D tax credits and a decrease in high-margin special waste volume due to the anniversary of a large event-driven project.","We also continued to maintain our strong liquidity position and leverage within our optimal range of two and a half to three times. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $8.5 billion of debt outstanding and $1.7 billion of additional borrowing capacity available under our credit facilities.","Interest expense in the first quarter was $100 million and included $11 million of non-cash amortization. In the first quarter tax related expense was a $0.01 headwind relative to expectations. The headwind was primarily due to higher-than-anticipated non-cash charges of $12 million, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate of 25%. For the full year, we continue to expect non-cash charges of $60 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 24% consistent with our original guidance.","Finally, as Don mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.23 to $3.28 and our adjusted free cash flow guidance of $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion, despite a $0.07 headwind from lower-than-anticipated recycled commodity prices. For purposes of reaffirming guidance, we've assumed recycled commodity prices remain at current levels for the remainder of the year.","At this time, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question today will be from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tyler Brown","Hi. Good afternoon.","Don Slager","Hi, Tyler. Good afternoon.","Tyler Brown","Hey, Congrats on the 2.9% yield. It seems like the acceleration was maybe a little faster than we were expecting. I was just curious if you could talk about a couple of things or initiatives that kind of allowed you to get to that 3% range so quickly. And just as a point of clarification, the 2.9% yield, is that exclusive of the 35 basis point yield held from the processing fee?","Don Slager","Yes. Tyler, its Don. It's a great catch, yes. The 2.9% excludes RPC. And so again, a great quarter in pricing. It underpins a couple of things. One, strong economy. As we've always said, when there's good organic growth in the market, pricing is better. Certainly, that's one thing.","Two, our tools, the team now has been using our capture tools and our -- a part of the selling message now for a couple of years, when Jon introduced those a couple of years ago, so those are well underway. Overall, rational backdrop competitively. We're really focused besides the RPC on recycling, we're really focused on extending contracts and changing contracts in and around recycling and Jon mentioned a lot of that in his prepared remarks. So it's a good backdrop. It's a good economic backdrop and we expect that to continue.","Tyler Brown","Okay. Very helpful. And then Chuck, I don't want to be super nitpicky here, but why is there such a large adjustment to free cash this quarter? I mean, it looks like there's maybe a $90 million adjustment versus say $30 million last year. I mean, normally, it's not a huge number, but this quarter really stood out. What was going on there?","Chuck Serianni","Yes. Adjustment to free cash flow, you're talking about in the non-GAAP, correct?","Tyler Brown","Yes.","Chuck Serianni","Yes, I've got to take a look at it Tyler.","Tyler Brown","Maybe -- yes.","Nicole Giandinoto","Tyler, well, I think what you're -- I don't know if this is what you're looking at, because I don't see a huge adjustment going from cash flow to adjusted free cash flow, but perhaps in the CapEx line you're seeing\u2026","Tyler Brown","Yes, that's exactly where it is Nicole. Yes, you're right there.","Nicole Giandinoto","Yes. That is just the timing of payments. So, basically, when we manage CapEx, we manage it on CapEx received, because that's easy for our business to understand. We budget that way. That's how we think about it. And then -- so basically, what happens is we took receipt of a lot of equipment, and then those will be paid in the next quarter. So you'll see it as a cash outflow in the statement cash flow in Q2.","Tyler Brown","Okay. Okay. That's helpful.","Chuck Serianni","And then look\u2026","Tyler Brown","Yes, sorry.","Chuck Serianni","Yeah, I was just going to say, it has -- it just has to do with the timing of the receipt of the trucks and this is adjustment that we make is no different than the adjustment that we make every quarter.","Tyler Brown","Okay. And then likewise why are you adding back this $12 million loss from unconsolidated equity method investments? I mean, it looks like it's below the line in the P&L. It's just -- I'm just curious on that as well.","Nicole Giandinoto","So Tyler, we -- the loss on unconsolidated equity method is really a tax-related item. So if you're looking at EBITDA, you want to add that back. Plus it is non-cash, so you want to add that back and when you adjust that free cash flow, you subtract down for cash taxes.","Tyler Brown","Okay.","Nicole Giandinoto","We're really actually paying the tax liability.","Tyler Brown","Okay. That is helpful. And then just lastly, maybe as we think about the EBITDA margins. So I think they were down maybe 50 basis points, but that's actually a bit better than we were expecting. But Chuck, I was wondering if you could quantify some of those big moving items such as the CNG tax credit, maybe recycling, maybe special waste.","Chuck Serianni","Yes. So the CNG tax credit was negative 60 basis points. At special waste, we talked about that. That was a negative 50 basis points. But then we had 60 basis points positive from just the solid waste business. The interesting thing here is that the recycling processing and sale of materials that was flat year-over-year, so that speaks to all of the efforts that we've put into place not just last year, but the efforts that continued here in Q1.","Tyler Brown","Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks.","Don Slager","Thanks Tyler.","Operator","The next question will be from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye","Hey good afternoon and thanks for the breakout in the filing of yield and volume trends by line of business. And just looking at that really strong volume in MSW again 6.5%. Maybe you can comment on any specific pockets of strength what you're seeing there?","Don Slager","Go ahead Jon.","Jon Vander Ark","Yes. We think it's broad -- it's broad-based. It's no individual side. It's not onetime events. We're getting some third-party volume that we didn't get last year. And we're seeing strong growth from current customers, so very positive turn.","Don Slager","Yes. I think overall again across the board nationally and as we've always pointed out right, when special waste is strong, when C&D is strong. That's just a continued good positive outlook for us for the economy.","Noah Kaye","Okay. Turning to M&A, you just -- the good activity so far in the year expectations for a higher spend than you guided. Can you just talk about kind of the factors behind that? Because obviously we've heard from some of the peers today, you're not alone that there is more spending across the board. But just what kind of environment are you seeing for deal activity that is making you go forward? And I assume your spending is still primarily weighted to tuck-ins, but just if you could clarify kind of the mix of your pipeline.","Don Slager","Sure. So one, we've always said that deal flow can be a little lumpy, right? It really depends on where these businesses are in their business life cycle. So if they have accummed larger deals that can drive the number here and there. We're seeing now for a number of quarters that the pipeline is robust and this is just sort of proof positive that it remains robust. We've had a couple of deals here lately that were maybe a little larger than our average. That's helping drive that. But we still have -- having spent almost $150 million year-to-date, we think we'll obviously -- we think we'll do $300 million for the full year. And that could go up a little bit depending on sort of timing right? So we are well positioned with our team. We've got great relationships with sellers.","And there are just frankly a lot of really attractive companies right now who are coming to a place in their life cycle who are thinking about monetizing their life's work et cetera et cetera. So we don't force deals. We don't do bad deals. We don't chase deals. We're looking still at companies that have a really high-quality revenue base, meaning a large percentage of reoccurring revenue, revenue under contract, small container business, permanent contractor roll-up business. We've been very selective and hats off to the deal team to our development group.","And I think it's just that we're in a good place in time where maybe generationally people need self updates. I don't think there's any one driver we've seen that's tax related or anything like that. We're going to continue to -- to consolidate the business. That's how we've built Republic. We'll continue to be in the hunt for good deals.","Noah Kaye","Yes. That makes sense. If I could just sneak one related on, the potential obviously for divestitures out of the WMA -- the WMA merger, I mean who knows how large that is, but if you could just talk about what you see as maybe the opportunity there. It will obviously be a new source of targets and kind of how you see the overlap or potential fit with your footprint.","Don Slager","Well sure. I'll leave it to the team of the big green company to determine what they think they're going to have to put up for sale based on the divestiture or markets don't fit or whatever issued by the DOJ. We will be glad to be looking at opportunity there if there is any. We'll be looking at opportunity that could fit into our markets. Again, you've read all the deal points. So again, we will look for good opportunity to buy good companies, good cash flow at the right multiple and at the right return. So -- our general stance in this business is we look at everything and then we -- we're very intentional about what we go forward on.","Noah Kaye","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question will be from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari","Hi. Good afternoon. My first question is just on MSW landfill pricing. Maybe if you could comment whether you think there's more opportunity there. It seems like the 3% number on pretty strong volume is much higher than you've seen in the last couple of quarters. I think your largest competitor had a similar MSW landfill number on pricing. Is this the beginning of investors beginning to -- see landfill pricing, beginning to see more momentum than we've seen historically?","Don Slager","Well let me start. I'll let Jon give you some color. You have heard me say many times that -- these landfills are very expensive to own. They're very difficult to develop. You own them in the perpetuity. Every single time -- we bury someone's ton of waste, we're taking the risk, if you will and owning it and selling that real estate forever. These assets are nearly impossible to replicate and I have been very vocal about the fact that they frankly have not held up their end of pricing in the marketplace over the past several years.","We're certainly evaluating the costs of running landfill. We have some higher costs related to leachate that we have to pass-through to customers. I think part of that is what you're seeing. And I think I'd like to believe what you said Hamzah that this is the beginning of land to landfill and the infrastructure -- finally getting some traction on price that it deserves and frankly needs to offset some of the future of costs related to owning people's waste forever and ever. Jon, what do you think?","Jon Vander Ark","Yes. I think, we've been exhibiting a lot of price leadership on this for a long time. And I can tell you we're looking at every ton that comes into every one of our landfills and understanding what is the true cost of that and ensuring that we are getting a fair return to Don's point for taking up that real estate forever and you'll continue to see I think a positive trend in that direction.","Hamzah Mazari","Good. Got it. And then just on your adjusted volume number of 60 bps. It seems like that there's a massive disparity with your largest competitor that reported 3% adjusted. I mean if you go back historically the volume differential on an apples-to-apples clean number adjusting for comps is pretty big. They talked about technology investments and customer emphasis driving that. I'm just curious is it just asset footprint? Are you just earlier in your technology spend? Or are you just sort of walking away from more business? Just any thoughts as to -- what are your thoughts on the volume side? Can you drive more volume? Or is this just sort of your focus is elsewhere or maybe the technology spend, maybe gets better and drives more volume?","Chuck Serianni ","Yes. So a couple of things I'd point to you Hamzah. The first thing is that the 60 basis points is muted by the fact that we had one less work day. So if you include that in the mix and the volume growth is usually 1.1%. So more consistent -- with our historic average.","The other thing I would point to you, if you look at the temporary large container business, the volumes there were muted also but that's because we took this as an opportunity to further price those volumes. We felt like there was more pricing available in that line of business. And obviously, we were able to achieve that with price of 4.2%. So we always see this price\/volume as a balance and we've always had a very balanced approach to price\/volume as you're well aware of. And we'll continue to maintain that balanced approach going into the future.","Don Slager","Yes, Hamzah look, we're digging deep into the recycling book of business. We are raising prices effectively. We're also going to be walking away from some business here and there. This task can be kind of lumpy when you lose a large RISI contract or something that is meeting returns. ","Winning and losing a national account can have a big impact. As Chuck said we always try to find this right balance with price and volume and where is the price elasticity. We would tell you, we think we're getting generally speaking our fair share of growth and it will kind of ebb and flow a little bit with mix, but I would read more into that if I were you.","Hamzah Mazari","Yes, got you. Just last question. I'll turn it over. I'm just trying to understand sort of Republic's strategy on large acquisitions. Progressive Waste Republic didn't participate. ADSW Republic didn't participate. Is it just sort of DOJ issues? Is it valuation? Is it that the board just wants 100% return of cash and no leverage? Just any sort of big picture thoughts on how we should view that?","Don Slager","Okay, let me start with this and you heard me say it probably many times, but in almost every situation there's a natural buyer, right? So when you have a willing seller, there tends to be a natural buyer. There\u2019s certain things that fit better with other companies. It might be somebody has a leg up in more landfill internalization. It might be complementary, other infrastructure or the need to pay a little bit more for a permit that you couldn't get on your own or landfill space you couldn't achieve or develop. All those things kind of weigh into our situation.","I would tell you, I think we're getting the deals we want. You brought up Progressive. I mean, there was a clear-case financial buyer there because of the inversion that was able to take place. We would not have been able to do an inversion in that situation because of our size.","And so if we were to got down to an absolute auction and that deal going to the highest bidder, I think frankly the same company that bought, it would have bought it because of the advantage and the inversion. So those are just real facts.","We look at everything I said a minute ago, so you can take that comment and then imagine that we also look at ADS and some really good assets, good leadership team, some really interesting things there. It may just come down to in the end a better fit for the current company that is engaged in bringing that deal together.","So I don't have anything bad to say about the assets of the business. I would focus back to the fact that we are going to put $300 million to work this year where we've got a full pipeline and we are looking at deals and we're going to continue to drive value for shareholders through a balanced approach of cash allocation. And that's a combination of buying good cash flow at the right multiple, i.e. acquisitions, developing current assets, expanding landfills, developing -- spending CapEx on our current fleet and technology as well as the obvious buying back our stock at the right price and dividend. And our dividend CAGR has been a very consistent 8% over the last several years.","So we factor all that in and that's what I can tell you. I think we've got great opportunity ahead of us to continue to consolidate our fair share of this business and you'll see us do that. And into another question, there's an opportunity to pick up some pieces that don't fit or are mandated divestitures in this process will -- we certainly think will be at the table there as well.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire","Hi, good afternoon.","Don Slager","Hi, Brian.","Brian Maguire","I just wanted to make sure I understood some of the components in the reiterated guidance as it relates to recycling and a couple of other things. It sounds like the impact from lower recycled prices is going to be about a $0.07 headwind and you incurred $0.01 in the first quarter and you've got $0.06 still out in front of you. And if that's the case, just trying to understand what the offsets are to keep the guidance unchanged. I think it sounds like the upside M&A is a partial contributor to that. But then will the balance of that just be a more favorable outlook in the core business essentially?","Don Slager","Well, it's not really M&A because frankly the cost of integration sort of tends to outweigh the benefit of integration in the first six to eight months. So, the upside of M&A really isn't going to make us get a lot of benefit this year. It really drives a ton of benefit next year when we get the rollover from that. It really is more the underlying strength of the business.","Its cost as Jon said. Jon leads the operating core of the business. He and his team has done a great job on labor costs, on maintenance, on labor efficiency productivity. He said turnovers kicked down a couple of points here. That speaks to an opportunity that will continue through the year.","Pricing strength, all the work that Jon mentioned in and around recycling itself right? So, the headwind is coming from recycling but we got busy. I would tell you that Republic was sort of the tip of the spear in the marketplace when it came to attacking the recycling issue, so we've got rollover benefits from what we did last year.","And Jon and the team and the sales organization have gone -- have turned right run right into the fight this year on. So, Jon you want to talk about a couple of things you're doing this year that are going to offset?","Jon Vander Ark","Yes. So, on recycling we had $12 million of pricing actions our annualized pricing actions in the first quarter built off the back of $55 million last year and we're not stopping. We are literally going through all 1,100 of our municipal recycling contracts and we are asking for a fair model right? That one that has -- shares the risk and the volatility and that we get paid a fair return for what we do.","And some customers say no at first and that's not stopping us. We're continuing to have that dialogue. And just like what we've done over time in the alternative index, we will make progress over time as we continue to represent the case because the facts are on our side. All we're asking is for a fair model and to be an environmental partner with us over time.","Brian Maguire","Okay, that's clear. It makes sense. Just wanted to come back to the question on sort of volume and the different moving pieces in there. So, they're down 15. It sounds like 50 bps of that is just the calendar, so it's probably down one as a better representation there. I'm just wondering if you could break out the components to that as far as the special waste comp the intentional shedding of business and any weather-related impact that you maybe saw in there.","Don Slager","Yes, let me start with this and Chuck you can spread the numbers out. The business the solid waste business grows with population growth that drives housing formation that drives business formation. That is still the reality of where solid waste generation comes from. So, good ongoing economics job growth, wage growth all the rest they are good for volume growth.","But the general reality is that volume is going to grow 1% to 2%. You might have a few periods of time where you can push it to 2.5% or 3%, but I will tell you that if you're thinking a 3% volume growth is sustainable, you're probably giving up price, right? And so you're probably growing your business with some big chunks of volume that may not be able to sustain price long term and that's our view.","And so we don't spend a lot of time chasing trophy accounts that have low margin. We don't -- while we have a nice little national accounts portfolio they are sort of a mid-sized national accounts and not these mega accounts that frankly never give you pricing leverage or opportunity to expanding your margins that's why.","So, we're going to generally live kind of in that 1% to 2% volume growth ebbing and flowing with the economy. And when Chuck gets -- nets it all out there for you in a minute you're going to see that we're kind of right in that 1% to 2% volume growth which is kind of the sweet spot and getting pricing and getting customers who will accept pricing in the future because the fact is nobody in this business can offset inflation through efficiencies alone. I mean people are better according their businesses in that.","So, again that's the real scoop. That's frankly what you should be putting in your model. Chuck?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, so, we talked about total volume decline of 1.5%. Like we said the 0.5 point -- 50 basis point of that is the work day. But then you've got 210 basis points associated with special waste and non-regrettable losses. So you net all that out, then you can see that we did have good growth in line with our historical average on the volume side.","Brian Maguire","And so, does it sounds like much impact from weather that you guys saw?","Chuck Serianni","No. It was -- the impact from weather was pretty minor. Maybe it was 10 basis points, but it looks pretty minor.","Brian Maguire","Okay. And last one, just kind of related. Will the one fewer work day sort of reverse out in the third quarter, or some time later in the year?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, it reverses in the third quarter.","Brian Maguire","Okay. That\u2019s what I thought. Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question will be from Sean Eastman of Keybanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sean Eastman","Hi, team. The first question is just on recycling. It's great to see such great things happening in the core business and helping to offset some of those headwinds there. But just in light of all these price actions and continuing those dialogues through the year, is there -- relative to what's in the annual filing from 2018, is there an updated sensitivity we should be thinking about as it relates to potential further moves in that recycling commodity price basket?","Chuck Serianni","No. We're still at $0.04 of EPS impact for $10 decline in our basket of commodities and that's an annualized number. But as we continue to make progress on all the various initiatives associated with recycling, our expectation is that sensitivity will go down.","Sean Eastman","Okay. That makes sense. And then, it's great to see the leverage on the maintenance and labor lines. I just wondered, how much more juice we have there on that leverage and that One Fleet program and some of the labor programs? What inning are we in terms of driving those efficiencies and still seeing that into the future?","Don Slager","Well, again, I'll start and I'll let Jon give you a little bit of color. Look, we're -- as he said in his remarks, we're seeing the benefits of the One Fleet initiative. We are kind of past One Fleet 1.0 and we're moving into the sort of next phase of really using all the data we have and understanding what the real life cycle of the fleet. Jon's got some great ideas.","Look, what I always tell you guys is, there's way more going on here than we talk about, right because there's a lot of good technology we're working on, there's a lot of sort of phase two and three things up our sleeves. We tend not to talk to you about them until we're ready to put them in a model, ready to put them in the guide. But Jon, can you give a little bit of color?","Jon Vander Ark","Yes. On maintenance costs, we're fighting underlying inflation of parts cost on an increasingly sophisticated vehicles, so we're doing a great job of maintaining that on the maintenance side. On the labor cost side, we're going through routing efficiencies, using technology and certainly it's technology customer of our vehicles, but lots of initiatives lots of effort underway there to understand it.","We want to service, but first of all we want to be safe. We want to service the customer and pick them up every time, but then we want to do that efficiently. And lots of efforts underway to figure out how we do that, and showing some real progress in fleet market.","Sean Eastman","Okay. Thanks. Then the last one for me. This could be totally not material, but I just keep seeing headlines on this Rainbow business you guys own. Something about some potential turnover in that one of their big contracts and then also some class-action suit around that purchase. So just wondering is there anything there or just noise?","Don Slager","Well, here's the thing, right? One of the great things about owning a portfolio, right, is that it ebbs and flows, right? And so one economy, one market may be booming or another may be dragging. Weather might be 50 degrees below in Chicago, but the sun is shining in Florida.","It's the same as it relates to the sort of the lumpiness of business. We have several hundred million dollars a year of municipal contracts that come to term and we have to renegotiate. In the midst of all that, there are certain political issues and so on and so on and so forth.","We've built this business through acquisitions. And when you buy companies, you have to sort of work out sort of some legacy issues and part of that is we're going through. What we don't do is, we don't, on this call or in any time, speaks specifically to any one contract or any one issue, because we've got this portfolio.","I would tell you this, these kind of things really are no different than the kind of things we dealt with last year or the year before that or 20 years ago, right? It's just part of what we do for a living. And so we do win some we do lose along the way, but overall the strength of the portfolio and the mix carries today. So we're working around the clock with a lot of customers right now to find new solutions overcome recycling issues and deal with some of the legacy stuff that just sometimes we inherit along the way. So that's all I'm giving you on that one.","Sean Eastman","I appreciate it. Understood. Thanks very much for the time.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Feniger of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Feniger","Yeah. Thanks guys for taking my question. I may have missed this. Why is \u2013 I know it's just one quarter but why is cash from ops down year-over-year?","Chuck Serianni","Yeah. It's really just a timing issue, Michael. We \u2013 it's the timing of maybe the timing of working capital and including the timing of CapEx. Once again for the entire year we're right on our guidance in terms of our free cash flow.","Michael Feniger","Sounds good. And Chuck is there any reason why margins should not sequentially step up in Q2 and Q3?","Chuck Serianni","Yes. We're expecting that margins to continue to increase obviously over the course of the rest of the year. And that's right in line with our guidance of up 30 to 50 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion.","Michael Feniger","Got it. And then \u2013 did you \u2013 or was there any change in trend in April? Did you actually see underlying volumes potentially maybe pick up as we started Q2? And on the opportunity you mentioned on the temp business where you're pushing price, did you still see that momentum where you reported a really strong open price number. I mean, is there any reason why that number should decelerate from here?","Don Slager","Well, I'll take the first half and then I'll let Jon talk about what's going on in temp volume. What was the first part of the question?","Nicole Giandinoto","What we've seen in April.","Don Slager","Oh, April volume. Yeah, so we're not really talking about April right? We're talking about Q1. Look, when we reaffirmed guidance, right? We are reaffirming guidance based on all the underlying great work that the team's done in the quarter. Certainly, we're taking it into consideration what we're seeing in April, but we don't generally give commentary on it other than we want to give you a little bit of color in and around what we've closed to date on the M&A front. But the real time for us when we're talking about seasonality is May. We've got to kind of get May in the books for us to really just kind of compare year-over-year seasonality. But by the very fact that we are reaffirming guidance with such confidence, I think would tell you that we feel really good about what we're seeing in the business on this very day.","Jon Vander Ark","Yeah. I would just say from the underlying demand, we see strong demand in large \u2013 across most of our markets. And we have the tools to look at the price\/volume trade-off and try to make those on a daily basis, and again as we see demand come in and we make those trade-offs. And really we're looking at maximizing return on our assets. We're not looking to buy more assets to take low-margin work.","Michael Feniger","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael Hoffman","Hey, gang. Thanks for taking the questions. Nice Q.","Don Slager","Thanks, Michael.","Chuck Serianni","Thanks, Michael.","Michael Hoffman","The $142 million spend what did you get for it in revenues?","Chuck Serianni","So in total that's about $55 million in annualized revenue Michael.","Michael Hoffman","And how do I think about the margin of that?","Chuck Serianni","It's kind of \u2013 I would say that it's probably just a little bit higher than the company average.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. That helps.","Nicole Giandinoto","But again, Michael just to put a comment on that. As Jon mentioned, sometimes there's a little bit of implementation and integration costs upfront, so we'll grow into that margin that Chuck mentioned, but it's not right out of the gate accretive overall to the company margin.","Michael Hoffman","Yeah. No, I got it. It just helps to do the modeling. And then back on this whole volume question everybody wants to focus on. I mean I would think all day long, you would take lots of price and very little volume, because you get so much more leverage. But more importantly, if I look at the data you did give us, and if I remember correctly your landfill business is predominantly -- the third party volume is predominantly municipal contracts. So to get a 0.3% price and 6.5% volume from that one the pricing is pretty powerful because it's indexed business, so you've driven a lot of leverage there. But volume is huge telling you the underlying kind of economy is just in great shape. Am I correct?","Don Slager","Yeah. On top of that, and somebody else on the call brought up, is landfill pricing is starting to get traction, because it's been a little bit flattish more than maybe you would expect with the consolidation. So I think that's really the good news. But you're right we don't have a lot of third party volume that makes up a big percentage.","Jon Vander Ark","Yeah. I'd also say Mike you're seeing the fruits of our efforts around purchasing CPI come up. So its contracts and the fruit of our alternative index work. We didn't just work on municipal collection contracts. We certainly worked on MSW contracts as well.","Michael Hoffman","Right. So..,","Don Slager","On your earlier point, right? I mean every time we dig our profitability by customer, by call, by route, by point of business, right? And you're right I mean that each one of these things has to carry its own weight. And we're going to continue to work through the business the way we've always had. Just talking about landfill, I mean we're slicing and dicing every stream. Jon mentioned it earlier, at the landfill and making sure that everything carries the appropriate return.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. That helps. And then Chuck, when you gave -- earlier you said CNG is a negative 60 and special waste is negative 50. That wasn't at the EBITDA line. But does that just -- if I step that up to gross OpEx, that's just a straight carry through because those are all operating related?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, they are Michael. That's right.","Michael Hoffman","So when I look at 61 versus 60.5, that's the waterfall I'm building? Okay.","Chuck Serianni","Yeah, that's right.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. And then directionally on gross margin, I know you don't give this, but can you talk about the trend of the three sort of major lines of business solid waste, recycling E&P year-over-year? Directionally, what was happening in the trend in the gross margin?","Chuck Serianni","Yeah. The gross margins are all trending positive, Michael. And you would think that that would be the case right? We're once again working back into the guidance that we gave for EBITDA margin expansion, 30 to 50 basis points for the year.","Michael Hoffman","So on all three businesses, its positive even recycling? I have a thought recycling might have been flat.","Chuck Serianni","Yeah, but it went slightly positive. But keep in mind, all of the initiatives that we've put into place, once again back in the 2018 and here again in 2019. So we are starting to see the benefits associated with those initiatives. And that's once again why we were able to offset the recycling and processing headwind here in Q1.","Don Slager","If you think about that in context of what we've accomplished so far in the getting this headwind from recycling if you will, and think about how the benefits of that will roll into next year. Let's just say let's just hope for a minute that commodity prices stay where they are and don't get worse. Let's hope for a minute that these other mills come online in the U.S. and that has a positive impact.","Let's hope for a minute that our long-term view of recycling holds up, right? That population growth and emerging economies and middle-class and all blah, blah, blah is all going to be right. And we've already offset sort of the current headwind. If we combine all the efforts that the team has put into place, it really sets us up pretty well for next year as well right, as these things anniversary and we just build on the momentum and as we shift the model. And again the operating leaders Jon, and the sales organization is doing a great job, and customers one by one by one are coming to the realization of what has happened here. Wouldn't you say, Jon?","Jon Vander Ark","Absolutely.","Michael Hoffman","Right. So let me follow on with that. If you took the current run rate of revenues on an $85 commodity book, what should the profitability of that be in an absolute dollar opportunity?","Don Slager","How about this? How about we stick with Q1? And how about we stick with our guidance for 2019, Michael? We're going to meet our guidance. We're going to meet our cash flow guidance, and we're going to be, if not one of the leaders, the leader in turning this recycling business around and making it sustainable for customers, we being a great environmental partner. And as we get more and more traction through the year, we'll be talking in October about how it sets us up for 2020, but it will be a good story.","Michael Hoffman","Well, okay, fair enough. It was much of a higher-level question of, it's a big number when you fix this, some it might take two or three years, but it's a big number.","Don Slager","It's a big number. It will be fixed. The underlying issue is customers want to do this. We'll just have to help them do it right.","Michael Hoffman","Right.","Don Slager","And it's going to be good story -- and it will be a good growth story for Republic Services.","Michael Hoffman","Right. Last question Chuck. Your cash flow from operations was 22% of revenues, which is terrific in the context of the expectation for the year. So maybe the dollars are down, but the percent of revenue is a very good number.","Chuck Serianni","Yes, that's right, Michael.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. Yeah, all right. Okay. ","Nicole Giandinoto","And Michael just to add a point for your model. So if you look at the CapEx spend in Q1 relative to our capital guide, it was less than 20% for our full year guide. So Q1 is a really strong cash flow quarter for us and that might trickle down a little bit for the remainder of the year and as this kind of timing goes through the year.","Michael Hoffman","Got it. Thanks very much.","Don Slager","Thanks Michael.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Henry Chien","Hi, guys. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Thanks for squeezing me in. I have a follow-up question on your M&A plans and just the additional capital. I'm just curious if the type of deals that you're looking at if it's still in terms of the tuck-insurance, if it's still for the solid waste business or you're considering anything adjacent to that.","Don Slager","Okay. Well, look the majority of our spend is always solid waste. The majority is frankly leans toward collection by definition tuck-in. There aren't -- frankly, we're pretty well situated with infrastructure throughout the company or countries so we're not spending a lot of dollars just to work in these last several years on infrastructure. But when we do obviously that brings -- the prices they go up just a little bit.","But tuck-ins by their very nature are in our core space and in our current geographies. We have had a little good fortune in some good opportunities that are in adjacent geographies, but in the solid waste core space so that is another place that we do grow and intend to grow. But that's where we're spending most of our time.","We've got some good opportunities in and around the E&P space. We'll continue to look at those. That's a good business for us, high-margin business for us. But again for a long, long time, we'll be making most of what we make here out of running a solid waste business very well and that's where most of this is coming from today.","Henry Chien","Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.","Don Slager","Thank you so much Denise. In closing, we are extremely pleased with our first quarter performance. Solid waste fundamentals remain strong in the current economic backdrop is supportive of continued growth. Given our team's relentless focus on operational execution and the passion they have for our customers, we are reaffirming our full year financial guidance.","Finally, I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to the men and women of Republic Services. As a result of their collective efforts, we remain to the world's Most Ethical Companies list by Ethisphere for the third year in a row, as well as Barron's 100 Most Sustainable U.S. Companies list for the second consecutive year.

Republic Services is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, RSG. Today's call is being recorded. And all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a question and answer session following Republic summary of quarterly earnings. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. DelGhiaccio. Good afternoon, Mr. DelGhiaccio.","Brian DelGhiaccio","Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. This is Brian DelGhiaccio, and I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services' first quarter 2015 conference call. Don Slager, our CEO, and Chuck Serianni, our CFO, are joining me as we discuss our performance.","Before we get started, I would like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information we discuss on today's call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may be materially different from actual results. Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.","The material that we discuss today is time-sensitive. If, in the future, you listen to a rebroadcast or recording of this conference call, you should be sensitive to the date of the original call, which is April 23, 2015. Please note that this call is the property of Republic Services, Inc.

I want to point out that our SEC filings; our earnings press release, which includes GAAP reconciliation tables; and a discussion of business activities, along with the recording of this call are available on Republic's Web site at republicservices.com.","And finally, I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website, along with instructions for listening to the live webcast of the event.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.","Don Slager","Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our strong first quarter results which were in line with our expectations. The Republic team continue to execute on our long-term strategy which is designed to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, expand margins and continually improve return on invested capital.","Some of our financial highlights for the quarter include, first quarter EPS was $0.49 which included a $0.02 benefit from the timing of our Fuel Recovery Fee. We anticipated this benefit as part of our full year guidance provided in February. Adjusted free cash flow was $241 million which was in line with our expectations. EBITDA margin was 28.9% and represents a 120 basis points improvement from the prior year. Approximately 90 basis points of the improvement relates to the net impact of fuel and recycle commodities. Core price in the first quarter was 3.7% and average yield was 2.1%. This is our highest level of average yield in over four years.","First quarter volumes increased 1.9% with positive contribution from all of our collection and disposal lines of business. We returned $194 million total cash to our shareholders during the quarter. This includes 2.3 million shares repurchased for $95 million. We have $265 million remaining on our existing share repurchased authorization which we intent to complete during 2015. We continue to make progress on our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, improve productivity and reduce costs.","By the end of the first quarter 15% of our fleet was operating on natural gas. 69% of our residential fleet was automated and 64% of our fleet was certified under our One Fleet maintenance program. Additionally all of our markets are now using our capture pricing tool. We have trained and implemented our priority based selling program or PBS in approximately 60% of our markets. We expect PBS to be fully implemented by the end of the year.","And finally over 700,000 customers are enrolled in our customer portal called My Resource. On February 13 we closed the acquisition of Tervita LLC. The assets provide a platform to expand our presence in the U.S. E&P waste sector and united experience high quality work force with the Republic team. We are still early in the integration process but it's going well and is expected.","In summary, our strong performance in the first quarter was in line with our expectations and keep us on track to achieve the full year guidance we provided in February. Consistent with prior practice we will update our full year guidance on our Q2 earnings call in July. ","Before turning the call over to Chuck, I want to provide an update on our municipal business. We continue to educate municipalities and expand the use of indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, then work closely aligned with our cost structure. These include the water and sewer and trash collection services index, and the garbage and trash collection index. During the quarter we converted an additional $40 million of annual revenue and now we have over 300 contracts representing $110 million of annual revenue using an alternative index. ","We are still early in the process but very encouraged by our initial success. We continue to offer high quality services and products to our municipal customers. But must earn an appropriate return to deliver those services. Converting to alternative indices, together with our actions we are taking to improve the performance of our municipal business, it will take several years to realize the full impact given the long term nature of these contracts. ","Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?","Chuck Serianni","Thanks Don. First quarter 2015 revenue was approximately 2.2 billion, an increase of 92 million over the prior year. This 4.4% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.3% and acquisitions of 2.1%. The components of internal growth are average yield growth of 2.1%. Average yields in the collection business was 2.5%, which includes 4.1% yield in the industrial business, 3.2% yield in the commercial business and 70 basis points in the residential business. Average yield in the post collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 2%.","Core price, which measures price increases, net rollbacks to our same store customer base was 3.7%. Core price consisted of 4.8% in the open market and 1.8% in the restricted portion of our business. Our volumes increased 1.9% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.7%, primarily due to an increase in large container industrial volume.","Growth in the industrial business was 3.9% with relatively equal contribution from the ferment business and temporary C&D holes. Volume in the small container commercial business was up 0.8%, and residential volume was positive 1.1%. The post-collection business was up 3.9% which is comprised of landfill growth of 4.2%, and transfer volume growth of 3.3%. Within landfill, MSW was up 5%, C&D increased 10% and special waste grew 3%. Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 70 basis points. ","The change relates to the decline in the cost of fuel which decreased approximately [$15 million] dollars compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.92 in the first quarter, from $3.96 in the prior year, a decrease of 26%. The current average diesel price is $2.78 per gallon. Currently we recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in operating income.","We realized a $0.02 EPS benefit in the first quarter due to a timing difference between our fuel recovery fee revenue adjustment in fuel expense, which tends to lag by one to two months. We do not expect this benefit to continue in future quarters. Finally, commodity revenues decreased to 100 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 17% to an average price of $97 per ton in the first quarter, from a $117 per ton in the prior year.","Current average commodity prices are approximately $96 per ton, First quarter recycling volume of 580,000 tons represents growth of approximately 4% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions volume were down 5% and below our expectations. This was primarily due to congestion at the West Coast ports. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $3 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue.","Now I will discuss changes in margins. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.9% compared to 27.7% in the prior year, an increase of 120 basis points. Most of the improvement relates to changes in net fuel and commodity which added 90 basis points. The remaining 30 basis points change primarily relates to reduction in risk insurance expense as a result a favorable claims development in continued improvement in safety related performance.","SG&A costs were 11% of revenue, an increase of 70 basis points compared to the prior year. This change includes acquisition related cost and integration expenses associated with recent acquisitions which included approximately 30 basis points of expense during quarter. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of our cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Brain will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow, and selected balance sheet data.","Brian DelGhiaccio","Thanks Chuck. First quarter 2015 interest expense was $89 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 39.4% which was consistent with our full year guidance. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was 241 milli and in line with our expectations. Cash flow can vary quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of working capital. At March 31st our accounts receivable balance was $930 million and day sales outstanding net of acquisitions was 38 days or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately 7.6 billion at March 31st and availability under our bank facility was approximately 1.7 billion.","I will now turn the call back to Don.","Don Slager","Thank you, Brian. To conclude our first quarter results, put us right where we thought we would be, I am proud of how the Republic team continued to execute our strategy and our strong performance reflects their hard work. We will continue to deliver on our promises to our key stakeholders including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. At this time operator, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question today. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for the first question. The first question comes from Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Ovshey ","Couple of one's for you on the pricing side, so the 2.1% yield is a nice improvement relative to last year. Can you talk about how you see the trajectory for the balance of the year because I believe in the second half their maybe some negative impact of the reset of CPI. Do you think we can stay above this 2% level for the balance of the year?","Brian DelGhiaccio","No Alex, we\u2019re sticking with our guidance as we said in our prepared remarks, we think that average yield should still be somewhere around the one year guidance we gave. There is couple of things happening in Q1, first of all we\u2019ve got a little softer quarter last year to compare to, so that kind of flows through our results here, you got to keep that in mind, Q1 of last year was impacted negatively by weather and other things. We also have had increasingly better pricing on a consecutive basis over the last four or five quarters and so as we get through the year the comps, the pricing are going to get a little more difficult because we have been improving average yield consistently. So that\u2019s going to be coming up on us. And then lastly we got a lot of pricing actions out there in Q1, specifically in and around recycling. As you know we were hit pretty hard with commodity sale prices and we\u2019ve taken some pretty serious actions for pricing in the field specifically in and around recycling customers and that\u2019s all showing up in that yield.","Alex Ovshey ","And then just on Tervita, now that we\u2019re into '15, can you provide an update on what you expect the revenue contribution could be from Tervita in '15?","Don Slager","Yes, so we think it is just going to be right where we thought it would be for the most parts, had a little tour itself for us, but again we've only owned it for six weeks, we\u2019re really happy with the assets. We have seen, I know everyone sort of read about all of the rig count dropping faster than we expected. We\u2019re seeing a little bit of softness, we anticipated some of that softness in our pro forma, in our budget and our guidance and the place we're probably being seen the weakest part in net business is the solids control piece of the business, as coming a little softer than expected and that\u2019s really got much more of a lower margin associated with it. So I think the real performance of that business as going to be pretty much on track what we expected. As far as call it cash flow on EPS.","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Redding with BB&T. Your line is open.","Charles Redding ","Just wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit more on the commercial side, in terms of trends what you're seeing container waste is going to be like?","Don Slager","Yes, so the container waste are up a little bit, service increases are up but not dramatically. I would tell you what we\u2019re seeing in the business is continuing a broad recovery. Again, we saw it first in the construction demolition and we've talked about that for a year. We\u2019re starting to see a little bit of that improve in and around the commercial business and we\u2019re seeing it frankly in some of our MSW at the landfill as well. So a broader recovery pretty good solid recovery across all regions, but not a spike just kind of a steady improvement.","Charles Redding ","Do you get any sense of slowing or pressure come on the industrial side, if we think about domestically speaking the pull back in industrial production. Are you seeing any of that right at this point?","Don Slager","As Chuck said, we\u2019ve got really solid performance both on the permanent side of our industrial business as well as on the temporary side, pretty strong performance. Now remember that\u2019s we\u2019re going to have some headwind as we go forward on a year-over-year basis because again we\u2019ve been improving that segment of our business pretty consistently quarter-by-quarter. So it's going to be more difficult as we go through the recovery to maintain some of these high growth numbers because of the comps. I mean we would expect to continue to grow but just maybe not at the same rate. ","Charles Redding ","That's great, appreciate the color.","Operator","The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James, your line is open.","Tyler Brown","Hey Don, so just, would love to get some color on Capture and PBS, so you know looks like you guys are virtually rolled out on Capture maybe PBS has got a little bit more to go, but it seems like you're getting some traction there, but any data points you could share around the impacts there and maybe through low churn or maybe that spread differential between lost and new business? ","Don Slager","So, I won't give you the exact numbers Tyler, but I can tell you that where we've rolled out Capture and where they've been at it the longest, the price per unit of new sales are compared to last year are improving, the Capture also comes in handy and the PBS training comes in handy with retaining business, so reducing net churn from a lost business and better negotiating skills with customers on potential reduction of rates when that's necessary, that's improving. So we're seeing impact maturing which we expected, we're seeing higher rates on new business as expected and we don't have, we've got it rolled out everywhere as you'd imagine that the divisions that had it rolled out earliest have got better compliance and adoption rates and it's the ones that have been through more recently, still need to work on that, but we're continuing to improve that and by the end of the year we'll be very solid across the entire company both with Capture, PBS will be rolled out and of course we have enhanced our CRM tool, so those three things together make the sales organization much more effective, much more efficient, much more professional. And we\u2019ve got the controls in place that we need to further improve churn and new pricing and new sales as well.","Tyler Brown","Okay, perfect, that's a good color. So you know again, nice quarter here and it seems like again the pricing side maybe has got a little bit of momentum there but it still seems that maintenance and repair really hasn't seen a lot of leverage from One Suite, maybe I'm missing it and that's very possible here but when would you expect kind of that unit cost inflation on the maintenance and repair side to maybe moderate or maybe even turn negative?","Don Slager","I'm going to let Chuck give you the numbers in a minute but let me just give you the color again. You know at the divisions that have been [indiscernible] longest, we've seen reduction in some pretty important metrics. Lower engine cost per hour, we've seen better fleet reliability, measured is less downtime. We've seen lower tech turnover, pretty hard to find diesel techs these days so the maintenance shops that have one fleet installed are better placed to work for those techs, all will be positive metrics. So we know it\u2019s working and I'll let Chuck talk a little bit about how some of the margins, the mix have impacted what you're looking at.","Chuck Serianni ","So Tyler, you know it's important to note that the impact that net fuel and commodity and commodity has had on the margins overall. We said that it was a 90 basis point improvement in the EBITDA margin, but it has a similar impact in terms of the cost margins, the impact on labor is about 30 basis points. When you look at the impact of that revenue going away, and the impact on maintenance is probably about 10 basis points. The other thing I would note is that it also has had a negative impact on our SG&A as a percentage of revenue to the tune of about 20 basis points, so you're seeing that included in the numbers that you're looking at in our press release.","Tyler Brown","Okay, yes, that's great. And then Don if I can squeeze kind of a left field question here, but I am very curious about this, so there's been a lot of talk in some of the transportation rags about a Federal highway bill that may add a size and weight provision, which would allow for heavier trucks and I'm just curious if you guys have ever looked at this or maybe contemplated any potential savings from any big changes on size and weights? I guess maybe thought of another way, do you guys typically cube out or weighed out your transfer trailers.","Don Slager","Yes, we generally weight out the transfer trailers, these are 52 foot trailers now, really mega capacity, so we work within the compliance of the current regulations for gross vehicle weight, generally speaking we max out the weight before we max out the space in the trailer and the same thing in our hauling fleet, our collection fleet. They can generally handle more weight than which is allowed under the regulation, so we live within the regulations today, we haven't looked a lot at what refining those would do for us. I don\u2019t know where that bill at or how much traction it's got but we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time on that Tyler.","Tyler Brown","As left field, I was just curious, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets, your line is open.","Joe Box","A question for you on your residential business, if I just use the 552 million that you give in the release in terms of revenue, you're looking at about 2.6% growth rate in that business and if my model is right that looks like it's the highest growth since the last cycle. Can you maybe just put some parameters around that growth, are you seeing any changes within the organic growth rates there or is it some of the small tuck-ins just starting to add up.","Chuck Serianni ","One thing Joe to remember too as well is that that's going to include acquisition growth as well, so when you think about things like you know the Rainbow franchise and some of those things that we acquired, so it's not just organic growth, it's also going to include acquisition growth as well.","Joe Box","Yes and that\u2019s why I was asking if you could just flush out maybe the difference between organic and inorganic, I mean have you seen any sort of change in the growth rate for just the organic component?","Don Slager","I would say as far as unit growth within current contracts, we haven\u2019t seen any real surge there, that business tends to be a little lumpy because these are generally in the residential business five-year contracts they have [indiscernible]. We do have a couple of new contracts from organic growth in the mix today. But we budget every year for a little bit of new business and some loss business in that contractual base.","Joe Box","So it sounds like probably no inflection point from new home formation or anything like that though?","Don Slager","Not in the ordinary.","Joe Box","Relative to the SG&A, I think Chuck you call that earlier that there was some integration expense that was included in the SG&A. I'm curious what a decent run rate for the salary side is, should we expect about 30 basis points of headwind over the next couple of quarters, I know you\u2019ve got some additional integration with Tervita is that a decent run rate?","Chuck Serianni","We\u2019ve said -- we\u2019ve got some continued headwind with Tervita with acquisition type cost. I think overall for the year we expect that SG&A as a percent of revenue is going to be a little bit of in excess of 10%, but I would tell you that longer term for the company we feel that 10% of revenue is a comfortable spot for us in terms with our SG&A.","Don Slager","Yes and the other thing to remember Joe is that the impact of lower fuel recovery fee and lower commodity prices that doesn\u2019t have a cost offset in SG&A. So as a percent of revenue that gives us about 20% increase as a result of the decline in those revenues.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open.","Michael Hoffman","I am trying to get my hands, I count that your recent guidance in the middle of the year, but you got off to a pretty good start. There is a couple of numbers that I'm like okay, this is to do weird things in the second half of the year if I am holding one and a half price, it feels like it\u2019s got to walk itself up to some. And then you had a 2% to 2.5% revenue growth rate, but that was before Tervita, so I got to assume that number has got to change anyway, right? I'm struggling with -- you're not changing your outlook not even sort of being a little more optimistic about we feel really good about the outlook.","Don Slager","Yes, so let's say this, we feel good about what\u2019s going on in the business I think our comments reflected that. We got some good things going on, our initiatives all have traction, we completed the rollout of capture, we\u2019re on track with their other major initiatives, we talked about some of the broader base recovery, we\u2019re seeing in MSW the landfill, commercial business starting to tick up a little bit, all that\u2019s good. Tervita is going along fine, little headwind there. Again we\u2019ve -- this was pretty much what we expected when we gave you guidance only two months ago.","There are some anomalies and remember that we -- even though we had to take pretty big hit year-over-year in our guidance from standpoint of recyclables, we\u2019ve actually -- they are actually weaker than we planned and you see that there in the numbers. So we\u2019ve got that as the headwind remaining on the year and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen there just yet. So we still have to overcome three more quarters of a pretty tough recycling commodity market. We are getting traction in the programs. Remember last Q1 was pretty weak with the adverse weather, so this quarter is a fairly easy comp, again we got the $0.02 from fuel that\u2019s going to go away.","So we had a good quarter and solid quarter. We\u2019ll take all the credit for that, but it's just too early to talk about year-end at this point. And again as we get through the year remember we\u2019ve been growing and improving price every quarter sequentially in the past four, five quarters and so as we go through the year and comp the last year, those comps are getting little tougher on year-over-year growth, so just keep that in mind.","Michael Hoffman","Are you retaining more of the price that you're putting in the street this year than you were last year?","Don Slager","We are, we\u2019ve gone out with a little more pricing in the open market and we\u2019ve also gone out pretty strong with price increases this year in the open market to our recycling customers because the market hasn\u2019t held up and to remember this, we already know about what our price is going to be in our restricted base, that is what it is and we\u2019re trying to combat that with the new indices. And again having some pretty good traction there. So I can\u2019t predict today what the open market is going to do into Q3 and Q4. I would like to think that it's going to hold up fine as it did in Q1, so we\u2019re going to continue to maintain the kind of level of actions we\u2019ve taken in Q1.","We\u2019re not going to relax our pricing position and we\u2019re going to continue to expect more from the tools. But lot of extra price you see there is coming from open market actions and a lot of it coming from the recycling business. And we can\u2019t go back and price that again, that was sort of a one type step up.","Michael Hoffman ","You got to clean up the difference between the commodity and what you're charging.","Don Slager","That\u2019s right.","Operator","Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Mr. Slager for his closing remarks.","Don Slager","Thank you, Sheila. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic way. Thank you for spending time with us today, and have a good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Republic Services conference call for today. Thank you for participating.

Slager","Thanks, Ed. We recognize that many of you would like to be with your families this evening and we really appreciate you joining our call today. We will do our best to get you home on time, so let's begin.","Our third quarter performance demonstrates our ability to execute our plans and profitably grow our business. Revenues increased approximately 6%, led by strong volume growth, including higher-margin special waste streams.","Our EBITDA margin performance of 29.5% reflects a sequential improvement from the first half of the year, consistent with the expectations we communicated on our last earnings call.","I will now discuss some financial and operational highlights. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.55. These results include $0.03 of favorable tax items and $0.02 of reduced environmental costs. Including these items, we expect to achieve the high end of our full year EPS guidance.","Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $469 million. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance range of $675 million to $700 million.","Core price in the third quarter was 3.4% and our average yield was 1.3%. Average yield was consistent with the second quarter, even with a sequential step down in CPI-based pricing. We experienced better price contributions from the open market to offset the CPI headwind.","Q3 volumes increased 2.2%. If you include the extra workday, total volumes were up 2.7%. The key drivers of volume growth were C&D roll-off, national accounts and landfill special waste.","Construction activity continues to improve. Temporary roll-off hauls increased 7.4% over the prior year, which reflects the sustained recovery in housing construction. The increase in activity was broad-based with virtually all of our areas reporting growth in temporary hauls per day.","During the quarter, we introduced expanded service offerings to certain National Accounts customers to meet their waste stream needs. We often engage third-party providers to service this work, so it tends to be lower-margin business but has very limited capital requirements. Growth in National Accounts represented about 20% of our volume increase in the quarter.","Landfill special waste volumes were up 5.4% over the prior year which help improved our margin performance. On prior calls, we discussed special waste volumes that were deferred. We are now seeing these event-driven jobs get funded and special waste volumes return to our original expectations.","Landfill MSW is down less than 1%. It is important to note that landfill MSW volume tends to track closely with changes in collection volumes.","Q3 recycling facility tons per day increased 7.4% over the prior year. Most of the increase is related to recycling facilities that we have been -- that we've added or upgraded over the last 3 quarters.","The year-to-date investment in acquisitions was approximately $60 million. Annual revenue is approximately $45 million at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of approximately 4.5x. These transactions consist of tuck-in acquisitions in existing markets. We anticipate completing our goal of investing $100 million by the end of the year.","Approximately 40% of our fleet has completed our One Fleet maintenance initiative and our maintenance cost headwind continues to abate. We expect to have 50% of the fleet completed by mid-2014, at which point we will start realizing benefits.","During the third quarter, we completed our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund. This is a significant accomplishment that benefits our company and our employees. We are happy to report that these 850 employees now participate in financially sound retirement programs.","Year-to-date, we returned $469 million to our stockholders. Dividend payments were $255 million and we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $214 million. Our board recently approved an additional $650 million to our share repurchase authorization. We now have approximately $760 million remaining, which extends through December 2015.","In summary, we delivered results in line with our expectations. And I want to thank the entire Republic team for their hard work and execution.","Glenn and Ed will now discuss our financial performance. Glenn?","Glenn A. Culpepper","Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2013 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $119 million from the prior year. This 5.8% increase in revenue includes acquisitions of 60 basis points and reflects the following 3 components of internal growth: pricing, volume and recycled commodities.","First, pricing. We had an average yield growth of 1.3% with positive yield in all lines of business. Third quarter average yield was consistent sequentially and in line with our expectations. Core price was 3.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially. As a reminder, core price is defined as price increases to customers in changes and fees, excluding fuel recovery net of price decreases.","We saw an increase in open market pricing in the third quarter, which was offset by CPI-based price resets. Beginning in July, price resets started using the lower CPI from 2012 of 2.1% compared to the first half of the year, which was based on the higher 2011 CPI pricing of 3.2%.","Year-to-date, CPI is currently running at approximately 1.5%. Since our price reset tends to lag 12 to 18 months, we will see this lower CPI in our price performance in the second half of 2014. As a result, we expect less price contribution from these contracts next year.","As a reminder, 50% of our revenue has a contractually based pricing restriction and approximately 60% of those contracts have index-based price resets.","Fuel recovery fees increased 0.5%. Most of this change relates to an increase in the rate charge to recover fuel for us [ph] .","Second, third quarter volumes increased 2.2% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.6%, primarily due to an increase in industrial volume. Growth in the industrial line of business was driven by temporary hauls, which were up 7.4% over the prior year.","Landfill volumes were positive 2.6%, which includes an increase in landfill special waste of 5.4%. Our landfill MSW volumes were down 70 basis points.","Our defection rate, which reflects the annualized rate of customer turnover, remained stable at approximately 7%.","In addition to the volume increase of 2.2%, there was one more workday in the quarter, which contributed an additional 50 basis points of revenue growth.","Third, an increase in commodity sales resulted in a 0.7% increase in revenue. The increase in commodity sales reflects both higher prices for recycled commodities and an increase in the tons sold. Commodity prices increased approximately 8% to an average of $117 per ton in the third quarter from $108 per ton in the prior year. This represents the average price for all commodity types across all regions.","Third quarter recycling facility commodity volume of 545,000 tons was up 7.4% from the prior year. Current average commodity prices are approximately $119 per ton. For reference purposes, a $10 per ton change in commodity values equals approximately $0.03 of full year EPS, which includes the impacts on our recycling facility and collection businesses.","Now I will discuss year-over-year margin. Third quarter 2013 adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.5% compared to 29.8% in the prior year, a decrease of 30 basis points.","I will now discuss some specific cost categories. Labor costs increased 30 basis points and maintenance expense increased 20 basis points. These cost increases as a percentage of revenue continue to be impacted by volume growth in the C&D collection business.","Sequentially, the margin headwind on these 2 cost line items was cut in half. This was due in part to higher levels of special waste received in the quarter, which had very little incremental labor and maintenance expense.","Additionally, we continue to anniversary the elevated levels of maintenance expense as we continue to implement our fleet initiative.","Second, transportation and subcontract costs increased 40 basis points, which relates primarily to growth in our National Accounts business and incremental special waste volume.","In the National Accounts business, we employ subcontractors to perform a portion of the work. The costs are a pass-through on these contracts. While incremental EBITDA margin on this work can be in the low- to middle-single digit range. This work generates additional free cash flow and has attractive returns since it has very limited capital requirements.","For special waste, there is often additional third-party transportation to deliver the volumes to our landfills.","Next, fuel. The 40 basis point improvement primarily relates to a higher percentage of natural gas trucks in our fleet. Currently, about 11% of our fleet runs on natural gas. We will continue to replace diesel trucks with natural gas vehicles where appropriate and as part of our normal truck replacement cycle.","The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $3.91 in the third quarter from $3.94 in the prior year, a decrease of approximately 1%. The current average diesel price is approximately $3.87 per gallon. For reference purposes, a $0.20 change in diesel fuel per gallon is about $0.01 of full year EPS, which includes the impact of our fuel recovery fees and fuel hedges.","Landfill operating costs improved 60 basis points. Approximately 50 basis points of the change relates to successfully permitting a new solution for a remediation project in Illinois. As Don mentioned, this provided a $0.02 EPS benefit in the quarter.","Finally SG&A expense was 9.7% of revenue, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Both periods contained adjustments to incentive compensation accruals, which reduced SG&A below 10%.","DD&A as a percentage of revenue was 11.2% in the third quarter of 2013 versus 10.9% in the prior year. The prior year included a benefit related to landfill expansions. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles.","Ed will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data.","Edward A. Lang","Thanks, Glenn. Third quarter 2013 interest expense was $90 million, which included $12 million of noncash amortization. Our third quarter 2013 effective tax rate of 35.2% was favorably impacted by realizing additional federal and state credits on our 2012 tax returns. As Don mentioned earlier, this provided a $0.03 EPS benefit in the third quarter versus our expectations.","Looking forward to 2014, we expect to return to our normal statutory effective tax rate of approximately 39.5%. Our estimated full year 2013 effective tax rate is approximately 36.5%, which assumes a 39.5% rate in the fourth quarter. The increase in tax rate creates a $0.10 EPS headwind year-over-year.","Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $469 million and in line with our expectations. Adjusted free cash flow included net capital expenditures of $689 million or 83% of our projected full year spend. Cash flow can vary quarter-to-quarter, based on the timing of capital expenditures and working capital.","With the expiration of bonus depreciation at the end of 2013, we expect an increase in cash taxes next year. We have not completed our annual planning process, but we anticipate free cash flow will be relatively flat in 2014.","I will now discuss the balance sheet. At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $907 million and our days sales outstanding was 38 days or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7 billion at September 30, and excess availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.5 billion.","I'll now turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Ed. Before we go to Q&A, I would like to address some topics discussed this afternoon in further detail. Glenn discussed that CPI-based pricing will be lower in 2014. We expect to offset this headwind with higher levels of price contribution from our open markets and improved price performance when renewing municipal contracts. We currently anticipate that yield in 2014 will be consistent with current levels.","In order to drive better open market pricing, we are improving pricing decisions made by our sales team at the point-of-sale, enhancing controls for new business sales and service level transactions, better aligning sales incentive programs to drive improved quality of revenue, identifying customer segments and focusing on those willing to pay for our higher-quality service offering and increasing fee participation rates in our cost recovery programs.","I would like to discuss current business conditions and market trends. Business conditions continue to improve. We will enter 2014 with positive yield and positive volume performance. This is the first time this will occur since 2007.","Core price was 3.4% in the quarter, the highest level of performance in over 2 years. We consistently raised prices across each of our businesses.","Over the last several years, our landfill MSW volumes have declined as a result of our pricing actions. We have consistently priced our landfill assets because they are capital intensive and expensive to operate.","Our collection volume growth was concentrated in the industrial business, which includes temporary roll-off. Volumes in this business grew over 4% and yield was up over 2%. Margin in the industrial business improved 90 basis points in the quarter. This demonstrates our ability to achieve volume growth at higher prices.","Generally speaking, there is a high correlation between collection and landfill volumes. In our business, commercial and residential volumes were up less than 1% combined and landfill MSW volumes were essentially flat. At the same time, C&D volumes in the collection and landfill businesses were both up high-single digits in the quarter.","Recycling continues to grow and remains one of our core service offerings. Our recycling business has generally performed in line with our expectations. However, we have experienced higher costs and reduced volumes as a result of Operation Green Fence. Future investment in this line of business will be driven by customer demand, willingness to pay and return on invested capital. Our near-term plan is to focus on operating recent investments and leveraging our third-party network.","We continue to manage the controllable aspects of our business to help mitigate cost increases, including automating residential routes to reduce labor costs and improve productivity; lowering our cost of fuel and reducing emission through conversion to CNG vehicles; and standardizing maintenance practices and processes to reduce costs.","Collectively, we anticipate these initiatives will lower our cost structure by 75 to 100 basis points over the next 3 years.","As a result of our maintenance initiative, we expect that we can effectively extend the useful life of our fleet by approximately 1 year once the majority of the vehicles have been certified. We estimate this will reduce future capital requirements by approximately $200 million spread over a 4- to 5-year period, beginning as early as 2015.","Looking to 2014. We anticipate our normal mid- to high-single digit growth in earnings and free cash flow performance before taking into account to tax-related items that will partially offset this level of performance.","First, an increasing effective tax rate which results in a $0.10 EPS headwind. And second, the exploration of bonus depreciation, which reduces free cash flow by approximately $50 million.","Expected earnings growth in the business, together with tighter controls on capital spending, gives us confidence that we can offset the cash tax headwind from bonus depreciation in 2014.","Our long-term view of the business and strength of our assets has not changed. We still believe that pricing levels exceed cost inflation under normal business conditions, that we gain operating leverage and increased density with broad-based volume growth. We can differentiate our service offerings through superior customer service, world-class safety and employee engagement. We can maintain our pace of tuck-in acquisitions in existing markets. Margins can expand through cost efficiencies, productivity improvements and leveraging SG&A expenses. And finally, ROIC can steadily improve through earnings growth, capital spending controls and investing wisely in the business.","Our team remains focused on executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and cash flow growth. We are committed to an efficient capital structure, maintaining our investment grade rating and increasing cash returns to our stockholders.","At this time, operator, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on volume. Has your strategy changed at all in terms of going after new business now that you're seeing volumes begin to get better? Or how should we think about volume strategy now versus last year when volumes were shrinking? Has there been any change?","Donald W. Slager","No, there really hasn't. Let me walk you through because when you think about volume, we've got to look at it through several different lenses, Hamzah. The first one is on the landfill side. As I said in my comments, we've consistently lost landfill MSW volume over the last 3 years. So we've consistently priced those assets because of the high cost nature of those landfills and we've consistently lost volume for the last several years and so -- by, frankly, a substantial amount. So we continue to price, even in light of that landfill volume loss and those volumes leaving our system and going to other landfills. On the collections side of the business, we made a point a couple of years ago with the fact that there wasn't a lot of organic growth and CPI was low and so on, that we weren't going to surrender our high-quality business during that time and we were going to really hold the line on our volume and we've done that. As volume has returned, again, we're really only seeing organic volume growth in a couple of places, and we mentioned National Accounts, C&D roll-off specifically and special waste has gotten better over the last quarter. So if special waste comes in a pretty good margin, as I mentioned in my comments, we've seen really nice growth in the roll-off system. And we've seen not only volume growth but we've seen pricing improvements and we've seen margin enhancement at the same time. So we're proving that we can improve both volume and price and margin in that system with that kind of growth. So we've been saying for a long time, we think when the economy returns, we're going to see it start with housing formation into construction. At some point, that's going to convert into business formation. And hopefully, we might see some change in service increases and so forth, business formation in the commercial lines and we'd like to see that same performance happen. But we consistently price our business across all lines of businesses, as I've said. Again, we're not walking away from good business, but I think we've demonstrated our willingness to hold the line at the landfill because of the nature of that asset. And also, we've walked away from some substantial municipal business this year and we just couldn't get down in the trenches and lower our prices as much as the competition could, so we're going to see some headwind from that in 2014.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. Very helpful. And just a follow-up. You mentioned tax. When we think about next year's earnings, you talked about price on lower CPI when we think about next year. Anything on the cost side that we should keep in mind in terms of non-recurring or something that is different next year relative to this year?","Donald W. Slager","No, not really. We mentioned -- we're going to continue the major cost initiatives we talked about, the automation, the CNG conversion. The maintenance initiative, we've slowed that down here in the latter half of '14 -- or '13, I'm sorry. So we haven't rolled out any new divisions on One Fleet. We talked about that cost abating year-over-year. We're going to go back and shore up all those divisions that have already gone through the process and get those certified. Ultimately, then, we're going to see that benefit I talked about in the capital spend in our truck fleet out in '15. But nothing other than that. We're sticking to those projects and we think they've got good returns.","Operator","Our next question comes from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","In terms of the pricing data, could you talk about the benefit on the recovery, if you will, from open market business? I mean, how much that helped, maybe it was a swing of the volume because yield actually -- I mean, it came in line where we were looking for, but it seemed like maybe it benefited from special waste. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on the pricing environment.","Donald W. Slager","Yes. Special waste was our -- probably our brightest spot in the quarter, the -- having seen that volume come back after kind of a slow Q2. But we did get a little more ground covered in the open market on pricing. Keep in mind, Al, we've got 7% defection in our permanent commercial and permanent roll-off business in an open market. And so as that business leaves the system, we have to replace it. And, again, we replaced that business to keep our volumes consistent. And that new business comes in at a lower-than-average price. The business that leaves the system leaves at a higher-than-average price and that's churn, all right? So that's consistent. It's not a new phenomenon. We've seen it for many years. It's good that it's held stable at 7%. So we're happy about that. Meanwhile, with the slow CPI environment, we've gone into that open market and we've tried to get just a little more pricing in that open market and we've been pretty successful with it. But it's really on the margin. So that's helped us offset this effect of low CPI and we've been in a low CPI environment now for 3 years. And it doesn't look like we're going to have any relief from that for at least 1 or 2 years.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. So if I think about the lag on CPI, I think about the benefit of volume. To me, the headwind here is how you're going to over -- how you're going to compensate for the price discrepancy between cost inflation and your ability to get price. And while you probably won't comment [ph] , is the headwind here several quarters in your mind? Or how would you maybe characterize that -- framing it in that light?","Donald W. Slager","Well, you got a couple of questions there, Al. The headwind from CPI is real. Our true inflation, net of all the productivity, is a little better than that, a little stronger than that. We've got to continue to hold the line on the quality volume we have. We've got to get a little more creative in other areas of pricing. And I mentioned in my comments, we're working on some initiatives within the sales organization to improve pricing at the point-of-sale to see if we can continue to improve fee participation. There's a number of those things we'll continue to do in '14 to try to tweak a little more price out of the system in the open market that -- where we're not restricted based on the CPI. So we've got our work cut out for us there. But we've got some new tools we're putting to work. We've made some investments in some software to expand the capability of our pricing tool. And we think we'll get some better control and a better outcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Commercial sales, the revenue growth year-over-year seems very healthy. It's calculated at 4.3%. And I'm trying to read through some of your comments, Don, how much of that is where you're winning new business or incrementally, your defection rate or is it just price? I'm not hearing that there's much volume. You said that basically volume was, for all intent and purpose, was flat to 1%.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, the commercial volume, Michael, is only about 1%. We won some new contracts, some new franchise contracts, I guess, that have more commercial business than them. So that's outside of those wins, just normal commercial growth coming in at about that 1% range.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So -- but the 4.3%, then that's a pretty healthy underlying trend there, right? What I was trying to understand is, are we getting service interval upgrades yet? Is that's what working through?","Donald W. Slager","I'm not sure where your 4.3% is coming from because it's...","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Well, unless I did my math wrong, 659 divided by 632 is a 4.3% growth rate year-over-year.","Donald W. Slager","Yes. So -- help me out, guys, 1% volume.","Glenn A. Culpepper","Yes. So, Michael, we've got -- the average yield in the commercial business is about 1.6%. You have the 1% volume and then we have increases FERF as we talked about. That makes [indiscernible] .","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. So you're getting some service upgrades. So that's a nice trend to be seeing is we're getting some service upgrades.","Donald W. Slager","Yes. We're starting to see it. So again, we're -- for a couple of quarters now in a row, service increases are outweighing service decreases. So I think that's -- it's nice to say that for the first time that we've seen that for quarters 2 straight. So we're not declaring victory there yet because it's coming back pretty slowly. But all those trends are kind of pointing in the right direction. And again, just like I talked about in the roll-off business, and we have this trend of seeing volume come back and roll off, and seeing pricing take traction and roll off, as we see more organic volume in commercial and see some service increases coming back, that will help drive the margin in that business for us as well in upcoming years.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I can ask the last person's question a little bit differently. When do you think time-wise? Is it in years, in quarters, that you cover your inflation with price, the reported price that you show us. You call it yield. When do we cover inflation?","Donald W. Slager","Well, again, let's do a little history lesson here, right? If we go back 2006 and 2009, our yield exceeded our cost inflation because we had this sort of average 3.3% CPI environment, okay? The last 3 years, we've had an average 1.6% CPI environment, and we've had to struggle doing that. So we know that at least next year, our CPI is going to be 1.5%. So we don't see much relief coming in '14. And we know, it's this 18-month lag. So we've got that going for us, okay? So I think the strategy still works. The approach we've taken still works. We need to stay vigilant on these cost initiatives we've deployed so far. We need to execute those well. When you get anniversarying this One Fleet initiative into next year, that will start to help us and -- but then, it really all depends really, Michael, on some of the market from there, right? And so what's really going on in this open market? And can we got a little more advantage there? And then it's going to happen -- it's going to matter what happens with landfill pricing. Again, we've lost landfill volume consistently every year for years. And that landfill volume has found a cheaper home and it's going to matter to see what happens there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Corey Greendale with First Analysis.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I was hoping you might be able to frame how we should be thinking about volume and understanding that there's a lot of variables, but given that you're starting to see the service increase levels, should we be thinking that as that increases, you see accelerated volume growth in '13 -- in '14? Or is it more that you've got a strong special waste quarter this quarter? Last quarter, you had wet volume so that we should be thinking about tough comps and maybe a slower volume growth in '14?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. We're really not giving '14 guidance, Corey. We're trying to help you guys understand the exit speed here. We've had some inflection with special waste, which is positive. Again, this inflection in industrial roll-off is a very positive sign. So that's something we can put a stake in the ground on and see continued benefit from. It's a little too early to talk about when commercial is really going to take off for us. This very slightly positive trend in service increases, again very slightly positive, and we'll see where it goes. We still have headwinds in residential. We've seen a lot of price pressure in residential. We've had to take some rollbacks. We're going to take a stronger position on those rollbacks in '14, we think, but we've got still a substantial book of business that's coming for renewal. And we've seen some real competitive behavior there. And we've had to walk away from some business. So that's going to cause a little drag on us. So we're still doing our business plan. And we're still working through all these things. And we'll bring you the full-blown guidance in February, like we always do.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. And you mentioned some pricing initiatives, you were thinking about price in different ways. Your larger competitor talked about some stuff there, thinking of or doing differently in how they're structuring their recycling contracts and surcharging customers for contamination. Just what are your thoughts on structure of recycling contracts?","Donald W. Slager","Well, one, I'd point out our recycling business has actually performed pretty in line with our expectations. So we're not caught offguard there. We would like to see some more benefit accrued to the company with the way recycling contracts operate, better pass-throughs on some of these expenses around Green Fence and so forth could help us. But remember, if recycling volumes come back, we get a pretty big boost from our volumes -- I mean, pricing, we get pretty big boost from these facilities. So we're working with our customers to weave some of this kind of language into our contract. It gives us a little more protection. But this is going to take a long, long time to work through the system. These municipalities are used to buying products a certain way and it's going to take a while for any of those kind of changes to catch on.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","So it sounds like you are theoretically looking at similar things?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. I mean, we always are. We're always looking for ways to improve the balance and make sure that the fairness in that -- in those contracts work for both parties.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I missed some of the call earlier, so I apologize if you went through this detail, but one thing I'm trying to understand is, obviously, the special waste component was a nice benefit in the quarter. Can you just help us understand the improvement that you've seen in the incremental EBITDA this quarter? Maybe how much of that came from the landfill business and specifically special waste?","Edward A. Lang","Joe, this is Ed. We don't really break out or give guidance to EBITDA margin by line of business. I think what we really saw the change in special waste in the quarter. As Don mentioned in his speaker notes, is that we had been awarded a number of projects actually last year. And what we had seen starting probably Q3 of '12 is some of these government-run projects being delayed for various reasons. We have now seen those projects now come back online. One of the larger projects we have right now is a port cleanup in San Diego. But really, what we're seeing now is these projects will occur because they're environmental cleanup. It's just that given some of the political noise we've had over the past year, they had been delayed. But we see those projects coming free and we're getting that revenue now, which you would view as special waste on a recurring basis like our E&P business. We did not really see any disruption in those volumes at all. It was really some of this event work, kind of environmental cleanup that had been delayed, but we definitely see these projects coming back into the pipeline.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just one more quick one. Switching gears to the National Account component. I know that you guys kind of comped the large last customer that left last year. Can you just maybe talk to the strategy on the National Account side, maybe what's driving the success here? And do you think it continues to grow at a nice pace or is it going to continue to be lumpy?","Donald W. Slager","Well, I think it's going to grow at a reasonably steady pace going forward. We're frankly less interested these days in those really super large accounts because they tend to be a little more volatile. Maybe we learned that lesson. So we're still focused a little bit more on -- with some of the regional customers, some of the accounts that we're closer to. We're also expanding our share of wallet with those same customers and doing more for them. And so we talked about the fact that we're doing more business that requires us to broker. We're handling their white goods or their recyclables. We're the contractor, then we hire a subcontractor to do some of that work. So we're -- again, we're working to add more value and improve the service offering with those customers to be their waste stream expert, so to speak. And so we're going to continue to focus on -- it's good business, it's got a good return and it is one of the areas that we think will grow for some time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","On the residential competition you talked about, is that surprising to you at all? I mean, with housing getting a little bit better, you might think that, that would actually benefit that market. But maybe...","Donald W. Slager","Yes. I think we got this state of municipal finance that's been weak and we've talked about a lot of that. You look at some of the data that's out there, about the condition of the general fund in these cities and the way their tax base has been affected over the years. It doesn't surprise me that cities are looking for discounts, it does surprise me that some of the pricing we've seen by some of the players out there and really more some of those smaller, regional and those kind of companies. But they're capitally-intensive deployments with all the CNG requirements now. They put contracts on automation, everything else they want. Cities are asking for a lot more services without wanting to pay a lot more price. And at some point, we just have to draw the line because we've got to get that ROI moving in the right direction for the organization. So we're going to take a few hits there and we're also using that tough environment to battle back and actually use some privatization work. So we've had a couple of nice privatization wins in the year, albeit smaller ones. I'm not sure they're going to be able to offset the revenue loss in total.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. So I'm still a little bit iffy on the -- what the volume outlook is. It almost sounds like Q3 might be a near-term high for volume growth. Is that the right read?","Donald W. Slager","I think, I said, we're going to enter Q4 -- enter next year with positive volume, positive price for the first time since '07. So I think we've got good trend going. We're -- we found, I think, the basement in commercial, kind of bump it along even a little positive. We've got this boost in industrial, which has performed well not only the volume but the pricing and margin. Landfill is hard for us. As I said, we've lost virtually all of our third-party competitive MSW volume. So we don't get the benefit of that volume but we also don't get the benefit of those customers when they grow their volume. So that's going to work against us a little bit. But all in all, I mean, it's a pretty good story. We need to work through some of these costs where, as we talked about, controlling the capital. And in this tough CPI environment, it's kind of the tail that wags the dog for us, when half of our business is restricted. So we have to work through '14's CPI environment.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Well, I wanted to go back to the pricing line of questioning for '14. I want to confirm something before I ask the question. You said a couple of times that 50% of your business is linked to CPI. But I also thought you said that 60% of that 50% would actually be directly impacted by the reset in CPI...","Donald W. Slager","Yes, that's right. So 50% is indexed and 60% of that 50% -- you're right. Nevertheless, it's a pretty big chunk.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's a pretty big chunk. Okay, got you. And then what are you saying the headwind then would be from residential business that is up for a renewal and it's not just a CPI adjustment there, it might be something more than that? I mean, what will that be for 2014? Do you have a sense for that?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. Again, we're not trying to dial too much into '14 on this call. We're trying to give you kind of where we are through the year and how we're going to end the year. We're still working through the business plan to getting through all that. We -- as I said, we're going to work harder on those renewals. And we're going to take a stronger position on the rollbacks. We're still going to protect volume that has a high return. And we're going to have the discipline to walk away from volume that doesn't have an appropriate return. We can't keep throwing capital and additional service into some of these contracts that don't have the return criteria that we need to move forward. So we think that's been spiraling down over the last several years. We're probably halfway through that book of business. And we would like to see it spiral back up. But we've got to get the work done and business plan to get a better handle on where we think it's going to come off in '14.","Edward A. Lang","Alex, in a typical year, as far as municipal contracts coming up for renewal, generally, is in a range of $300 million to $350 million. So essentially, we have to -- we'll be employing this discipline as we look at those renewals.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, guys. And just my last question on the pricing side. So what's the implied price that you need to get on the open market, not CPI business, to be able to keep average yield at around 1.5%? I mean, how does that compare to history? Is there potential upside to that if we are seeing volumes grow?","Donald W. Slager","Well, as far as our pricing actions go, we've been pretty consistent through this year compared to last year. We plan to be consistent with our pricing actions into '14, only that we're going to get a little smarter around some of the -- when you talk about some of the pricing tools that we're using and see if we can, at the point of quoting our customers, work a little harder on some of the fringe like the fees and some of the other things that push the open market pricing up and try to do a little better job on demonstrating the value to customers. So we're looking to slow the rollback. We're looking to impact some of the churn. But if you think about it, maybe it's a 50\/50 split, right?","Edward A. Lang","And we accomplished that here in the third quarter, meaning we started to see the lower CPI roll into our numbers beginning July 1 and we were able to make up what we lost there with price increases in the open market. So we're getting the job done today.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And if I can just ask one more. It's interesting, it seems like as we move through the year, your temporary roll-off business seems to be very exposed to housing has strengthened even though looking at the macro housing data, it's actually softened. I'm curious if you have any thoughts on that disconnect and what that may be related to?","Donald W. Slager","Well, I think that's just the lag, the natural lag. When you read about housing starts and then you see the production of waste from that construction, it just lags. So I think that's what we're experiencing today. I would tell you, we think we're getting our fair share of that business...","Edward A. Lang","At a higher price.","Donald W. Slager","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stewart Scharf with S&P Capital IQ.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","Can you talk a little about the natural gas trucks, fleet, how things are going, your rate of conversion and also, on your fueling stations? Are you looking to profit or could you quantify how much of the fueling stations will be -- what percentage will be used for outside fleets other than Republic Services? And how much could you -- you could earn on that?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. Stewart, we're -- currently, 11% of our fleet is on natural gas vehicles. We have a fleet of 15,000 trucks. We buy about 1,000 trucks per year as our replacement program. And we've been buying about half CNG trucks and about half diesel. So we're kind of upping that percentage, if you like, 3% or 3.5% per year. And as far as the fueling stations, we use it only for our own trucks. We don't fuel anybody else's.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","So you have no plans to share that, share the fueling stations?","Donald W. Slager","No, no. Because if you think about it, we have to fuel our trucks every day. And we do that in the evening, when the trucks are idle and there's no -- we have no plans to be a retailer of fuels.","Edward A. Lang","We view our investment in the natural gas infrastructure as being a competitive advantage and we don't want to share that with other folks.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","How many fueling stations do you have right now?","Edward A. Lang","25, plus or minus.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","25. And they cost roughly $1 million per station?","Edward A. Lang","It depends on the size, $1.5 million to $2 million. You also have to realize you have a different maintenance environment. So there are some other changes which need to occur. And really, from a safety perspective, you don't really want folks that are not part of Republic coming on the property. We're not a fuel retailer. We're in the business of solid waste management.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Capital IQ Equity Research","And what's the hurdle rate? What are you looking for ROI in that kind of investment, based on the...","Glenn A. Culpepper","It's in the mid-teens. We have the payback of 3 to 4 years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Barbara Noverini with MorningStar.","Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","What are some of the factors that make Republic Services a more competitive vendor to a National Accounts worth? I know you haven't mentioned much about National Accounts in a couple quarters and we're seeing some nice improvement in the quarter. So I'm wondering if maybe your strategy has changed, maybe you're better equipped to satisfy demand for recycling from these customers now that you've added some capacity into your network.","Donald W. Slager","Well, I think what matters to National Account customers is, as I used the term earlier, they're looking for somebody to be their waste expert, somebody who can understand all the aspects of the waste stream and help them manage them. So whether that is recycling, diversion of white goods, all those kinds of things, the things we do. Reporting is important to large customers, who have a distributed network. They want access to data that helps them understand what's going on at their locations. And so that's an important aspect. We've got customer service tools, our portal that they can access their information and manage their information online through our system. So those are the kind of things that we incorporate into our presentations to customers. They get really good service. And we've got a third-party hauler network in those markets that we don't serve to help us out, to give us that broad reach. So all in all, I think we do a good job for them. And we're finding other ways to meet their needs, albeit some of those new ways don't really require our capital, our brick-and-mortar, but we're finding with opportunities through other alliances and other third-party networks to meet their needs and just be their go-to company and sort of take the worries off of their plate. So that's what we do for our customers. And we'll continue to find those accounts that -- and customers that see the value in them.","Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Got you. Would you be able to provide some sort of ballpark with the recycling business that does come from these customers? Are you able to handle most of it or do you need to rely on a third-party network to take the majority of it?","Donald W. Slager","Well, we're not in the, for instance, the e-waste business. We haven't built any infrastructure around that. So when it comes to certain slices of the waste stream, we work through alliances. We don't have -- we're not in the medical waste business so -- even though we have alliances for that. So what we try to do is stick with the, what we call, traditional recycling, the fiber, which is the highest content of the waste stream. And that's where we play with our own people and our own trucks. And then we rely on these other partners to help us fill in the gaps.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Osborne with Stifel.","Jeffrey D. Osborne - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Most everything's been answered here. Just 2 quick ones for me. One is I wonder if you could just touch on what you're seeing in the M&A environment for 2014 as we exit the year? And then the special waste business, obviously, a bright spot here in the third quarter, a bit erratic to start the year. Just what's the trajectory here, as we head into the fourth quarter and early next year?","Donald W. Slager","Well, on the M&A side, as I said in my comments, we think that we've got a couple more years of spending, about $100 million in spend to buy good companies at that same multiple and in tuck-in environments, so in cities and markets we're already in. We're looking at collection companies and occasionally some infrastructure that helps fill out our network. So we've got a pretty good pipeline and we haven't seen multiples necessarily change. We're always looking for good companies and we think we've got the ability to continue to do that. On the special waste side, as Ed said, the business can be a little lumpy but more so on the event-driven business. So again, what we saw happen in Q3 was sort of picking up some of that pent-up demand that was deferred from Q2. So we think that will even out in Q4 and then settle down to be as good as average or better than average in '14.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Slager for his closing remarks.","Donald W. Slager","Thank you, Lisa.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Ed, good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we discuss Republic Services 2012 results and 2013 guidance. As I look back over 2012 performance, I'm proud of the Republic team and how in spite of a less than favorable economy, we executed on our long-term strategy and maintained our track record of generating strong cash flows from the business. Consistent with our balanced approach to cash utilization, we reinvested in the business and returned a significant portion of free cash flow to our owners, which included dividends of $329 million. We raised the dividend approximately 7%, demonstrating our practice of steadily increasing dividends. Our dividend payout, as a percentage of free cash flow, was approximately 43%.","We repurchased 11.8 million shares for $325 million in 2012, which was consistent with our plan. We have $324 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete in 2013. Over the past 9 quarters, we have repurchased approximately 8% of the company's outstanding shares.","In 2012, we returned approximately $655 million to our stockholders. This translates to a cash yield of approximately 6.3%, which is the highest in the industry. Additionally, we completed approximately $100 million of acquisitions, our highest level of investment in 4 years. These acquisitions have run rate revenue of $65 million and EBITDA of $23 million. We continue to work on additional transactions and expect to maintain this pace of acquisitions in 2013. Our financial flexibility enables us to complete these accretive transactions and gives us the capacity we need to pursue future deals.","I will now discuss some of the other financial and operational highlights from 2012. We recorded revenue of approximately $2 billion in Q4 2012. Core price growth in the quarter was 1.1%, which was in line with our expectations. Net price increase to customer, defined as price increases less rollbacks, was 3.2% in the fourth quarter. Volumes decreased by 0.8%, which is made up of growth in collection business, offset by a decline in the post collection business. Our collection business grew 0.9% versus the prior year, which includes 5.8% increase in temporary roll off hauls. Within the post collection business, the majority of the volume decline can be attributed to contract losses that we have previously discussed and lower special waste streams.","Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.37, this includes a remediation charge for a closed landfill of $37 million, or $0.06 in EPS. Excluding this charge, our EPS would have been $0.43. Full year 2012 adjusted free cash flow was $768 million, which was in line with our expectations. Full year 2012 adjusted free cash flow per share was $2.09 or approximately 16% higher than our adjusted full year EPS of $1.80. This demonstrates the strong cash flow characteristics of our business. We saw continued growth in our recycling business. Q4 recycling facility tons increased approximately 3.5% over the prior year. Our safety performance continues to improve with a 3% favorable reduction in our frequency rate.","I will now discuss our 2013 financial guidance. Consistent with prior practice, our guidance is based on a current economic condition and assumes fuel and recycled commodity prices remain at current levels for the full year. We expect 2013 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.86 to $1.91. Our guidance assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 38%. We anticipate 2013 adjusted free cash flow in a range of $675 million to $700 million.","We expect annual revenue growth of 2% to 2.5%, with core price improving 1% to 1.5%, acquisition growth of approximately 1% and relatively flat volumes. We expect volumes to remain slightly negative in the first half of the year until we anniversary the contracts lost in 2012 and expect to achieve positive volume growth in the second half of the year. Our EBITDA margin guidance is approximately 29%.","2013 capital expenditures are expected to be $860 million and $835 million net of expected proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Our guidance for EPS and free cash flow represents high-single-digit growth after excluding the impact of a higher effective tax rate and higher cash taxes. This level of growth demonstrates the strength of our business, which is well-positioned to take advantage of an improving economy.","Before I turn the call over to Glenn to discuss our 2012 financial performance, I would like to take a moment to thank Tod Holmes for his steady leadership, his financial stewardship and guidance. As you know, Tod retired last month after serving as our CFO for 15 years. We honored him and his wife, Anne, earlier this week at a retirement dinner with our Board of Directors. We'll certainly miss Tod, but we are thrilled for him and Anne, and we wish them the best in their retirement.","With that, I'm pleased to introduce Glenn Culpepper, our Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. Glenn has a deep financial background and experience at large decentralized growth-oriented industrial companies. Glenn has more than 30 years of broad-based financial experience, including 17 years in the CFO role. Glenn joins us from Summit Materials, a leading business in the aggregates and building materials sector. Before that, he spent 20 years -- 21 years at CRH plc, a large publicly traded multinational construction materials company based in Dublin, Ireland.","Glenn and Ed will now discuss our 2012 financial performance and provide more details on the 2013 guidance.","Glenn A. Culpepper","Thank you, Don. I'm pleased to be part of Republic Services. We have an outstanding business with great assets. Our management is focused on building on its core strengths, and is committed to delivering returns to our customers. I look forward to working with the team to continue to execute on these principles in the future.","Now I will discuss financial results for the quarter. Fourth quarter 2012 revenue was approximately $2 billion and reflects the following 3 components of internal growth: pricing, volume and recycled commodities.","First on pricing. We had core price growth of 1.1%, with positive price in all lines of business. Core price increased 10 basis points sequentially from 1% in Q3 to 1.1% in Q4. Consistent with our expectations, pricing was higher in the second half of the year, which reflects the higher level of price resets to our index-based customers. In addition, fuel recovery fees increased 0.2%. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel increased to $4.02 in Q4 from $3.87 in the prior year, an increase of 4%.","Second, on volumes. They decreased 0.8% year-over-year. As Don indicated, collection volumes were positive, 0.9%. This level of collection volume represented a 60 basis point sequential increase from our Q3 performance. Most of the improvement is coming from the commercial and industrial lines of business. The growth in collection is offset by a decline in landfill and transfer station volumes. Within the landfill business, special waste decreased approximately 9% listed from prior year and landfill MSW volumes were down approximately 5%.","The decline in landfill MSW volumes relates primarily to the previously discussed loss municipal disposal contracts and competitive pressures in our Los Angeles market. Our Q4 2012 volume performance also reflects a 30 basis point increase in revenue from an additional work day.","Third, a decrease in commodity sales resulted in a 0.8% decrease in revenue. Commodity prices decreased approximately 13% to an average of $109 per ton in Q4 from $125 per ton in the prior year. Q4 recycling facility commodity volume of 527,000 tons was up 3.5% from the prior year. Our 2013 guidance is based on current commodity prices of approximately $112 per ton. For reference purposes, a $10 per ton change in commodity values equals approximately $0.03 of full year EPS, which includes the impact on our recycling facility in collection businesses.","Turning to fourth quarter year-over-year margin. Q4 2012 adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4% compared to 29.8% in the prior year, a 340 basis point decrease. Of this  change, 180 basis points relates to the remediation charge Don discussed, 40 basis points relates to net fuel and commodity and about 30 basis points relates to the work day increase. Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately 29%.","The more significant items that comprise the margin change are, first, labor. The 90 basis point increase in expense relates to the revenue mix between the collection and post-collection businesses and an increase in the number of workdays. Collection volumes, which have increased have associated labor costs while post-collection volumes, commodity revenues and subcontract revenues are all down and these all have little or no variable labor cost. Within those collection lines of business, direct labor costs as a percentage of revenue remained relatively flat.","Second, maintenance. The 50 basis point increase in maintenance expense also primarily relates to the changes in revenue mix and workdays that I just discussed. As a percentage of revenue, maintenance declined to 8.4% from 8.5% in the third quarter. We are beginning to anniversary the implementation costs of our maintenance initiative, as well as the broad-based tire cost increases in 2012.","Third, fuel. The 30 basis point increase in expense is due to a 4% increase in the cost of diesel. After considering the impact of related fuel recovery fees, there was a net margin decline of 20 basis points. Our 2013 guidance is based on the current cost of diesel of approximately $4.02 per gallon. For reference purposes, a $0.20 change in diesel fuel per gallon is about $0.01 of full year EPS, which includes the impact of our fuel recovery fees and our fuel hedges.","Fourth, landfill operating costs. The 180 basis point increase in expense relates to a $37 million remediation charge for environmental conditions at a closed landfill in Missouri. As Don mentioned earlier, this charge resulted in a $0.06 reduction in EPS in the fourth quarter. Excluding this charge, landfill operating costs as a percentage of revenue were essentially flat with the prior year.","Last on cost of goods sold. The 40 basis point improvement relates to a reduction in rebates paid for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold decreased to an average of $28 per ton from $41 per ton in the prior year. While the change in cost was favorable, when you consider the more significant decrease in related commodity revenues, there was a 20 basis point decline in EBITDA margin.","With respect to SG&A, our fourth quarter 2012 SG&A was 10.2% of revenue. This improvement of 40 basis points primarily relates to cost savings from the reorganization of our field operations and corporate office in the fourth quarter of 2012, and a reduction in incentive compensation expense. Our annual run rate SG&A is approximately 10% of revenue.","DD&A as a percentage of revenue was 11.6% in Q4 2012, versus 11.5% in the prior year. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles.","Ed will now discuss interest expense, taxes and free cash flow.","Edward A. Lang","Thanks, Glenn. Q4 2012 interest expense was $92 million, which included $12 million of noncash amortization. Our 2013 EPS guidance includes total interest expense of approximately $365 million. This includes noncash interest of approximately $45 million. The full year 2012 effective tax rate included in our adjusted EPS was 32.2%. This rate reflects the benefit from favorably settling open tax years. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 38% in 2013, which can vary from quarter-to-quarter. There is a $0.17 EPS headwind as a result of a higher tax rate in 2013 when compared to 2012.","I will now discuss free cash flow. Full year 2012 adjusted free cash flow was $768 million, in line with our expectations. As Don mentioned, our guidance for 2013 adjusted free cash flow is in the range of $675 million to $700 million. This guidance includes the impact from the recent extension of bonus depreciation for tax purposes. As a result of the changes in the net impact of bonus depreciation and favorable settlements in 2012 that are not expected to repeat, there is a year-over-year increase in cash taxes of approximately $150 million.","In 2013, there is a negative impact of bonus depreciation of approximately $50 million when you consider the favorable impact of the end year bonus depreciation being more than offset by the cumulative impact from prior years. Bonus depreciation is a timing issue and once a deduction has been taken for tax purposes, it is no longer available. Since bonus depreciation has been in effect since 2008, there is very little tax shield available from prior years. Bonus depreciation will impact our free cash flow performance for the next 4 to 5 years.","Now I'll discuss the balance sheet. At December 31, our accounts receivable balance was $837 million and our days outstanding was 38 days, or 23 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7.1 billion at December 31. And excess credit available under our bank facility was approximately $1.4 billion.","I will now turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Ed. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to address the recent discussion about the solid waste industry moving to a REIT type structure. Now, I want to be very clear about this. We have reviewed the matter internally and with outside tax advisors. We have concluded that under current IRS guidelines, these types of structures do not work for Republic on a technical tax basis, as well as for strategic business reasons. As a matter of policy, we do not publicly discuss tax planning strategies that we considered to be proprietary.","In 2013 we're going to focus on what -- our attention on what we do best and that's executing our long-term strategy of profitably growing and operating our North American solid waste and recycling businesses. We will accomplish this by continuing our pricing programs and utilizing our ROI-based tools; growing the business through sales, acquisitions and investments in recycling and processing capability; enhancing the customer experience by continuously improving our service delivery and differentiating our service offering; managing our cost structure through programs designed to gain operational efficiencies, including food automation, CNG conversion and standardized maintenance practices; investing in our people, building our talent and improving team engagement; being responsible stewards of the planet and its resources and maintaining our Investment Grade rating.","In summary, our strategy has not changed. It is designed to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth. We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our stockholders through share repurchase and dividends. At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Corey Greendale, with First Analysis.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","First, wanted to ask about the guidance. And last quarter you provided some kind of initial thoughts on the year and it sounds like the EPS range you're giving here is a little lower than that and the free cash flow it would bring is a little higher and I just wondered if you can bridge what the reasons are for the differential?","Donald W. Slager","Well, our preliminary outlook that we provided last quarter is sort of encased in this -- I think we gave you $1.90 to $1.92 as preliminary outlook, and we're now saying $1.86 to $1.91. So we're still in that range. We had a little softness in special wastes that we built into our plan and for 2013 I would tell you that, that makes up the bulk of it.","Edward A. Lang","And on the cash flow story, we originally talked about $650 million and was bringing that number up to the $675 million to $700 million is the in-year benefit from the extension of bonus depreciation for calendar '13. And also keep in mind when we talked on the November 1 call, that was more of a preliminary outlook not detailed guidance because we had not completed our full year budget planning process. So it was just kind of a preliminary outlook, not the financial guidance, which we're providing today.","Donald W. Slager","That's right.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Understand. And then a question on the pricing front, I was just wondering if you can just speak to kind of sequential trends in competitive markets. And then how should we be thinking about the quarterly trend in 2013 in CPI increases, it's more of a issue where it gets better as the year goes on, or does it flatline or go the opposite direction?","Donald W. Slager","Well, we're talking about sequential first, right? So we've had now 2 quarters sequentially of 1% plus core price. So that's a good thing coming off where we were and sort of 50 basis points for a few quarters prior. So trending up, again we're giving you guidance from 1% to 1.5% for the full year. We're going to have a little bit of a headwind in CPI later in the year and the second half will start to kind of show up in the following year. Overall, I think the trends are pretty consistent with what we've seen. We don't see the market deteriorating maybe getting a little better, but we're going to continue doing what we do best and that is, again, as I said in my comments, using ROI tools and pricing consistently in the business.","Edward A. Lang","And then on the restricted price, or the index based markets, we still see the calendar 2011 CPI influencing our restricted market pricing in the first half of this year and then the calendar '12 CPI number will come in, in the second half of the year.","Donald W. Slager","Remember, we continue to remind you guys, it takes 12 or 18 months for that CPI to run through our business the way our contracts are structured.","Edward A. Lang","Correct. And the CPI for calendar '12 was just a little bit above 2%. So with the combination of the open market pricing and then the restricted market pricing, we're giving guidance to 1% to 1.5%.","Operator","The next question comes from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just a follow on. I was hoping maybe you could comment a little more granularity about the competitive market, because if you have 40% and about 2% price, it seems very challenged to get price in the other components of your business if you're guiding 1% to 1.5% I realize it's up. But it still seems like we're having some choppiness in the markets, is that fair?","Edward A. Lang","Well, I think what you have to also factor in to the restricted marking -- market pricing, is the pressure we've talked about through last year on the renewals of the municipal contracts. Although, the contracts that are in midstream are being influenced by last year's CPI, keep in mind as contracts come up for renewal, given the state of municipal finance, we are seeing some lower pricing levels, on average on those contract renewals. So although you're getting the 2% as I mentioned in the second half of this year on the existing business, you have to kind of look at it on a net basis and factor in the fact that typically on an annual basis, we have about $350 million of municipal revenue renewing. And so on a net basis, we're coming up to that 1% to 1.5%.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Don, I think, your recap of the growth initiatives, at least for '13 has a nice lead into, a, the announcements you made today. And then second, there has been in the press and I think it was in one of your larger markets about recycling and some of the cost involved there. So maybe to the extent you want to talk about any one of those particular contracts, great. Although, generally, its heaven. But maybe, you can talk through what you're seeing on the recycling side in terms of the growth?","Donald W. Slager","Well, let me start, Al, by kind of saying that the business -- this business doesn't move at a rapid pace. So when you set out a plan to invest in a certain area or move into initiative, it takes a number of years to roll into it. So if we take the privatization in Flint, Michigan that you were referring to -- Ed mentioned, the pressure we're getting in the municipal renewal with the state of municipal finance, we're having some price pressure there. The same thing that's causing that price pressure, I think is causing some municipalities to rethink whether they should hire somebody like Republic Services to do the trash and recycling service. So we're going to put continued effort into that area of privatization and we'll continue to plow that ground. We don't have a lot of that built it into our pipeline, or into our -- even our plan, but we got a few of those that we're working through and will continue to see some wins there, I think, over the next several years. As rates to recycling, we've talked about this a lot and we've got 25 markets that we think we need to invest in across our 240 markets. And we do that to the tune of 3 to 5 markets a year. So just like we've done for the last 2 years in 2013, we'll invest in several markets to further build our recycling capability and answer the customer demand and to be competitive and broaden our service offering in the market. So it's a very steady pace of change and a very steady pace, but a focused pace.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Could you just comment -- I know we wanted to limit questions here, but on that point, have the economics changed at all? Because I know you were, at least, heeding us to be a little conservative on the economics around recycling given...","Donald W. Slager","Remember we told you when we look at those contracts, we -- and we perform on those investments, we look at the 10-year average. And right now, the commodity prices are right near the 10-year average. So over the cycle, we think those investments still makes sense as I said, Al,  we are not moving at a rapid pace. We're spending a portion of our capital budget every year. It's the right thing to do for the customer base. It's the -- it's answering customer demand and we're moving, I think, at the right pace. The investments all have a good return.","Operator","Bill Fisher, with Raymond James.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Don, just on the special waste you mentioned. Is the bidding environment -- is it just more aggressive? Are there less jobs out there? Or do you see a potential where there are some more bids later in the year that might change all that?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. It feels like it's just the event business, Bill, just people deferring jobs and maybe their discretionary budgets being tightened. So that's not unusual to see that in the second half of the year when people are uncertain about what their next year looks like for some of our customers. But again, as we said in our comments, every year, when we bring guidance forward, we can only kind of base it on what we know today. So when we look at the current state of special waste, the current state of commodities, the current state of fuel, we bake that into our guidance. Could it get better? Sure, it could. But we're seeing a slowdown here in Q4 and we're kind of baking that into, at least the first half of this year and we'll see how the pipeline treats us.","Edward A. Lang","I think we saw a kind of historic in Q3 and continue into Q4 and I think it would be consistent with the general news that you saw about some of the trimming of corporate capital expenditure budgets and even some of the government spending given when you go back to the second half of last year some of the political and economic uncertainty heading into year end. So it's not like these projects have been canceled. Generally the folks who had awarded us the business are just telling us it's been deferred, but until the business actually comes into the revenue stream, we're not going to put it into our budget or our forecast.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And just following up on Q4, your labor and maintenance costs were up like mid-single digits and I think you had an extra day in there, but just looking at '13, do you see some of that easing off a bit with like the One Fleet on the maintenance side? Or how would you look at those costs?","Glenn A. Culpepper","Yes. We're seeing -- Bill, this is Glenn. We're seeing a slowdown in our maintenance cost increases. And actually, in the fourth quarter, it was lower as a percentage of revenue than the third quarter. And we'll see more of that, we believe, in 2013. And on the labor, it's going to move with our volumes on the collections side of the business,  we hope to do more, if we do, there will be labor costs associated with that.","Donald W. Slager","So on the maintenance initiatives, by the end of this year, we'll have -- by end of '13, we'll have about half the fleet addressed. As I said, we've kind of stretched that to maybe a 4-plus year program. So we'll have half the fleet address. We've anniversary-ed the uptick and then we'll start to see the longer the new maintenance practices are in place, we'll start to see the benefits start to come in as we start to impact the second half of the fleet in the out years.","Operator","Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Mortgage (sic) [Markets].","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I wanted to ask about C&D volumes. Are you seeing any pick up in roll off activity?","Donald W. Slager","Yes so we said in the comments that our temporary roll off business hauls, venture and hauls, was up over 5% in Q4 year-over-year. But it's coming off of a very low base. So when it comes to construction and demolition, construction specifically, we're very late cycle. And so we're pretty excited about the 5% uptick. But it's coming off a pretty low base. So we'll continue to be late cycle, that's just the way our business is and we'll continue to get our fair share of that growth as it comes through the pipeline.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And then, were there any impacts to your business from Hurricane Sandy in the quarter?","Donald W. Slager","Not really to speak of. We're not heavily engaged in that part of the country. We had some -- a few impacts in New Jersey. But you know how all those things work, is they cost you a little bit of money upfront, with revenue interruptions and service interruptions and some additional cost to run your facilities without power and such and then you make a little bit of money on the backhand. But net-net of net, you don't really make out too well. So it's about net even for us.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And lastly, I just wanted to ask, I mean, Commercial and Industrial revenue is up really nicely year-over-year in Q4. I mean, are those kinds of growth rates sustainable?","Donald W. Slager","Well I guess some of that is anniversary-ing some losses, et cetera. We've got that baked into our guidance. We've got some continued anniversary-ing of some volume in the first half of the year, some contracts we lost last year and then it starts to come back to us in the second half. So it\u2019s probably too early to tell on construction and demolition and some of these things, but directionally, it's good. And I would tell you that we feel better about where it's heading coming into this year than we have in the last couple of years.","Operator","Next question comes from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital markets.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a question on your mix shift toward collection. I appreciate the comments that were made earlier on labor in the quarter. I guess just going forward, based on what you could see in the macro right now, is the mix issue something that's likely to be an ongoing headwind? Or is it maybe a quarter or 2 blip until we see, maybe the landfill situation reverse in L.A.?","Edward A. Lang","Well, Joe, I would say, seeing increasing activity in any line of business, we would view as being a positive, not in any way a negative. So I think the increasing versus the volumes we're seeing in the collection business is a reflection of a little bit better economic activity. Their results we're seeing from our marketing efforts and what we would view in total as a positive. I also think the blend of, say, collections and post-collection, or disposal revenue is also kind of reflecting, as Don had in his speaker notes. We did lose a number of larger disposal contracts earlier in calendar '12 and we just haven't anniversary-ed those numbers yet. And then second, is as we discussed on a previous question, a little bit lower, what we would identify as event special waste streams, those tied to corporate capital spending or some type of government related work were being deferred in the second half of 2012. So on a net basis, the revenue mix were shifting a little bit and just the fact that collection is a little bit more labor-intensive will impact some of the average cost items. But if the event work comes back, then I think things will just rebalance to a previous level.","Donald W. Slager","And those large contracts that we lost, that we mentioned about 9 months ago, they all anniversary out by the end of June. So we go into Q3 with that behind us.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. I appreciate that. A question for you on your automated arm conversion, I mean, you guys seem to be making, maybe, the most visible push with this initiative and I certainly understand it\u2019s a major productivity tool. I'm just kind of curious, is it having maybe any unforeseen impact on your landfill volume?","Donald W. Slager","Well, the landfill volumes' more impacted by the conversion to a multi-cart system and one sort capability when you give a customer a 90 gallon cart for recycling versus an 18 gallon bin that they maybe had previously. Automation is first and foremost aimed at the waste collection side and then supplemented with the expansion of our recycling business. So productivity is #1 gain, driver safety, driver engagement, broadly the hardened demographic, all those are really good things. The customers like the carts. So it's got a good -- it adds to our customer experience. And then as we add a cart for recycling and so on, it does drive the recycling volumes up, which is what the customers want to see. So that's all built into our plan. When we look at investments in recycling, we look at the market pre-investment and the vertically integrated market post-investment and these investments make sense to us.","Edward A. Lang","And just to [indiscernible], we exited 2012 with approximately 62% of the residential fleet being automated. We do plan to buy, or convert, over another 200 routes in calendar '13. So at that pace, we should exit '13 with approximately 66% or about 2\/3 of the residential system being automated.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. Just one more clarification, I apologize if I missed this earlier. So on the $37 million environmental charge in the quarter, should we think about that as a recurring item to a certain degree? And do you guys have any additional charges for the landfill included in your 2013 guidance?","Edward A. Lang","No. It's a remediation charge. So essentially, there is a process we conduct internally with both internal and external engineering group. That work is then also reviewed by our outside auditors and their engineering staff and it is viewed as a one-time item, so that we incur that as an expense in the current quarter, but it will be spent over multiple years. So although we do take the charge in a single quarter from a cash flow perspective, it's extended. The payment is over a multiyear period.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay. But on the...","Edward A. Lang","But it's not a recurring charge.","Operator","Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just to follow-up on that last question, the remediation charge. I believe this is the second quarter in a row that we've had a remediation charge. And so, as we think about your outlook for 2013, are you including any potential remediation charges on that number?","Edward A. Lang","No. The answer is, you're right. It is the second quarter that we've done this. There was further engineering work done that necessitated the additional $37 million charge. But we do a full engineering review at all of our landfills annually and out of that process, we do not see any other remediation cost in '13.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just to get back to the discussion around C&D volumes. At the end of 2012, can you tell us what percentage of your volumes would be exposed to the C&D market? And as you think about your 2013 volume outlook, are you factoring in any volume growth in the C&D category at this point? Are you going to leave that as potential upside to your expectations?","Edward A. Lang","Well, no. We don't factor in any type of economic outlook or forecast into the financial guidance we've provided today. As far as the revenue contribution on the collection side, the C&D or collection and demolition work represents between 6% and 7% of our total revenue. And then probably between 2% and 3% on the landfill side where we're taking debris from other haulers. So in total, it's kind of high single-digit of our total revenue. I think that the conferences we've attended, we have spoken in the past at the peak of the economic cycle, say, in the '05, '06 period, C&D both collection and disposal, it was about 17% of the revenue and then at a trough, which was probably late '09, first half of '10, it was about 7% of our revenue. So we're obviously up off the trough. But still down significantly from the peak of the economy that we saw in '05, first half of '06.","Donald W. Slager","Our guidance is based on what we know today about the economy and as it changes and\/or improves. We'll be talking to you about it quarter-by-quarter.","Operator","Next comes from Hamzah Mazari, with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Don, given how much the REIT landscape has changed, as you know, maybe help us understand what is your downside in going and seeking out a no name private letter ruling? As you know, there's nothing black and white with REIT conversions, particularly recently.","Donald W. Slager","Hamzah, as I said in my comments, we're not going to spend time on the call today talking about the restructure. We've done our work. We had a lot of discussion about it internally with external advisers. We even talked about it with our board. We have concluded, as I said in my comments, that it doesn't pass the test in our mind, and it doesn't fit our business. So let's move past it.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just maybe a follow-up, along the same lines if you could share any work you've done on the MLP structure and what your views are there?","Donald W. Slager","My answer is the same.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. Maybe I'll ask a question on the business then. Maybe if you could talk about -- do you think we are past the pricing pressures that we've seen in this business over the last few years? Pricing has come off each year since we came out of the downturn. Are we past the pricing trough, in your mind? Or do we have -- or is 2014 sort of the recovery year for you guys? And we still see sort of price relief going on in some parts of your business this year?","Donald W. Slager","Well, I think I would categorize it as saying we're coming out of the trough. We are probably about halfway through our Commercial -- or I'm sorry, our Residential Municipal business. As you know, those contracts are, call it, 5 years on average in duration. We've been taking some price rollbacks to extend those business -- those business contracts over the last several years. We're probably halfway, maybe a little better than halfway through that. We're going to continue to see some price pressure there as the municipalities have their own pressures related to their tax base, et cetera. So we baked that into our guidance for this year. We expect to have some continued pressure. As it relates to the open market, we think -- we think, as we probably said many times, we think, generally, larger companies tend to be rational, and we think sometimes the very small companies tend to be less rational. The best thing for pricing in that situation is going to be some organic growth, as organic volume returns to the sector, we think the open market pricing improves and that's just the nature of open competition. I think that will give us a little bit of a tailwind. The other thing that we face, of course, is half our business is indexed, to CPI and we've seen a little bit of up and down here in CPI. But we're still kind of holding up better than we did a couple of years ago, where we had CPI in the flat, negative and 1% range. So again, I'd characterize that as sort of the past. And coming out of the trough, we've got a couple of quarters of plus 1% core price in -- ending '12, and so our exit speed in '12 is good and we'll continue to be diligent in the way we price our business. So we're feeling pretty good about it and I think that's recognizing our guidance of 1% to 1.5% price.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Can I ask a follow up question, since you didn't answer the first 2 tax questions. How should investors...","Donald W. Slager","[indiscernible] question?","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I said, can I ask a follow-up on the business? Maybe if you could frame for us when you think we'll see the benefits of a housing recovery in your numbers and what the lag there is? Any sort of derivative impacts of a housing recovery, like new business formation, et cetera?","Donald W. Slager","Well it's raised the housing construction. I would tell you that we're probably, at least -- we're probably 12 months to follow. So again late cycle. We've got to see these housing starts turn into finished houses and again, that's where the waste is generated and then when you see business formation around that. So we're hopeful the way you are, but we're also cautious and we don't want to be the guys out there trying to predict the economy. It hasn't worked for us too much in the past. So we're going to -- again, base our guidance, as we have, on what we know about the economy today and as it improves, we're going to be talking to you about it every 90 days and giving you guys updates on what we're experiencing and seeing. And like you, hoping for the best, as it relates to that and that would be upside for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Hoffman, with Wunderlich.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Glenn, welcome aboard, by the way.","Glenn A. Culpepper","Thank you.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Can we talk a little bit about return on invested capital and your annual incentive compensation plan as we go into '13? As a group and individually, the companies have been fighting sort of a negative slope on the line of ROIC for all the reasons that have been talked about ad nauseum today and previously. But the trends are shifting and based on your dataset it feels like you should reverse that trend in the ROIC in '13 and could you talk about your annual incentive comp plan, how it drives some of the behavior to assure that happens?","Edward A. Lang","Michael, #1, there's been no change in our incentive compensation systems. We have 2 programs for management, one is an annual plan and the other one is a 3-year rolling plan, we call it a long term incentive plan, or an LTIP. The ROIC calculation really comes into the rolling 3-year LTIP plan. And essentially, there are 2 metrics in the plan. One metric is return on invested capital and the second is, we term, as cash value creation. So essentially, it's a balanced approach where we look at -- you get the maximum or higher payouts when you show gradual improvement on return on invested capital over time. And also free cash flow growth. But what we want to recognize in the compensation system, it's not just one-sided. Meaning, we don't want to shrink the greatness just to grow the ROIC. We also want to grow the free cash flow in the business. So although we'll have very firm hurdle rates, based on our weighted average cost of capital and associated premiums for business risk, we want to grow the free cash flow, we want to grow the revenue and we're also looking to return, or improve our return on invested capital. So essentially, it's a balanced approach over time in order for management to maximize their pay out.","Donald W. Slager","So, Michael, we think we have all the right triggers, as Ed said, cash flow, EPS, ROI and cash value creation, all the way down to the local manager. They have upping targets and they have pricing plans built-in to their plans and they also get charged for CapEx. Right, so there is no free CapEx at Republic Services. So we're hyper-focused on cash and as you said, the #1 thing we've faced over the last couple of years, putting pressure on ROI, has been price compression. And the #1 thing that's going to drive that forward is going to be some organic growth that's going to change that. It's going to impact CPI, it's going to impact sort of a small competitive behavior and a little bit of new volume growth will sort of come in at a higher margin than average. All of those things will help move that ROI forward and as it relates to price, we've got 3 strong controls in place internally, so that we don't have people out there pricing our post-collection assets in a way that is in conflict with our growth plans for the marketplace. So we think we've got the right controls and processes in place to keep pricing moving in an intelligent direction.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then change of direction, slightly. Are you starting to see in your collection operations in the market, new business formation? The empty storefront in the strip mall or it's the new Dunkin' Donuts being opened. Is that -- how would you characterize what's happening in the marketplace?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. I would say it's not quite a headline yet. But as I said, to answer some of these questions -- some of these questions earlier, we -- generally, I speak for the whole management team, we feel better about the business as we exited '12 than we did a year ago. We feel better about some of the growth potential  out there that we're seeing and some of the anecdotal things that we're seeing than we did a year ago. So I think -- somebody mentioned, I think it was Hamzah who mentioned, where are you at the trough? I think we're coming out of the trough. But again, this business doesn't change very quickly. You probably heard my predecessor say that 1,000 times in the time that you knew him. So it's true in this business, but it's directionally good and we think this guidance is, again, a good step forward for the company, it creates net of some of the adjustments, good high-single digit cash flow growth and EPS growth and as the organic growth comes back and we have continued success in executing all of our plans and our productivity measures, we're reporting quarter-by-quarter and again, hopefully, we'll see some of that growth everybody wants to see.","Operator","The next question comes from Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.","Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Can you give us an update on your National Accounts business? And on a related note, I appreciate your earlier commentary on your pace of investment in recycling capacity. But do you feel that this pace is sufficient enough to remain competitive in winning new national accounts? How important is this to your future growth plans?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. So we have 240 markets that our business is divided into, 40 states. But 240 marketplaces. We have coverage across those marketplaces either through handle recycling for our national accounts, either through company-owned facilities, or through partnerships with a third-party networks. So we have -- in markets where we don't have our own capacity, we have contracted with other third parties to handle our recycling processing, et cetera. So we've got about 80 or so percent coverage across those markets, which we think is substantial and sufficient, quite frankly, to provide the services needed and requested by our national account clients. So we are growing our National Accounts business. We have even recently unveiled some very new programs for some of our existing National Accounts who wants to see more recycling and diversion. So we're very active in that space and we'll continue to do that. So we don't think we're deficient and as I said, we'll continue to be very steady in our approach in investing in the business. So we're going to spend about 10% of our revenues every year in CapEx. It takes a certain amount of money to replace the fleet every year,  to replace containers that rust out, to replace airspace in our landfills that is consumed and then we have enough left over to do 3 to 5 markets a year, as it relates to building our recycling capability. We think that pace is sufficient based on my earlier comment of the coverage we have with our third-party network and alliances. So we'll continue on the march in a slow and steady pace, slow and steady wins the race. The tortoise is never boastful, but the tortoise perseveres. So that's our view on life here at Republic Services.","Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I know in the past you've been able to give us how much revenues that business represents for you. Could you give that to us again?","Edward A. Lang","Recycling probably represents about 9% or 10% of our total revenue.","Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","No, no, no, for your National Accounts business, how much of that...","Edward A. Lang","National Accounts, well, we've not made disclosures specifically about National Accounts as a percentage of total revenue.","Operator","The next question comes from Stewart Scharf, with S&P Capital IQ.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research","Could you talk a little bit about -- you mentioned you're stewards of the climate and a little more about your renewables and environmental initiatives, what you're planning to do with that. And also regarding landfills, your landfill life is -- averages roughly 60-plus years and I was wondering with all recycling increasing, is that looking to -- like it will extend further, or stay pretty much close to that target?","Donald W. Slager","Okay, Stewart. So you've probably heard us talk before about something we call the evolving ton, which kind of describes the fact that we think that total waste stream in America is changing. And frankly, growing. Per capita, I think people are throwing out, maybe a little less trash year-over-year, but the population continues to grow. And so in total, the waste stream grows year-on-year. Our business grows with population growth, as the tonnage increases household formation and the like. So today, we have a substantial recycling business, albeit, it's a small percentage of the whole. We continue to build out our recycling capabilities, as I just talked about with the last question. And we haven't seen, again, a substantial shift year-on-year of waste coming out of the landfill into -- into our recycling plants, but it is a steady pace of change. We believe more and more of the growth in the waste stream will come from recycling and diverted materials. So we've got a great asset base in our landfills. We may not fill some of the air space today, but we'll fill it up over time. And so we've described before that these landfills are not like airline seats. The volume -- just because you don't fill the seat today, you haven't lost the opportunity. That landfill airspace will become more valuable over time. So we continue to invest in recycling in the markets that want it and when customers demand it and are willing to pay for it. And it makes sense economically and with a great return. So we're very focused on that. We're focused on being good stewards of the planet with our engineering group and running our facilities well. We continue to build out our CNG fleet of -- roughly half of our CNG -- roughly half of our truck buy this year, again, a little bit less than half this year will be CNG fuel. So we're continuing to take advantage of, 1, the cost savings, but also the fact that it's a very clean alternative for fuel source. So again, a steady pace of change, continually rolling out these initiatives and taking -- making a little bit of progress every year toward our ultimate goal.","Operator","Thank you.

There will be a question and answer session following Republic summary of quarterly earnings. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. DelGhiaccio. Good afternoon, Mr. DelGhiaccio.","Brian DelGhiaccio","Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. This is Brian DelGhiaccio. And I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services' fourth quarter 2014 conference call. Don Slager, our CEO, and Chuck Serianni, our CFO, are joining me as we discuss our performance.","Before we get started, I would like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information we discuss on today's call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties and may be materially different from our actual results. Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.","The material that we discuss today is time-sensitive.

When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website, along with instructions for listening to the live webcast of the event.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.","Don Slager","Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which were in line with our expectations. The Republic team continues to execute on our long-term strategy, designed to generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, while continually improving return on invested capital.","Some of our financial highlights for the quarter in full year include, fourth quarter adjusted EPS, was $0.50. This result includes a $0.02 benefit from the extension of CNG fuel tax credits. Full year adjusted EPS was a $1.96 and adjusted free cash flow was $709 million. Both performance metrics were in line with the full year guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.","Core price in the fourth quarter was 3.2%, and average yield was 1.7%. This is our highest level of average yield in the last four years. Fourth quarter volumes increased to 1.6%, volume growth continues to be concentrated to construction and demolition waste. We returned approximately $780 million total cash to shareholders during the year, which represents a cash yield of 6%.","This includes 11 million shares repurchased for $400 million. We finished the year with total shareholder return of 24.7%, the highest level in the solid waste industry and well above the SNP 500 average.","Throughout 2014, we discussed our multi-year initiatives that enabled us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably grow our business, enhance the customer experience, improve productivity, and reduce cost.","I will now recap our progress made during the year. 14% of our fleet is operating on natural gas. During 2014 we added seven CNG fuelling stations, and now operate a total of 36. We increased the automated portion of our residential fleet to 69%, from 66% in the prior year. During 2014, we certified 14% of the fleet under our One Fleet maintenance program.","Approximately 60% of our fleet has been certified since inception. Some of the benefits we are seeing in our One Fleet divisions include, 1% to 2% lower maintenance cost per engine hour, 2% greater fleet reliability, 20% fewer unscheduled repairs, and 50% lower technician turnover.","We continue to make investments in recycling facilities to improve productivity, and increase capabilities while rationalizing underperforming assets. We closed seven older recycling facilities that were not earning an adequate return during 2014.","We invested $231 million to acquire 132 million of solid waste revenue, at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 5.6 times. This includes the acquisition of Rainbow Disposal, a high quality franchise business that complements our Southern California operations.","Additionally, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tervita, LLC for approximately $485 million. The acquisition of Tervita provides a platform to expand our presence in the US, ENP waste sector, and unites an experienced high quality workforce with the Republic team.","We believe the ENP waste sector provides attractive long-term growth opportunities, and leverages our expertise in waste handling recovery in disposal. The assets are well-positioned with approximately 80% of the revenue generated in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Permian basins, we expect the deal to close this month.","During 2014, we entered or we heightened our focus on our customers to differentiate our service offering, build customer loyalty, and increase willingness to pay. For example, we launched the My Resource customer portal, which gives our customers online access to their accounts and our services. Over 500,000 customers have enrolled to date.","We\u2019ve launched the My Resource mobile app, an expansion of our customer\u2019s online management tool. The app allows customers to schedule services and receive push notifications using a mobile device. We implemented the tablet-based Capture pricing tool, which creates a more professional sales experience, and helps realize better pricing levels at the point of sale. This rollout is complete in 17 of our 20 areas.","And we launched priority based selling, or PBS, which enables us to identify end segment customers buying priorities, and attract customers that are willing to pay for enhanced offerings. We expect that PBS will be fully implemented by the end of 2015. I\u2019m proud of our many achievements during 2014, which are reflected in our strong performance. Before turning the call over to Chuck, I want to provide an update on the residential business.","Last quarter we discussed the actions we are taking to improve performance. Since then we have engaged many of our municipal customers and made good progress. Most of our municipal partners were on a pricing mechanism that is fair to both parties, and understand low CPA space resets, and that kept pace with cost increases over the last six years.","We had continued to educate municipalities and expanded the use of industries published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, than more closely aligned with our structure. These include the water and sewer and trash collection services index, and the garbage and trash collection index.","We are very early in the process, but remain encouraged by our initial results. The remainder of our business continues to perform well, and is generating strong year-over-year increases in revenue and EBITDA.","Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial results, Chuck?","Chuck Serianni","Thank you Don. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.50, which excluded Bridgeton related mediation - remediation charges of $0.32, and divestiture related cost of $0.04. During the fourth quarter we recorded a charge of $191 million, primarily related to the Bridgeton landfill. The charge primarily relates to additional cost to operate, maintain, and replace equipment to the end of the post closure period.","We were able to make better assessment of future costs now that the Leachate management facility is operational. And operating costs stabilized on equipment that was upgraded in prior quarters. The charges accrued upfront, because this is a closed site, but the cash will be spent over the next 35 years. Fourth quarter 2014 revenue was approximately $2.2 billion, an increase of $84 million over the prior year. This 3.9% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.6%, and acquisitions of 1.3%.","The components of internal growth are, average yield growth of 1.7%. Average yield in the collection business was 1.9%, which includes 2.9% yield in the industrial business, 2.1% yield in the commercial business, and 90 basis points in the residential business. Average yield in the post collection business was 1.1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.6%.","Core price, which measures price increases, net of rollbacks to our same store customer base was 3.2%. Core price consisted of 4.3% in the open market, and 1.5% in the restricted portion of our business. Our volumes increased 1.6% year-over-year. The collection business was positive in 1.8%, primarily due to an increase in industrial volume.","Growth in the large container industrial business was 4.8%, and includes C&D and other temporary business, which was up 6%. Volume in the small container commercial business was up 1.2%, and residential volume was relatively flat. The post-collection business was up 60 basis points and included landfill growth of 1.4%, partially offset by decline in transfer station volumes of 1.3%.","Within landfill, MSW was up 2.1%, C&D increased 5.5%, and special waste grew 50 basis points. We expected special waste growth to moderate in the fourth quarter, due to a tough comparison in the prior year. Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 20 basis points. Most of the change related to decline in the cost of fuel.","Fuel cost decreased approximately $22 million compared to the prior year, which includes a CNG tax credit of $10 million. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $3.58 in the fourth quarter, from $3.87 in the prior year, a decrease of 7.5%. The current average diesel price is $2.83 per gallon.","During 2014, we increased the amount of fuel we recover through our fuel recovery fee program. Currently we recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs, additionally 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged, using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel, results in a $1 million change in operating income.","Since diesel cost decreased significantly over the last two months, we expect to realize a $0.02 EPS benefit in the first quarter of 2015. This relates to the timing of our fuel recovery fee adjustment, which tends to lag the change in fuel expense by one to two months.","We assume diesel prices remain at the current price of $2.83 per gallon in our 2015 EPS in free cash flow guidance. We expect a favorable impact to EBITDA margins in 2015, since both revenue and cost will decline by a relatively equal amount.","Finally, commodity revenue decreased 50 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales reflects a decrease in tons sold and the decline in recycle commodity prices. Commodity prices decreased 2.5%, to an average price of $113 per ton in the fourth quarter, from a $116 per ton in the prior year.","Fourth quarter recycling volume of 568,000 tons, was down approximately 5% from the prior year. Most of the decrease relates to underperforming facilities we closed during the year. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $4 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue.","Current average commodity prices are approximately $95 per ton, this is down approximately $20 per ton from October prices, which we used to provide our preliminary outlook. This results in a $0.06 headwind to 2015 EPS if prices remain at current levels.","We are taking actions to raise prices for recycling collection services, and adjusting rate rebates to our open market customers in response to lower commodity prices. We know our customers value, the high quality recycling services that we provide and we must earn an appropriate return to deliver those services.","Before I move on, I\u2019d like to summarize the impact in changing fuel and commodity prices on our 2015 guidance, and reconcile the difference to the preliminary outlook we provided last October.","The impact of lower net fuel and lower recycling commodity prices, results in a $0.04 EPS headwind consisting of a decrease of $0.06 due to lower commodity prices, and an increase of $0.02 due to the timing difference of our fuel recovery fee program.","Accordingly, the lower end of our 2015 EPS guidance is $0.04 lower than our preliminary outlook. This assumes recycled commodity prices remain at current levels. The high-end of our 2015 EPS guidance is only $0.02 lower than our preliminary outlook. The high-end considers the impact if commodity prices return back to $115 per ton beginning in the second quarter. Excluding fuel and commodity, our 2015 EPS and free cash flow guidance is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided.","Now I will discuss changes in margins. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.1% compared to 30.3% in the prior year, a decrease of 220 basis points. Most of the change relates to favorable items in the prior year, which included 160 basis points from one time environmental and risk insurance savings. The remaining 60 basis points change primarily relates to an increase in legal accruals of 50 basis points, and the timing of incentive compensation accruals of 50 basis points. And these are partially offset by a benefit from CNG tax credits of 40 basis points.","On a full year basis our EBITDA margin was 28.1%. I\u2019d like to point out a couple of line items. Maintenance cost increased 20 basis points, compared to the prior year. Most of the change relates to increased vehicle complexity and cost to refurbished vehicles and containers to support volume growth. We continue to see higher cost to maintain newer engines, due to enhanced emissions controls.","SG&A costs were 10.3% of revenue, an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Most of the change relates to an increase in incentive compensation expense and an adjustment to bad debt expense in the prior year.","I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of our cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Brian will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data. Brian?","Brian DelGhiaccio","Thanks Chuck. Fourth quarter 2014 interest expense was $88 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 38.4% of adjusted earnings for both the fourth quarter and full year. In 2015 we expect to return to our statutory effective tax rate of approximately 39.5%. The increase in tax rate together with the exploration of CNG tax credits results in a $0.06 EPS headwind in 2015.","Full year adjusted free cash flow was $709 million. This performance includes a cash tax benefit from the extension of bonus depreciation of approximately $45 million, partially offset by a capital pull forward of $25 million.","At December 31st our accounts receivable balance was $930 million, and day sales outstanding was 38 days or 26 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately 7.1 billion at December 31st, and availability under our bank facility was approximately 1.6 billion.","I will now turn the call back to Don.","Don Slager","Thanks Brian. Before I open up the call for questions, I will provide our 2015 financial guidance. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.98 to $2.04. This performance represents mid to high single-digit earnings growth after excluding the $0.06 headwind from tax related items, and $0.04 headwind from net fuel and commodity. We anticipate adjusted free cash flow to be in a range of $710 million to $740 million.","This performance represents mid to high single-digit growth after excluding the cash tax impact from the exploration of bonus depreciations and impact from net fuel and commodity. We expect annual revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, which includes average yield of approximately 1.5%, volume growth of 1.5% to 2%, contribution from acquisitions of 1.5%, a decline in fuel recovery fees of 1%, and a reduction in recycled commodity revenue of 50 to 100 basis points.","We anticipate EBITDA margin of 28% to 28.5%, our 2015 EBITDA margin guidance is consistent with our slightly up versus, or slightly up versus our 2014 performance. Most of the expected improvement relates to the impact of lower net fuel.","2015 net capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $855 million, this level of spending includes a $40 million benefit from cost effectively extending the useful life of our fleet, offset by growth capital of 35 million, infrastructure development of 15 million and investments in technology of 10 million.","Our 2015 guidance does not include the pending acquisitions of Tervita LLC, which we anticipate will close this month. We expect to maintain our 2015 full year EPS and free cash flow guidance after the deal closes since integration cost and infrastructure development expenditures are projected to offset the contribution from the acquisition in the first year. This is consistent with the expectation we provided when we announced the deal in December.","Well onto our business fundamentals and strength of our assets has not change. We will continue to manage the business to create long-term shareholder value in 2015, we will remain focused on executing our strategy which is designed to profitably grow our business through organic growth opportunities and acquisitions, gain pricing power through differentiation and superior service delivery, improve productivity and reduce cost through our fleet faced initiatives.","Generate consistent earnings and cash flow growth, and continually improve return on invested capital. And increase cash returns to shareholders while maintaining a strong capital structure. We look forward to delivering on our promises to key stake holders including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders.","For our customers we strive to provide the highest level of customer service. We are committed to developing differentiated and superior products that enhance the customer experience.","For the communities we serve, we are the go to resource for delivering safe, environmentally friendly and innovative solutions that make communities better. For our employees, training and developing our people is a priority. We strive to be the employer of choice.","And for our shareholders, we remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and free cash flow growth, improving return on investment capital and increasing cash returns.","I would like to thank the entire Republic team for the contributions that have allowed us to meet our 2014 objectives, and positioned us well for future growth opportunities.","At this time operator I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joe Box","So 1.5% to 2% volume growth, that looks pretty good for 2015. Can you maybe just walk us through by activity or at least directionally give us a sense of where you see that coming from?","Don Slager","Sure, well again, the bright spot in volume for 2014 has been concentrated to construction and demolition. So we think those trends will continue through 2015. We did start to see, at the end of 2014, a little bit of MSW volume activity pickup in our landfills. We haven\u2019t yet really seen much activity of real growth in our commercial business. We don\u2019t have much of that baked in really in \u201915, but that\u2019s maybe where the upside lies, if we can start to see some of the broader economic recovery start to impact our commercial business. It\u2019s directionally good, but we haven\u2019t seen the uptick that we\u2019d hoped so far, but somewhere out there on the horizon for us.","Chuck Serianni","And one of the ways to look at it too Joe is, if you kind of look at our full year performance this year from a volume perspective, it was 2%. So next year being 1.5 to 2, really kind of a continuation of what we saw on \u201814 with the exception, when you kind of take a look at special waste, special waste was pretty strong this year, really coming off of a really low comp from the prior year. So again, that would probably be the one difference, it\u2019s expressed as far as the rate of growth, rather than that relatively consistent with \u201814.","Joe Box","I appreciate that, and I guess I thought that Don you would have mentioned maybe the commercial business is a little bit stronger. And I think you mentioned last quarter it was up 1.8%, this quarter it was only up 1.2%. I guess I\u2019m a little surprised to not see that sequentially ramp. Is there something out there, whether it\u2019s pricing or just markets that it could be holding that back?","Don Slager","Yeah Joe, I\u2019m sure you got the 1.8, I\u2019m looking at Q3 of \u201814 was 1.1 in volume growth. So we picked up a little bit in Q4. Yield in commercial was 1.8 right in commercial Q4 sort of Q3. So it\u2019s again its trending well. Again, part of this is - our focus is in improving yield, right? And improving the quality of the sale and reducing churn and those things, so we're really focused there, but we think the continued volume in commercial will look consistent with what it is and wouldn\u2019t spend. And that again, if we see broader improvement, then we\u2019ll be the first to talk to you about it.","Chuck Serianni","Yeah Joe just to give an idea, the commercial volume has been ranged down between 1.1 and 1.3 for the last five quarters, with an average of 1.2% for the full year.","Joe Box","One last one and I\u2019ll turn it over. Do you guys think that this complete fall off in recycling prices could potentially be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back here? I guess what I\u2019m trying to understand is, if this could actually be a positive, it might be the impetus to structurally improving this business. I know you guys have closed a couple of facilities but do you think that this might cause a broader base industry rationalization, or just the opportunity to go back to clients and break a restructure contract?","Don Slager","Well it is I would tell you, first of all, this is being impacted by really broad global macro issues right, so you\u2019ve got this issue reports compounding that, but you\u2019ve got supply and demand issues are global. You\u2019ve got China economy, you\u2019ve got all that going on. We\u2019ve not seen a precipitous fall like this in quite some time. Over the long term we think it probably comes back.","Keep in mind that recycling is a core offering for us, it\u2019s something that, it\u2019s a product our service that our customers want to buy. I think they value it more, probably then sometimes the industry thinks it does or they do. So we're going to look at opportunities, certainly to price our commodities in our recycling services in the open market. As you can imagine, we've already adjusted our tipping rates at our facilities in the open market.","We've got a number of really long-term contracts with large municipalities that we're bound to deliver on through the remainder of the term, we\u2019ll do that. We will continually look to your point Joe, for ways to structure things better, but just generally municipalities are not built to accept the risk of commodities, commodity market, so we've got to figure out a better way to do that.","Operator","The next question comes from Al Kaschalk from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Al Kaschalk","I just want to press further on C&D waste. Don could you just maybe share, given your footprint, is this broad-based? And are we still climbing along with retail occupancy rates or starts on housing in terms of this activity?","Don Slager","Yeah, so it is broad-based and we're seeing this growth year-over-year and consistent quarterly growth across the entire company. We now, we've seen volume growth, we've seen pricing growth right? So temporary pricing is up, almost frankly as much as the volume is up. So we are growing units across all of our geographic areas and we're growing price per unit as well. So the demand is there, we've put a lot of our equipment back to work.","Chuck made the point that we spent a lot of maintenance expense this year, giving us more - put back from service. So we think it\u2019s going to continue. And remember, I mean your household formation still not at the 50 year average. So we think over time, it could get back to that but I think we\u2019ve got a pretty solid plan for \u201815 and that we\u2019ll see this sort of continued volume as we saw in \u201814 in C&D.","And of course we've seen at the landfills too, which again very, very broad-based. So I think I\u2019ve touched before, we don\u2019t really track our halls between residential and commercial, it\u2019s not that meaningful to us. We track more between sort of permanent and temporary, that\u2019s what the meaningful statistic is in our business.","Al Kaschalk","And the point being there is that the temporary number has been strong, but it\u2019s also been better than price?","Don Slager","Yeah absolutely right, so when you think about almost 5% price per unit through all basis across the business, that\u2019s pretty strong.","Chuck Serianni","Again we would expect that, and we've been talking about this for a year. This is what we would expect right as volume demands come back, we would be able to get our fair share of the growth naturally because our footprint is so strong. And that we\u2019d be able to price for accordingly and that\u2019s what we've done.","Chuck Serianni","Yeah in the Temp business in the fourth quarter the halls were up 5.6% and the pricing was up 4.8%. So you are getting double-digit organic growth in that portion of the business.","Al Kaschalk","The other question I had and sort of two-part, but given what\u2019s happening with diesel prices or transportation costs etcetera. Two things, one, do you expect or have you started to see any benefit in the residential side of the business maybe production on consumption, and then therefore waste generation? And then secondly, can you speak to the dynamic that may occur as a result of lower diesel prices by private companies or competitors in the market that theoretically should get more aggressive on price. Is that out there as a concern, how would you respond to that?","Don Slager","Okay, so first of all right, you know that our fuel, we basically have a natural held hedge built up into our operating model with our fuel recovery fee and then our fuel hedges. So you\u2019re structural through his remarks, we're not going to see much of a benefit for dropping fuel prices. So that\u2019s that, as far as consumption goes, well the average consumer because of spending less on fuel, spend more in the economy.","I think maybe over the long-term, I think I saw some stature today that said that people are pulling back a little bit because they\u2019re not sure that this low fuel environment is going to last very long. But it lasted long enough and it looks like a structural shift then maybe people will start pulling some of their, the cash back to work in the economy, that would certainly be good for us in the small container and landfill business.","So we\u2019ll see what happens with that. As far as what it does competitively, certainly the small companies that don\u2019t have fuel recovery fee, that don\u2019t have this path through mechanism. They are experiencing, today, sort of an immediate improvement in their operating expenses. If they\u2019re really smart, they\u2019ll hang onto that and realize that this fuel environment may not stay over for very long.","And they won\u2019t just get it back in their pricing. That would be the smart way to look at it. If, at the same time, our customers are experiencing price benefit from us because we have this fair first mechanism that as fuel goes up, we share the risk, and as fuel goes down we share the benefit. And so our customers are seeing some pricing relief on their bills which I think positioned us pretty well with the customer as a contract as a part of that\u2019s being fair. So we have not heard of any irrational competitive behavior because of fuel issues at this point.","I don\u2019t know that, I expected - it\u2019s not keeping me up at night Al. I think overall with dropping fuel prices, our customers probably feel pretty good. We\u2019re doing a good job for them and we\u2019ll continue to adjust their pricing as necessary with other inflation.","Operator","The next question comes from Adam Baumgarten of Macquarie, your line is open.","Adam Baumgarten","Just a question, how should we think about the capacity for additional acquisitions and share purchase, given that\u2019s your way to deal?","Don Slager","Well we gave guidance that we were thinking about $100 million of spend again this year, in and around tuck-ins in the core space. There may be some opportunity to spend some acquisition of dollars in and around the ENP space over time. But basically you can figure that we\u2019ll spend another 360 million this year on share repurchase right, 100 million on tuck-ins. We\u2019ve certainly got the debt capacity to do that, of course we\u2019re going to pay dividend again, and we consistently raise the dividends through time.","So our same balanced approach the cash utilization is part of our strategy for a long time, it\u2019s part of the value that we create for our owners, that really hasn\u2019t changed. The degree of acquisition is somewhat limited by the pipeline, we\u2019re willing to do quality deals. We\u2019re not going to buy companies that haven\u2019t been around for a long time with good assets. So that\u2019s - that focus hasn\u2019t changed. The 360 Adam is actually the amount remaining on our authorization, so we intend to complete that in 2015.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel, your line is open.","Michael Hoffman","I hope I\u2019m going to be able to get this question out correctly. So I\u2019m trying to reconcile the cash flow from guidance at the beginning of \u201914, what you did and where bonus - because you didn\u2019t think there was going to be any bonus depreciation when you gave us guidance last year at this time. And at the end of the year we have it. But I\u2019m trying to understand, what\u2019s the delta between the 709 and the original guidance? Is it $20 million, and so X bonus depreciation you came in at 689, that\u2019s still within your range, it was a god number, and bonus depreciation helped by $20 million?","Chuck Serianni","Michael you\u2019re right. This is Chuck. You\u2019re right on with that. But let me just walk through that just in case others on the call don\u2019t follow it. So free cash flow, we reported 709 for the year, you\u2019ve got a benefit from bonus depreciation of $45 million. And then we\u2019ve got a $25 million offset to that, because we pulled forward our capital to the year, which gives us to 689 on an adjusted basis. And that falls actually on a high-end of the range in our guidance that we gave in October, of 675 to 690.","Michael Hoffman","That\u2019s cool. And then what is - is there any bonus depreciation in the 1555 to 1585 cash flow from aps?","Chuck Serianni","No, no, actually Michael, it reverses in \u201815, so when we think about free cash flow for 2015, you actually had a negative because the bonus depreciation of $25 million. And that\u2019s offset by the $25 million of pull forward capital that we have, the capital that we pulled forward into 2014. So that ends up being a neutral on 2015.","Michael Hoffman","Special waste trends, I get you had a tough comp in the fourth quarter, but are you starting to see special waste coming from non-residential sort of type activity that could suggest that - well it might not be in your guidance. And 1.5 to 2 seems like a good number for volume, to me, but if non-res construction starts showing up, maybe that number gets stronger, and a leading indicator would be special waste?","Chuck Serianni","Yeah, special waste has been strong for us. You\u2019re right, we\u2019re seeing a little bit more of that activity, it\u2019s probably too early to call it, but you\u2019re exactly right. When we see more and more of the kind of lane clearing jobs that are precursor to industrial and commercial development, it\u2019ll bode well for that part of the business, but also construction volumes at large.","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Redding of BB&T, your line is open.","Charles Redding","Where do you peg the current differential right now between CNG and diesel? I guess has this dislocation impacted any kind of plans for CNG fleets then?","Don Slager","I would say the difference between the two is probably about $1 right now. And that doesn\u2019t have an impact on our long-term plans. We still think that the movement into CNG makes sense, so we\u2019re going to continue that initiative.","Chuck Serianni","This year, the CNG trucks that we\u2019re purchasing will be delivered into facilities where we\u2019ve already got the infrastructure, where we\u2019ve already set up the fuelling stations. As you know, that\u2019s a big part of the investment when we convert fleets over. So, we won\u2019t be putting in as many new CNG filling stations as we have over the last couple of years. We\u2019ll just continue to bring density to the fleets where we already have the investments made.","Charles Redding","And then maybe you could just speak a little more to overall trends on the residential side. What are you seeing here, and are you seeing any, I guess, projected pullback and spending class, or perhaps any regions that are stronger than others, at least with respect to residential?","Don Slager","No, I guess the most exciting trend that we have going on in the residential, is that we\u2019ve been converting some of our residential customers to the new waste index or industries. And so we\u2019ve got, of our total revenue, call it $700 million to $900 million of residential business that\u2019s not typical five year contract. So these might be anything from a nature way to a - call it a large city, but a typical five year contract in that business. And so $700 million to $900 million of total angle revenue. We\u2019ve already converted about 70 million of that revenue to one of the new industries.","So giving the mark of CPI and it\u2019s going to take some time to work through the remainder as contracts come due. But we\u2019ve been at that now for a couple of quarters, making pretty good progress. So the people we\u2019ve been talking to so far have been pretty open to that idea. We have been successful everywhere of course, but we\u2019re going to continue to move down that road. That\u2019s probably the most compelling thing that\u2019s going on for us, residential, where most of our focus lies right now.","Operator","The next question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James, your line is open.","Tyler Brown","So Chuck, thanks for the help on the recycling expectation. So can you give us a little bit of color on your composition of your recycle basket? Maybe by type, say fiber, glass, plastics, etcetera, etcetera?","Chuck Serianni","Well, fiber makes up about 70% of our overall recycling, the rest of it is made up of, as you mentioned, glass. And various plastics and aluminum molds for another metals.","Tyler Brown","Is, plastics bigger in that mix?","Chuck Serianni","It\u2019s probably about 5% or so, of the mix.","Tyler Brown","And then Don, I\u2019m kind of curious, can you give us a little bit more color on Capture? I think you said 17 of 20 areas, I assume that\u2019s the preponderance of your sales people. Is that a good way to look at it?","Don Slager","Yeah, that\u2019s right. We\u2019ll get the other three areas completed here pretty soon, but we just need to get it done by the end of the year.","Tyler Brown","So, bigger question. Where does that really attack in average yield? Is that designed to go after gross price, is it about reducing rollbacks, or is it about narrowing the loss to gain spread, or is it kind of all of the above?","Don Slager","Yeah, so when you think about churn, think primarily of the business loss versus business gained. So again, we review and adjust pricing on every customer throughout the year, in what we call our RPM process, so 12 monthly buckets basically. Ever customer gets reviewed because we have cost inflation, even net of our productivity gains and everything else we do to improve the business. We saw cost inflation, we better recover that. So everyone gets adjusted, there\u2019s some negotiation, there\u2019s some rollbacks, there may even be some losses of customers.","Some of those are due to pricing, some of those are due to just competitive behavior. Every once in a while we make a mistake and don\u2019t give the service that we need to give, and customer will leave for that reason, fewer and fewer of those let\u2019s say. But as we\u2019re replacing those customers that we lose, and remember, we\u2019ve got about a 7% defection rate in our business, every year 7% of customers leave us for some reason. We replace those customers.","Well the Capture tool is designed really at the heart of that. So as our sales reps are out in the marketplace calling our new accounts, are these maybe new from competition, there may be new, brand new businesses springing out of the ground. We want to make sure at the point of sale, for those new accounts, that we've got better controls in place to get the very best pricing in that situation. So Capture allows our sales people want to be more efficient, they cover more ground.","They can see more customers, two when they get in front of the customer, they can do a better job of understanding and segmenting that customer, understanding their needs, that gets tied right into the PBS selling initiative we call [indiscernible] [00:43] selling. So between the PBS training and the Capture tool, we think our sales people now are better equipped to go in and get better pricing on those new customers, by doing a better job of understanding what\u2019s important to them, and what they are willing to pay for.","That also again, it makes it more efficient and makes the sale, it makes actually the experience better for customers, because it\u2019s a tablet-based tool, we can show the customer their sample invoice. And we can get a customer signature on the tablet for their electronic service agreement. The whole process just gets tighter and better. And we've got better control, so it\u2019s a cloud-based software. So if we want to raise prices in Denver tomorrow, tonight we can make price adjustments to the actual price sheets that the sales people use.","And tomorrow they could be selling at higher prices with very stringent guard rails and limits on their authority and what decisions they can make in front of the customer, so that was a mouthful, but does that help you Tyler?","Tyler Brown","No that\u2019s great color. So I mean as of to date, are you seeing any reduction in churn and or the gap between loss to new business narrow?","Don Slager","Yeah, so we look at average selling price of new customers, it\u2019s kind of on the per unit basis, is one of the ways we do that. You think about average yield in our, average yield at our commercial business in Q3 was 1.8% and Q4 was 2.1%. This is largely focused on the open market commercial and open market industrial business. It\u2019s not necessarily that municipal business, it\u2019s not the residential subscription business. It\u2019s those two big open market verticals for us, and we're seeing improvement.","We're getting great feedback from the field, great feedback from the sales team, makes their jobs a little easier. And so it\u2019s the right thing to do, we're excited about it. We're going to rollout these next couple of areas, and then continue to move forward from here.","Tyler Brown","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then if I can squeeze one maybe last one in. So clearly residential has been a big drag just given CPI. And you noted some great success on the new industries, some great data actually that you gave. But how should we think about this business longer term. I mean to me it\u2019s probably one of your lower ROIC businesses. Would you look to retrench if you really don\u2019t have any pickup in CPI and or success on the new industries?","Don Slager","Well we're having success, again, we're not going, I wouldn\u2019t advise you to extrapolate that success easily, it\u2019s very difficult work. The business we have - has an ROI that\u2019s above our whack, I mean so its returning positively, it just has fallen off from where we've come from. And so look, we went through a really tough recession, these municipalities faced with these municipal pensions that we\u2019re failing, faced with the tax basis crumbling, property taxes and all the rest of it.","Economy has been battling back, you see all those metrics in the economy, we've been good Republic private partners these municipalities. We did the right thing by trying to help them right size their cost in sort of the time of trouble. We're frankly not willing to go any lower because we can\u2019t, and it\u2019s time for us now to expect lower fair and reasonable pricing mechanism in our contracts going forward.","The other thing remember is, four years ago when we were first living for the first couple of years in a slow CPI environment, nobody thought, nobody I talked to thought CPI was going to stay low. Now, back now four years ahead of that, where we are today and no one really believes that, no one see\u2019s CPI normalizing to its 25 year average above 3%. And everyone sort of agrees on the fact that the CPI\u2019s been manipulated.","So we can\u2019t live in that environment. And so we are moving forward, as I said, within new industries. We're not going do business or take new business that doesn\u2019t meet our return criteria. And we intend to improve this business over the long term. And we\u2019ve got some good traction so far.","Tyler Brown","All right, perfect. Great stuff, thanks Don.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Ovshey","Don, on the CPI point I think over the last couple of months, because it was actually, I trust, lower probably partly due to the decline in energy. Are you anticipating any potential headwind from CPI in \u201815 or is it going to be potentially more of an issue for the company in \u201816 if it stays at these levels?","Don Slager","You got it right, we\u2019ve got that sort of 12 - 18 month lag on CPI, that way it works to our pricing, and it\u2019ll be more of a \u201816 event for us. So we're hoping that these low CPI\u2019s are being forecasted. Start to bump up a little bit at the end of the year, but for \u201815 we won\u2019t have much impact from it.","Alex Ovshey","Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then on the closed acquisitions in \u201914, can you talk about what the expectation is for contribution to EBITDA from those acquisitions in \u201915. And I know you talked about - synergy acquisition of the pull, how long could it typically take to accomplish the synergies?","Chuck Serianni","This is Chuck, so most of these acquisitions are relatively small, but probably in the $2 million to $3 million range. And I would say that we can get them up to kind of the company\u2019s current margins relatively quickly. So they\u2019ll perform at pretty much at post synergy levels in \u201815.","Alex Ovshey","Appreciate that Chuck. And then just last question from me, you spent some time talking about some of the new customer service tools that are out there. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s early, but do you think that you could potentially reduce the churn rate in the business as a result? I know that the 7% number we always talk to, but is part of the goal with these in your customer service tools, that number potentially comes down, are you seeing any progress at all on that front?","Chuck Serianni","Yeah, the tools we talked about, the PBS and the Capture, really are focused at bringing our new business correctly. We think about defection, the 7% of the business that we lose, the way we\u2019re focusing on that Alex, is really through all of our customer service metrics. So we track across the entire company at every division, we track miss-pickups, we track service commitments, we have got a number of service commitments that each of our general managers makes to customers in each of our divisions. We know what their adherences of those commitments. We also use something called net promoter score, which we\u2019ve talked about in the past.","And we get direct feedback from our customers, every one of our markets. And how they feel about our service and whether or not they would recommend us to somebody else. So we focus on those customer metrics to understand how we\u2019re doing in servicing our customers and how they value us. And basically, we\u2019re trying to drive all of those metrics up, because we want to extend customer loyalty right? We want customers to come with us, we want them to stay with us, because we\u2019re a great service provider and then we meet their needs, and we handle all of that for them right?","That\u2019s our tagline; we\u2019ll handle it from here. So we\u2019re working on that, and can we get perfection down from 7%? Well it used to be 10, we brought it down to 7 and we\u2019ll see where we go from here. We do our best, we know our service metrics are improving, miss-pickups are down, service commitments are up. And our net promoter score has improved dramatically since we introduced it. So we also brought customer service metrics into our compensation programs for our general managers. So everyone has got some skin in the game now to improve the customer experience for each and every one of our customers. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking to get that done.","Operator","That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Slager for his closing remarks.","Don Slager","Thank you, Sheila.

Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results, which exceeded the upper end of our guidance range. In 2017, the team achieved strong growth in price and volume, delivered high single-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow per share, improved return on invested capital by 40 basis points, and increased cash return to shareholders by over 30%.","A robust financial performance continues to demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and our ability to create long-term shareholder value. Highlights of the quarter include adjusted EPS of $0.61, an increase of 7% over the prior year. Earnings were positively impacted by strong event-driven volumes and a net 3-cent benefit from lower taxes.","Fourth quarter total revenue increased 7.6% and includes over 5% organic growth, the highest level we've achieved in nine years. Core price was 4.1%, and average yield was 2.4%. Volumes increased 2.7%. Our growth in volume continues to be broad-based and remains strongest in the event-driven portion of our business. Energy services revenue was $46 million, nearly two times prior year's revenue, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.2% was in line with our expectations.","Turning to the full year, adjusted EPS was $2.43, a 9.5% increase over the prior year. EPS exceeded the high end of our upwardly revised guidance range by $0.04. Adjusted free cash flow was $934 million and exceeded the upper end of our guidance range. On a per share basis, adjusted free cash flow increased 7% over the prior year.","Total revenue was $10 billion, an increase of 7% over the prior year. Core price was 4.1%. Average yield was 2.5%, the highest level achieved since 2009. Volumes increased 1.8% over the prior year and included double-digit growth in event-driven landfill volumes.","And finally, we invested $437 million in acquisitions in 2017, and our 2018 pipeline remains strong. Throughout 2017, we continued to deliver on our promises to key stakeholders, including our customers, communities, employees, and shareholders.","For our customers, we strive to provide the highest level of customer service and are committed to developing differentiated and superior products that meet their wants and needs. Some of our accomplishments during 2017 included the following. First, to meet the demand of our customers, we expanded our recycling processing capabilities through the acquisition of ReCommunity. Our customers have told us recycling is important to them and have demonstrated their willingness to pay. Additionally, to ensure the sustainability of recycling, we have transitioned approximately 85% of our processing volume to a more durable, fee-based model.","Second, we continued to refine and optimize our digital platform to improve the online customer buying experience. We saw double-digit growth in online sales and the customer satisfaction ratings. Lastly, we completed the transition to our three state-of-the-art Customer Resource Centers. These centers are designed to enhance the customers' experience through a more professionally trained customer service team, improved technology, and additional communications channels.","For the communities we serve, we remain devoted to delivering safe, convenient, and value-driven solutions while being good stewards of the environment. In 2017, with respect to safety, we continued to see a favorable reduction in employee incidents, and our performance is over 40% better than industry average.","On the sustainability front, we were named to the gold standard of sustainability rankings for a second consecutive year. We were the only recycling and solid waste company in North America to be named either the Dow Jones Sustainability North America or World Index.","For our employees, we aim to be an employer of choice, one where the best people come to work. We accomplished this by creating an environment and culture in which all individuals feel welcome and valued, by training and developing our employees throughout their careers and by offering fair and competitive wages and benefits. We've been investing in these areas for several years, and our employees have told us, they see the difference, which is the true litmus test the impact we are making here at Republic.","For example, in 2017, we were named to the Forbes America's Best Employers List. We received a Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award, and we were recognized by Ethisphere as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies. Additionally, we have a best-in-class employee engagement score with high participation rates, and our turnover continues to outperform industry and competitor benchmarks.","And finally, for our shareholders, we remain committed to creating long-term value, and 2017 was a perfect example. Our strong financial performance included high single-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow per share, and a 40 basis point improvement in ROIC. We returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing a cash yield of over 5%.","And lastly, in October, our Board approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. This demonstrates the confidence we have in our ability to grow free cash flow and increase cash returns to shareholders while maintaining our investment grade credit rating.","Before turning the call over to Chuck, I'd like to make a few comments on tax reform. As a statutory tax rate payer, we benefit substantially from tax reform. We believe we have a responsibility to invest and deploy additional cash flow in a manner that will provide meaningful and long-term benefits to our employees, customers, communities, and shareholders. In 2018, we expect cash tax savings of approximately $190 million. As I mentioned earlier, we've been steadily investing in our people for years, and tax reform provides us the opportunity to accelerate some of these benefits.","Over the next few years, we plan to invest a total of $200 million back into the business, specifically in our fleet and frontline employee facilities. We believe these investments will benefit people for years to come.","With respect to our fleet, we will focus on replacing older trucks to help mitigate rising maintenance cost from increased complexity, reduce vehicle emissions, improve employee engagement, and maximize the benefit of bonus depreciation.","We will also be upgrading our frontline facilities to enhance the work environment for our people, specifically locker rooms, break rooms, and training facilities. This will help us continue to increase employee engagement and improve our ability to attract and retain employees.","Through data analytics, we know that as employee engagement increases, safety improves, turnover declines, and productivity rises, all of which directly benefit earnings and cash flow, ultimately creating long-term value.","I'll now turn the call over to Chuck.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Don. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of $181 million or 7.6% over the prior year. This 7.6% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 5.6% and acquisitions of 2%.","The components of our 5.6% internal growth rate are as follows, first, average yield increased 2.4%. Average yield in the collection business was 2.8%, which included 3.8% in the small container business, 2.4% in the large container business, and 2% in the residential business. Average yield in the post collection business was 1.5%, which included landfill MSW of 2.1%.","Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 4.1%. Core price consisted of 5.1% in the open market and 2.4% in the restricted portion of our business. This is the fifth consecutive quarter we've seen a sequential improvement in restricted core price.","The second component of our internal growth rate is total volume, which increased 2.7% over the prior year. Volumes in the collection business increased 20 basis points. Within the collection business, large container volume increased 2.3% and included a 3.7% increase in temporary C&D hauls and a 2.1% increase in recurring hauls.","Residential collection volumes decreased 1.2%. The decrease was expected and resulted from not renewing certain contracts that fell below our return criteria.","And finally, small container volume decreased 50 basis points. Small container volumes included a 110 basis point impact from intentionally shedding broker work, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes increased by 60 basis points.","In the post collection business, which includes landfills and transfer stations, third party volumes increased 9%. Landfill volumes increased 16.5%, and included growth in special waste of 37.9% and C&D of 31.6%. MSW volumes decreased 1%. The strong double-digit growth in event-driven landfill volumes will create a difficult comp in 2018.","The third component of our internal growth rate is fuel recovery fees, which increased 50 basis points. The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.87 in the fourth quarter from $2.47 in the prior year, an increase of 16%. The current average diesel price is $3.09 per gallon.","The next component, energy services revenue, increased 60 basis points. The growth in energy services revenue is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin, where we are well-positioned.","And the final component of our internal growth is recycled commodity revenue, which decreased 60 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales revenue primarily relates to reduction in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices decreased 7% to $125 per ton in the fourth quarter from $134 per ton in the prior year.","Next I will discuss changes in margin. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.2%, which compares to 27.9% in the prior year. The change includes a 40 basis point increase in landfill operating costs, a 50 basis point headwind due to a change in revenue mix from acquisitions and related integration costs, and a 30 basis point headwind from recycling. Excluding these items, we had 50 basis points of margin expansion from strong open market pricing in volume growth, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business.","I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.","Fourth quarter interest expense was $93 million and included $11 million of non-cash amortization.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 32% due to favorable tax settlements and tax planning opportunities. The net impact of these tax items increased EPS by approximately $0.03 during the quarter. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $934 million. Free cash flow exceeded our expectations, primarily due to bonus depreciation. On a per share basis, adjusted free cash flow increased 7% over the prior year.","Before I turn the call back over to Don to discuss our 2018 guidance, I want to briefly discuss an accounting change in 2018. Beginning this year, certain payments to customers that were previously recognized as cost of operations will be reclassified to contra revenue. Examples of these payments include recycled commodity rebates and franchise fees. The change will result in lower revenue and expenses with no change to EBITDA. The impact of the accounting change has been incorporated into our 2018 guidance, which is detailed in our 8-K filing.","I will now turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Chuck. Before going to Q&A, I'd like to review the highlights of our financial guidance. In 2018, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.05 to $3.10, which is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided last October, adjusted for the benefit from tax reform. This represents 27% growth in earnings over the prior year or 12% growth after normalizing for the change in taxes and recycled commodity prices.","We expect adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, which is also consistent with our preliminary outlook, adjusted for the benefit of tax reform. This represents 21% growth in free cash flow per share or 13% growth on a normalized basis. We expect annual revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. This includes average yield of approximately 2.25%. We expect the open market pricing environment in 2018 to be relatively similar to 2017.","Next, we expect volume to be essentially flat versus the prior year. In 2017, event-driven volume \u2013 landfill volumes increased 20% due to several one-time large soil jobs and hurricane-related cleanup work that we don't expect to reoccur in 2018. And finally, we expect revenue growth from acquisitions of 2%. This relates primarily to tuck-in acquisitions and rollover impact from 2017 transactions.","Next, we expect an adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.8% to 29%. 2018 net capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion. Given the strength of our 2018 deal pipeline, we anticipate investing over $150 million in tuck-in acquisitions. And finally, we expect to return approximately $1.2 billion of total cash to shareholders through $450 million in dividends and $775 million in share repurchases.","In summary, the current economic backdrop and industry fundamentals, combined with our robust acquisition pipeline, position us well to deliver another year of strong financial results. Investments we are making for the benefit of our people, customers and communities will provide positive results and create a long-term value for our shareholders. At this time, operator, we'll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Slager. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question will be from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Mr. Mazari? (20:48)","Mario Cortellacci - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, guys \u2013 apologies. Hi, guys. This is actually Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah right now. Could you give us a sense of service increases versus decreases in the commercial business? And are you seeing any changes in the competitive dynamics in the segment?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So no change. We would \u2013 just as we've said in the last couple quarters, sort of the net-net of increases, decreases are still positive, trending in the right direction. No real change in competitive behavior. As I said, I just admitted on my closing comments, the fundamentals of the business are strong with a really good macro growth environment as a backdrop. So again, that's what positions us, as we've said, I think, well for 2018 in a \u2013 just another good year.","Mario Cortellacci - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Perfect. And then just a quick follow-up and I'll turn it over. On U.S. tax reform, do you see \u2013 or do you expect any change in labor inflation, and could you walk us through how much of the cost structure is labor? And do CPI contracts offset any labor headwinds that there might be?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. So look, overall, our labor cost increases over the last several years have been pretty consistent. So, I'll start with that as a backdrop. Even when the recession was sort of at its worst, deepest, longest, we continued to adjust our people's pay. So we continue to give raises throughout periods of time, frankly where other employers were not giving raises. We continued to improve benefits. We continued to work on the work environment. So we don't see necessarily for us a big change coming.","We put a lot of effort into employee engagement and to make it a great place to work. And we put a lot of work into making sure that our frontline people and all of our people frankly are paid according to the market and fair to market. So, it's not like we've got this sort of pent-up issue. Having said that, wages \u2013 direct wages are about 20% of our total revenue.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. 30%. (22:56)","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","And if you add in \u2013 that's driver frontline, if you add in the maintenance wages in that part of SG&A, that's people, it's about 30% all in. And we've done a good job managing these cost. And we've done a good job managing our benefits while still providing competitive and good benefit programs. So that's not really keeping me up at night. I think we're just going to answer we're fine.","And then with CPI coming up, that just gives us additional help, right? So, we've been sort of the victims, if you will, of an artificially low CPI environment. And we've done a good job of holding our margins pretty strong through that. As CPI improves, we'll get some benefit. Remember, a little bit inflation ultimately is a good thing for us. So, I remember the days when inflation was sort of 3-ish percent. We saw that flow through our business pretty well. So that's not the \u2013 that's not worrisome.","Mario Cortellacci - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you so much. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Tyler.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Tyler.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, Chuck. So I'm curious on the 130 \u2013 or 110 to 130 basis point expected improvement in the margins, just how much of that is simply the mathematics of the revenue recognition impact?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","It's 100 basis points, Tyler.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So, apples to apples, margins are \u2013 you're looking for some modest improvement. But can you talk about some of the pluses and minuses in the margins as we think about next year? So I think we have the call center consolidation, maybe some easing landfill costs. I know we have dilution from ReCommunity and then commodities. But can you kind of give us some color there?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. So when you think about commodities, think about a headwind of about 20 to 40 basis points. When you think about change in mix primarily due to the ReCommunity acquisition, think about 30 basis points. So that would tell you \u2013 the math would tell you then that you've got 80 basis points of expansion just coming from the business. And part of that, as you had mentioned, is because of the CRCs.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. If I could just add something, Tyler, we're expecting to see margin expansion in all lines of our collection business in 2018. So that is the benefit of having great market position, of building density market by market, and again, that good macro backdrop. So, we expect to see that operating leverage continue to come through the business.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Very helpful. And then just real quick, Chuck, you'd given a longer-term EBITDA margin guidance goal, I suppose, of 30%, but given this change, is it just simple math to assume that it would be more like 31%?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","How about if I take that, Tyler. Yeah. We \u2013 as I always say, let us get to 30% and then we'll get to 31%, but yeah, it's just simple math, remember, the two big things that have kind of kept us down in the margin department has been this CPI headwind, right, and sort of fluctuations in commodities, and we had shared with you last year, pre-tax reform, that if not for those two issues over the last several years, we'd be sort of above 31%. Right? So that 30% is sort of realistic target. Adjust for tax, we're still going to move the margins forward, and again, a little bit help from CPI and our \u2013 sort of we got an internal program we call sort of Reimagined Recycling (sic) [Recycling Reimagined] (26:19) as we make that business better and more sustainable economically, we're going to get there.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Thank you, guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just on the topic of recycled commodity prices. They've started the year off lower than a lot of people thought, and I think that actually moved a little bit lower in the last month or so. And there's some speculation that China is just going to maybe not grant as many import licenses this year. So just wondering if you could provide more thoughts on that market and what your updated assumptions are on pricing and when and if you think prices might recover here?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes, so we've got $135 a ton in the plan for the year sort of through 2018. January is a little bit weaker than that, $120 a ton. So, our budget is $135, and we think based on what we know about the business, that it will come back through the year. And so we still feel pretty safe with that assumption of using $1.35 (sic) [$135] (27:27).","So let me just speak a minute about China, right? So, we historically have told you that about 30% of our fiber moves to China. Over the last several months, we've been moving fiber to different locations. And now today, this minute, only about 10% of the fiber goes to China. So, we've kind of isolated that issue, if you will, for the time being.","Having said that, I'll remind you that we've always felt and we always do produce a pretty good quality product. And so our recycle bales, et cetera, are pretty easy to move. We've never had to inventory material. We've never had to landfill material.","Our \u2013 so anyways, we've actually opened new markets in Europe and in other parts of Asia. So we feel pretty good about where we stand from a sort of a supply chain freight movement perspective. And then the free market's going to work.","And ultimately, the increase for consumer packaging we think will drive \u2013 mark the price back to where it belongs. And frankly, some of the bad actors that caused this problem in the first place, and we weren't one of them, they're going to have to get their act together, and then sort of the whole market improves. So we're still pretty positive.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And one follow-up, if I could. Just thoughts on how you would redeploy the sort of windfall you're getting from the tax benefits and the proceeds there between dividends, share repurchases, incremental CapEx, more growth, more employee compensation.","And just sort of related to that, are you seeing a change in what the M&A targets you have are asking for, for their businesses as a result of the tax reform? Or is it too early to tell a lot at how that would impact the M&A landscape?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","All right. So that was a pretty long question, and I'm going to give you a really long answer, how's that?","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Sounds good.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","So let's go back in time, right? So last fall, when we gave our preliminary outlook, right, about that same time, we also \u2013 our Board also approved a new stock buyback plan of $2 billion.","So at that time, you could sort of presuppose that if we \u2013 and we always do, right \u2013 sort of meet our goals around stock purchase, repurchase. So last year, we were saying, look, between the stock repurchase program and the sort of the dividend practice of the company that we expected over the next three years, 2018, 2019 and 2020, to return $3.5 billion to shareholders. Okay? Going forward the next three years, $3.5 billion.","The four years preceding that, we returned $3.5 billion. So four years leading up to this year, up to \u2013 through 2017, it was $3.5 billion over four [years]. Now we're saying, we're returning $3.5 billion over three [years], and that was pre-tax reform, right? So we're staying true to that.","And with tax reform, there's your question, what are we going to do with the windfall? So as I said in my comments, it's $190 million a year, because we're a statutory payer. And I also said by the way that we think the pipeline for acquisitions is pretty robust. So I'll come back to that.","First of all, I said in my comments that we're going to spend about $200 million of that right back into the business. So in two ways. One in fleet. So we've got this One Fleet thing going. It's great. It's working out well. We expect to continue to age the fleet a little bit over time.","But at the same time, we've got a lot of trucks that we sort of inherit through acquisitions that aren't really up to our standards. We have trucks that really weren't maintained very well from the beginning of time. We're probably going to buy some of those ages down. So we get a really good return on that by basically putting new trucks on the street.","So we're going to use some of that cash flow, that new found cash flow, to infuse some new life into the fleet. So that's going to be good for our productivity, our safety, good for our frontline people, because, as you know, the office that our drivers have is their truck. So our drivers should love that.","Secondly, facilities. So the other $100 million is back into the facilities and specifically for our frontline people. So we are going to \u2013 but we're putting together a plan now to go into our facilities and really start to upgrade break rooms, locker rooms, better locker rooms for our women employees, as we have more and more female drivers, and training space.","And we take training very seriously. We want to make sure that we've got a really great professional place for our frontline people that come to work to start their day, so we can send them off like professionals, and a great place to end their day.","So we think that is the highest and best use that frankly benefits the frontline employee directly over the long haul, and these are a lot of \u2013 again, we have a lot of \u2013 we have low turnover with a lot of employees with us 5, 10, 20 years, they're going to love that.","It benefits the local economy, because we'll be hiring local contractors to do the work, so that's infusion into the economy. And it's good for our owners, because as always, I'm a broken record, but we run the business for the long term. And my job definition is create long-term sustainable value. And we think that's the way to do it.","The remaining cash, hopefully, the pipeline continues. And we spent over $400 million in 2017. And I said in my comments emphatically that we're going to spend over $150 million in 2018, and we've got a little extra cash to buy some EBITDA. So any time we can continue to buy reoccurring cash flow in the business that we like and that we're pretty good at running, that's what we're going to do. How's that for a long answer?","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I got my money's worth on that one. So I'll...","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","All right.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","...turn it over now. Thanks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","The next questions will be from Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse","Hey, guys.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","How are you?","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse","Good. So I just wanted to touch on the volumes. So you're exiting the year at a pretty good volume run rate, yet your guidance is only flat to up 25 basis points. I might have \u2013 hopefully I didn't miss this in the comments, but why such a cautious view there on volume?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","It's really because of the special event volumes that we had in 2017. When you think about special waste in Q4, here being 37.9%, I can never remember a number that large before. So, that just creates a bit of a comp for us. But let me explain it this way also, Andrew. If you strip out the broker and the event business, then the volume growth in 2018 will be closer to 1% to 1.25%.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse","Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. And then just given the macro backdrop here, people are on edge with the markets, and given your leverage, I mean, can you remind us with regards to your debt, how much is fixed here, if there's anything you can do on the variable that you're looking at potentially, and maybe any interest expense guide that you can provide?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. So we're about 81%, 82% fixed. The rest is floating. And we're going to constantly look and we have constantly looked at making sure that we have the appropriate view in terms of liability management. And we'll see what happens in terms of rate increases in 2018. But I'd also say that we've already contemplated a couple of rate increases in 2018 in our guidance.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse","Okay.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Okay, let me add to that. We continue to believe that our optimal leverage, debt to EBITDA leverage, is right about 3 times. And anywhere between 2.5 to 3 times works for us, and so as long as we can continue to put money to work in the market to buy good business, to invest in the business, maintain our leverage at a very acceptable rate of 3 times, and to Chuck's point, manage that portfolio as well as he and the treasury team do, it's a good place to be. So, we're in pretty good position.","Remember too, right, I've got a couple things. Always remember, our business is a little bit different, right? Necessary service, long views into the incoming cash flows because of the large percentage of our customers under contract, long views in the outflows of cash because of the stability of CapEx in some of those cash flows or outflows, so \u2013 and also, we like the economy, right? So, the economy is doing well now. If the economy flutters a little bit, which we don't anticipate in 2018, we get a pretty good warning sign.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Right.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","And we get the sort of benefit from the ongoing housing and those kind of things at start. So that's one of the good things about the waste space. So we're...","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse","Okay.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","...in pretty good place.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse","Got it, helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeff Silver (sic) [Silber] (37:15) of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks so much. Earlier this week, I believe there was some information came out of the EPA about the proposed settlement up for the West Lake Landfill. I just was wondering if you'd give us a little bit more color in terms of things we should be watching on that front.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Really not a lot more color here. I would just \u2013 I would have you look to the public statement that Bridgestone landfill put out. That's really a statement that you need to check out and review all the facts there that you need. I would just add really the punch line, and that is, given the landfill did not generate this material nor did the landfill transport the material, our belief is that the landfill, it doesn't really have a much ultimate financial responsibility, and it should be limited. So that's really what you need to really focus on, and the rest of it is in the public statement.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Fair enough. And just circling back to the recycling issue, I think you had previously stated that a $10 per ton move in the commodity price had roughly a 3% impact on earnings. I just want to make sure that that still holds. And I think you had also stated earlier, when we talked about the potential impacts of OCC price declines this year, I think it was a $0.04 to $0.05 impact on earnings. Again, just want to double check if that's the last year. Thanks so much.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, actually, the sensitivity has changed a little bit because of tax reform. So now with $10 change in recycled commodity prices changes EPS by approximately $0.04.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And I'm sorry, the OCC impact on prices? The \u2013 I'm sorry, the...","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. The OCC \u2013 yeah. Jeff, this is Nicole. OCC makes up about 45% of the fiber or material that we sell, and if you think about the impacts of pricing into 2018, like you said, we said $0.05 to $0.06. Now, with tax reform, that goes up a little bit. So call it like...","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay for...","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","...$0.07, $0.08.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. That's really helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question will be from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. Good afternoon, Don, Chuck, and Nicole. By the way...","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Noah. (39:39)","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","...congratulations on receiving those sustainability awards. Nice accomplishment there.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Just listening to talk about the planned incremental investment in the fleet, certainly, we've heard a lot and read a lot about fleet technology, data, safety tech, I'm just wondering, is there anything that you're seeing? And if so, maybe a couple of areas where incremental technology is helping you see a better ROI to making those investments in newer younger fleets. Is there something there about the new fleets, is it just that they're younger? Because I think certainly getting your perspective as one of the largest vocational fleet, owners will help kind of clarify for folks what incremental technology, whether it's the alternative fuels or call it advanced driver safety, could mean for your business.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Okay, that's a mouthful. So as it relates to alternative fuel, right, we've been pretty busy over the last several years moving portions of our fleet toward CNG. And we'll continue to do that over time. And today...","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","19%.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","...19% of our fleet runs on compressed natural gas. So \u2013 and we started out by building more fueling centers and then kind of consolidating more and more, expanding to those spaces so we get the maximum benefit. As it relates to other technology, we for years have used camera technology and what I would call sonar technology like you have in your personal car that gives you an audible warning if you're backing up close to something. As far as technology within the truck that comes through the manufacturer, there are some really great telematics-type technology that we can use today that comes with the truck that helps us monitor, maintenance, other things. Those are great tools, integrate well with us.","We've always used a computer-based routing system to route our trucks. And we will, over the next few years, begin to move more and more technology into the cab. And frankly, that will help us, from a productivity perspective, from a safety perspective, but more and more, even to connect us to customers. So, we'll continue to go down that road.","As it relates to things like autonomous vehicles, we've talked about this a little bit. There's several levels of autonomy. And so, just like in your personal car, things like lane change warnings and those kind of things. Those are now starting to be developed by Class 8 truck manufacturers. We will put those to work in our trucks. And I think personally, we're quite a ways away from full autonomous vehicles. And I think frankly, our industry will be one of the last industries to go that way.","And one of the reasons is consider the fact that it's not only a truck going like down the interstate like somebody going from Des Moines to Omaha, but our trucks have to stop every so many feet. So somebody has to get out and open the gate and move a container, and that would frankly take two automated or autonomous vehicles to do that work. So now you're really starting to see kind of what we're up against.","But we are \u2013 I'll tell you this, we're the seventh largest vocational fleet in the nation. We've got some very good fleet professionals on our team, and we are at the table talking with manufacturers, not only chassis but also body manufacturers to take out weight to improve longevity and all those things. So we're not phobic about it, we're just being realistic and practical, and we're going to invest where there's a good ROI and we're going to keep pace with these developments.","So, right now, what we've got cooking for 2018 is baked in the guidance we've given you. And as we accomplish these goals and we get past to sort of the next developments, sort of the next investments we'll make in fleet, we'll keep you updated, and we'll let you work those into the numbers when it's time.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Well, thanks for that answer. Appreciate it. And maybe a quick one for Chuck. I mean, how should we think about the cash tax rate now as a percentage of book? And is the 27% rate kind of the right effective rate over multiyear period, or do you think you can do some tax planning to further lower that?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","27% is the rate that we're guiding to, and that's the appropriate rate for 2018. But having said that, we continue to look at opportunities to lower that rate.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Michael.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Michael.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, hey, Don, Chuck, Nicole. The cash tax rate, can we get that? Is \u2013 what percent of book is \u2013 or do you think you're going to be as a cash taxpayer?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","75%.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","75%. Okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","75%.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, all right. Your capital spending is up about roughly 10% year-over-year. So just want to make sure I understand the commentary about the $190 million in cash tax savings reinvest in facilities and fleets. So part of that, the 10% year-over-year increase includes that, includes probably some extra sell (44:59) development because you had so much landfill usage. And then we're kind of more normal overall spending rate.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, let's add growth in there, Michael.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Because we had pretty good growth, we had pretty good growth in the year, right, so \u2013 yeah, so, we had growth, you hit that. We've got a little landfill development which is good and part of it is growth. But it's still kind of hanging in that 10% revenue range, right? And then as I said, as you pointed out, $25 million-ish or so next year in redeploying some cash into facility upgrades for our frontline people and a little bit of fleet infusion here to get that ball rolling.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Which I think that answers my next question, so $190 million is the savings, but your free cash flow is only up $165 million relative to the guidance in 3Q. So the difference \u2013 that $25 million, the difference is what you're reinvesting year-over-year?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","That's right, Michael.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","That is the math.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","That's right.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Not bad for a dumb farmer. Corporate...","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","You said that, man.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I know. I know. Corporate rate savings out of the $190 million versus accelerated depreciation, how do I think about \u2013 like is there more to play around with on accelerated depreciation? Or is the $190 million the right number for good?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. So think about it this way, Michael, the federal rate is probably a $180 million-ish (46:22). And then you get about $50 million of bonus depreciation on top of that for the year.","But then you got a couple of negatives that you need to contemplate also. One is lower state tax deductions, right, because you've got less of a shield. And the other one is changes to the deductibility of certain expenses, right? So...","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","...you've heard about the change in deductibility of like meals and entertainment, so all of that nets out to the $190 million.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. All right, that's very helpful. And then just to be clear, if I were to take 3.75% off of the revenues and expenses of 2017, that's \u2013 and I could do that just to be able to have a \u2013 to see the comparable, keep the EBITDA at the same number, but the revenue comes down 3.75%, and then I can look at what my sort of comparable margin is 1Q 2018 versus 2017 when I reflect revenue recognition.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. It's about 100 basis points both years, Michael.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And spread evenly out throughout the whole year or is it lumpy?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, it's more or less spread out evenly.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. All right. And then within the context of the acquisition environment, how much of this is sellers worrying that in three years, all this tax benefit goes away and they better get this done now?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Right. First of all, I think that's five questions, Michael, but okay. Yes, so look, here's to our position. I think most of the selling that we're seeing just frankly happens to be companies who are getting to that cycle in their timeframe, okay?","And here's what I always try to say. Look, if someone started a business 10 years ago and they're still at a point where they've got the energy to build the business, maybe they're at a certain age or whatever, a little bit of tax reform isn't going push them at the age of 35 or 45 to sell their business, and they're probably not going to do that.","But if you've got a business that you're already in the window, you've already \u2013 you're already thinking about generational planning, you're already thinking about, hey, my whole life's work and my \u2013 I'm the third generation and in my whole family's work and it's time to monetize this, then yeah, I think maybe the tax reform might push you forward. But you've got to be in that decision point.","I mean, here's the thing. It's a great business. And we've got \u2013 there's a lot of small companies that we buy, tuck-in acquisitions. We buy some really nice companies that have run a long time. I mean, where these people have put their heart and soul into it, they've built really nice businesses, and they're not just going to walk away from them just for a couple of percent.","But you get if they're in the window, this may be what they've been waiting for. So we'll certainly be ready to do that. We've got really good people out there talking to companies who are thinking of selling today. That's why I say the pipeline \u2013 when I say the pipeline, it's not hearsay, it's people we've already talked to, it's people that we think are in the position to make a decision. So that's why we're confident in it.","But I don't think this by itself will cause each and every person to move. Remember too, the smaller the company is, the less taxes they pay. Frankly, very small private entrepreneurs, they're not paying a lot of income tax today, and their businesses are almost designed that way. So this doesn't really create a windfall for them.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very good. Thank you very much.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Great.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys, just curious in the volume. So I think you mentioned underlying volume growth of 1%, 1.25% in 2018. Is that a deceleration from what we finished with 2017? I would just think with the housing activity, the big growth you're seeing in special waste, which is typically a lead indicator, like why are we not seeing a step-up maybe in the underlying volume growth? Or is the mix in the volume growth changing?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","I think the volume growth is pretty consistent year-over-year. So in 2017, we reported a growth of 2.5% and that includes really strong special waste volume, C&D volumes, some of that actually coming through from the hurricanes also.","So when you factor all of that out, and you kind of look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, I think the volume growth year-over-year is pretty consistent.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes, so, right. We had the special waste we mentioned in the remarks, and we still have a little broker volume that we're walking away from. We still have a couple of national accounts that just \u2013 they're not making it for us. And we've got a couple of residential customers out there that we haven't been able to convince to pay us what we deserve, and we're going to have to walk away from those accounts in 2018.","So we're still taking a very strong approach to making sure we're getting the right return on the work we're doing, the right return on the investments we're making. And that's going to continue.","Meanwhile, again, we always say it, look at the cash flow. The cash flow is the story. And so we're getting our fair share of growth. As I said earlier in Q&A, we expect margin expansion in all of our lines of collection business. Some of that is coming from growth. Some of that is coming from good pricing. Some of that's coming from productivity.","But the business is healthy, strong, and we're making other very intentional decisions around volume to make sure that we're only doing what we're getting the right return for.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great. And just on the margin guidance and expecting 10 to 30 bps of expansion, I mean how should we be thinking about that through the cadence of the year? I think in the fourth quarter, you're still seeing this landfill operating cost still kind of elevated. We have the mix of the acquisitions. Could you just tell us how we should be thinking about maybe the first half or second half with that margin guidance?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Keep in mind that first half, we're coming off of commodity prices that were really strong. First half of last year, kind of circa $160 a ton. So, we would say that you're going to see the majority of the margin expansion towards the second half of the year.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's great. And just \u2013 if I could sneak one in, it's just on the open pricing, I think you said open pricing should be flat in 2018. I'm assuming that what that means is, I think open pricing was up 5%. So that's the kind of rate you guys would be expecting in 2018 with restricted prices moving up, or do you think open pricing is starting to hit that ceiling? Is that 5% number just kind of where \u2013 kind of as high as we can take it?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, I don't know that it's necessarily hit a ceiling yet. I think that obviously, 5% core growth on the open market is very, very strong. But Don had mentioned before a little bit of inflation, and not only does that help you on the restricted portion of the business, it also helps you a little bit in the open market. So I think that we've got a little bit of room to grow there.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Look, when customers are seeing inflation in their business, right, they're not seeing it from us, they're seeing it from other suppliers. And it makes it easier to have the conversation about what price adjustments are possible and necessary. So, a good \u2013 we've always maintained that a reasonably consistent inflation is good for our business. And if you look historically, it always has been, and if CPI moves higher, it helps us in the fixed portion. It clearly carries over than it historically has in the open market. So, again, we think the future is strong as it relates to that. So, when I hear about a little bit of CPI happening, I feel good about it.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And there appear to be no further questions at this time. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.","Donald W.

Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong finish to 2018. Full year 2018 EPS was $3.09 and in line with our guidance range. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion and exceeded the upper end of our guidance range. Total acquisition investment was over $200 million. Total cash return to shareholders was $1.2 billion, and total shareholder return was 9% compared to the S&P 500's negative return of 4%.","The team delivered these results despite a $145 million headwind from the recycling business. We accomplished this by capitalizing on solid waste trends to drive both price and volume growth, strengthening our market position, and improving route density through acquisitions, executing our plans to mitigate recycling headwinds in the short-term, while advancing our long-term strategy to transform the business, and efficiently returning cash to our shareholders.","Turning to fourth quarter highlights, we delivered double-digit growth in earnings per share, invested $87 million in value-enhancing acquisitions, and divested $79 million of non-strategic assets. We also returned $284 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Throughout the fourth quarter, the pricing environment continued to be favorable. We achieved core price of 4.3% and average yield of 2.7%, our highest pricing level in nearly a decade. We also achieved an all-time low customer defection rate of sub-7%. We attribute these accomplishments to our laser focus on enhancing the customer experience and delivering superior service.","Additionally, we successfully converted 27% of our CPI-based contracts, representing $660 million to a waste-related index or fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and continue to run higher than CPI.","During the quarter, we also continued to see underlying volume growth in our collection and disposal businesses. Excluding the impact of non-regrettable losses and a difficult special waste comp, total volume increased 90 basis points over the prior year.","Our recycling business also improved in the fourth quarter. The team continued to tightly manage operating costs and increase recycling collection and processing fees. As expected, the current market conditions continue to serve us as a catalyst to transform recycling into a more durable and economically sustainable business.","Additionally, we opened our first next-gen recycling processing center in Plano, Texas. We call it next-gen because unlike a traditional processing center, where we primarily sort and remove items that are not recyclable, here, we are leveraging state-of-the-art technology to extract items that are recyclable. This positive sort configuration allows us to produce a higher quality product with less labor.","The facility also includes a 5,000 square-foot learning resource center for the community, so residents can learn the proper way to recycle and reduce their environmental impact. Our partnership with the City of Plano is an example of our new recycling business model.","We are paid an appropriate fee to process the material and the majority of the commodity value is rebated back to the community. This contract structure enables us to invest in new technology while earning an appropriate return on our investment.","Lastly, given we operate one of the largest vocational fleets in the U.S.; we are continuously evaluating innovative approaches and technologies to improve the performance, economics, and environmental impact of our trucks.","Earlier this week, Mack Trucks announced our partnership to design and test electrification in a fully integrated garbage truck with zero diesel propulsion components. We are proud to be partnering with Mack and optimistic that this will result in a significant step towards an even cleaner, more efficient fleet.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail.","Chuck Serianni","Thanks Don. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $65 million or 2.6% over the prior year. This increase includes internal growth of 2.3% and acquisitions of 30 basis points. The components of internal growth are as follows.","First, average yield increased 2.7% and was the highest level we've seen since 2009. Average yields in the collection business was 3.4%, which included small container of 3.2%, large container of 4.5% and residential of 2.6%.","In our post-collection business, average yield was 1.5%, which included landfill MSW of 2.1%. The majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 4.3%. Core price in the open market was 5.1% and in the restrictive portion of our business was 2.9%.","The second component of internal growth is total volume. As expected, total volume decreased 70 basis points over the prior year. Excluding the impact of non-regrettable losses and a difficult special waste comp, volume growth would have been 90 basis points.","Volume in our small container business decreased 80 basis points as anticipated. This includes 130 basis point headwind from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable.","Excluding these losses, small container volume would have increased 50 basis points. Volume in our large container business increased 80 basis points. And volume in our residential business decreased 1.9% due to our strategic decision not to renew certain contracts that fell below our return criteria.","Next, turning to landfill volume. Landfill MSW volume increased 7.2%, while special waste decreased 11.6% and C&D decreased 10.7%. The decrease in special waste and C&D volume was due to a difficult comp in the prior year. In 2017, both special waste and C&D volume grew over 30%.","The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees, which increased 70 basis points due to the rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel increased to $3.26 in the fourth quarter from $2.87 in the prior year, an increase of 14%. The current average diesel price is $2.97 per gallon.","The next component, energy services revenue, was flat versus the prior year, which was in line with our expectations. In the Permian Basin, where we are well-positioned, drilling activity remains steady.","The final component of internal growth is recycling processing and commodity revenue, which decreased 40 basis points. The change in revenue primarily relates to a decrease in the number of tons sold and lower recycle commodity prices. This decrease was partially offset by the new recycling processing fee rolled out to our open market recycling collection customers.","This fee contributed 35 basis points of pricing. It's important to note that our average yield of 2.7% does not include this benefit. Excluding glass organics, average commodity prices decreased 15% to $106 per ton in the fourth quarter, down from $125 per ton in the prior year.","Next, I will discuss changes in margin. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 80 basis points to 27.4% from 28.2% in the prior year. This included 10 basis points of margin expansion from the solid waste business, which was offset by a 40 basis point headwind from recycling and a 50 basis point headwind from one additional work day.","Fourth quarter 2018 interest expense was $96 million, which included $10 million of non-cash and amortization. Our all-in tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20%. This includes an adjusted effective tax rate of 12% and a non-cash charge of approximately $30 million related to solar energy investments that qualified for tax credits.","Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.80 and increased $0.19 or 31% versus the prior year. EPS included a $0.12 benefit from tax reform. Excluding this benefit, EPS would have increased 11%.","Adjusted free cash flow for the full year was $1.2 billion and cash conversion was 42%. Free cash flow exceeded our expectations primarily due to better than anticipated improvements in working capital. During the year, we improved both DSO and DPO by approximately two days. This improvement provided a one-time benefit to free cash flow.","Looking ahead, I'd like to review the highlights of our 2019 financial guidance, which is consistent with the preliminary outlook we provided in October. For the year, we expected adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.23 to $3.28. After normalizing for taxes, our guidance represents double-digit growth in earnings per share.","Next, we expect adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion. Included in our free cash flow guidance is a working capital headwind of approximately $45 million and $50 million of incremental capital we are investing for the benefit of our frontline employees as a result of tax reform. Excluding these two items, our guidance represents high single-digit growth in free cash flow per share.","Total annual revenue growth is expected to be 4.25% to 4.75%. We expected adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by 30 to 50 basis points over 2018, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business.","Furthermore, given the strength of our current pipeline, we anticipate investing approximately $200 million in tuck-in acquisitions. 2019 net capital expenditures are expected to be $1.2 billion. And finally, we expect to return $1.4 billion of total cash to shareholders to $500 million of dividends and $875 million of share repurchases.","I'll now turn the call back over to Don to make a few closing comments before going to Q&A.","Donald Slager","Thanks Chuck. Our strong finish to the year positions us well for continued growth in 2019. We'll achieve this growth by securing price increases in excess of our cost inflation, growing volume for the seventh straight year, continuing to transform the recycling business by transitioning our municipal recycling customers to a more durable, fee-based pricing model and educating customers on what and how to recycle through our recycling simplified campaign.","We'll be executing our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation to attract and retain the best people, enhance the customer experience, and drive additional operating leverage through the use of technology.","And finally, effectively deploying capital to fund profitable, organic growth, invest in value-enhancing and consistently and efficiently, as always, returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","At this time, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","And your first question will be from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tyler Brown","Hey good afternoon.","Donald Slager","Hey Tyler.","Chuck Serianni","Hey Tyler.","Tyler Brown","Hey. So, I see in the guide that you're expecting 25 to 50 positive basis points on processing fees, commodity sales in the guide. So, I think that the RISI data that came out yesterday showed a dip in fiber prices. Can you just give us some clarity?","I guess, on the one hand, I surmise you've got continuing -- a push on processing fees, but it's a little unclear. Specifically, what are you kind of assuming recycling prices in the guide?","Donald Slager","Yes, so the guide has -- is about $505. I know it's a little bit lower than that right now but if you think about sort of how this thing normally works through the cycle of the year, we feel that it'll bounce back through the middle of the year. And over time, we'll average it at the right rate. So, underprice in the number.","Tyler Brown","Okay, and Don, I know you probably dislike getting that question as much as I dislike asking it. So, in that vein, do you think that, over time, Republic will really, for all intents and purposes, eventually inoculate itself from commodity price changes, really pushing the risk down to the waste generator? And if so, how long do you think that process might take?","Donald Slager","Well, I like your term inoculate, so that's -- we're all about that. So, if you think about my comments in we used our new contract with the City of Plano, right, that's an example of what we're doing. We believe the right way to do this is to get paid appropriately for the collection, we get paid appropriately for the processing, and I say appropriately, that means within a return that we can live with.","And there is a function in the contract for contamination that the cities and communities have to bear that burden, and in the end, that they get the benefit of what's left over, which is the commodity value less contamination. That's fair.","Again, we've made it increasingly easy for customers to recycle. We're committed to be a good environmental partner for those customers that want to do their part. But where customers don't want to be responsible, that's got to be on them.","And so we're only making investments in recycling going forward that have a true sustainability from a profitability perspective, and that has to work just like I described. So, we're having success.","And to be frank, there's all kinds of customers, right? So, we've had conversations with all of our 1,100 contracts. Some have immediately already agreed to new terms that work. Some have told us kind of, at this point, no way. And some have said let me think about it. We're in the second and third round of talks. We are going to continue to push this.","I think, frankly, any operator would have to be, I'm trying to think of a nice word, an idiot to sign up for recycling the old way when we've got this big, global, macro thing in front of us. So we did a great job. The team did a great job isolating the problem in 2018. We've done a ton of great work in 2018 that's going to anniversary and carry forward into 2019, and the work continues. We're going to have more success in 2019 than 2018, and that's one of the reasons we've got the confidence. But we're going to change the model.","And people tell us they want to recycle and I'm kind of a broken record around here. You're going to have to give us -- every homeowner is going to have to pay us about $1 more a week, and they're going to have to give us about two minutes more a day of their good, responsible time. And if they don't want to do that, we'll be glad to provide trash service instead of recycling service because we're really good at that.","Tyler Brown","All right. Yes, that's really good. And then one last one just on the volume guide of zero to 25 bps. So, can you talk about some of the puts and takes there? I mean, I thought you were largely through the broker coal lane. I don't think special waste has any real big comps. And frankly, it just doesn't really feel like a zero volume environment. So, can you just talk about what's driving that outlook? Is that just conservatism? And -- or is there something more idiosyncratic? Thanks.","Chuck Serianni","Yes, there is a headwind associated with the special waste that we have going from 2018 back into 2019. So, that's part of the reason why that volume growth is more muted. And at the end of this year, we're going to be about halfway done with shedding of brokers. But if you extract that out of the equation, if you remove broker volumes and those event volumes, the volume growth is closer to one to one in a quarter.","Tyler Brown","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Donald Slager","Yes. And let me add to that. On top of that, we've got some strong price here, too, right? So, we're being very intentional about where we can get pricing, and we understand the trade-off of price and volume. So, for instance, in our temp roll-off business and so forth, you know how that works, Tyler. So, if we can get extra point of price because demand is there, we might see -- we might give -- let a little volume go for that purpose.","Tyler Brown","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Donald Slager","Great.","Operator","The next question will be from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire","Hi, good afternoon Don, Chuck, and Nicole.","Donald Slager","Hey Brian.","Chuck Serianni","Hey Brian.","Nicole Giandinoto","Hey Brian.","Brian Maguire","Hey. A question on just the interrelationship between the CapEx and volumes because it seems like the CapEx will be up again and I thought of, in the past, the model being a little bit more like 10% of sales. It looks like we're going to be in that 11% to 12% range, 10% of sales if we're getting roughly 1% volume growth. And totally appreciate walking away from some broker business and some residential business that doesn't meet your return hurdles.","But I would have thought, with that would have come actually maybe some reductions in CapEx or shifting of trucks from less productive routes to more productive routes. So, can you help me maybe understand where this CapEx is being spent and where that number could be heading over time and in kind of a flat volume environment, why it should be so high?","Chuck Serianni","Yes. So, keep in mind that included in that CapEx guide, there's $75 million of what we're calling spend associated with tax reform, and that's money, as I said, that we're going to put back into the business benefiting the frontline employees.","So, if you try and you pull that out of the equation, then what you end up with is CapEx that's closer to 10.5% of revenue, which is right in line with where -- what we've told The Street that we would be at kind of post-rev recognition, which is, on a historical basis, is closer to 10%. So, that's right in line with our -- what we believe our long-term average should be.","Brian Maguire","And this will be the last year with that sort of outsized spend on employee stuff?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, we've got one more year, that being 2020, where we're going to -- we have about $100 million that we're going to spend doing the same thing. But keep in mind that we talked about this back when tax reform was first enacted going into Q4 2017.","Brian Maguire","Got it. And then just one more for me just on -- tax rate in general in 4Q was a little lower than your guidance. I was wondering if you could help us with that and then just thinking about the 2019 guidance. I appreciate the EPS is kind of in line with what you outlined earlier, but it looks like the tax rate may be a little lower. Just a little confused on that. Maybe I'm reading that wrong, but it seemed like it was 24% versus, I think, 27% before. So, just trying to understand the puts and takes there.","Chuck Serianni","Yes, so both in 2018 and again, in 2019, we're going to benefit from solar projects, these investments that we're making that come with tax credits that we're able to utilize in order to reduce our effective tax rate but also to reduce our cash taxes.","So, just to put that in context for you, 2018, our effective tax rate was 20.7%, and then we had a certain non-cash charges associated with those solar projects that are included below operating income, right? So, if you think about those two items together, then the net tax rate, including both of those, are just closer to 22.8%.","As we go into 2019, our effective tax rate is 24.2% and then we have about 3.1% in non-cash charges related to those solar projects. So, once again, if you put those two together, you end up with a tax rate of about 27.3%.","Brian Maguire","Got it. So, you're -- in those non-cash charges, you're going to include that in that EPS.","Chuck Serianni","That's included in our EPS guide, yes.","Brian Maguire","Got it. Okay, so laying that out to 27%. Okay, just checking on that. Thank you.","Brian Maguire","Welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari","Good evening. Thank you. My question is just around the cost side, specifically, how you guys are managing labor cost inflation, labor shortage. What's baked into your guidance there? I realize employee turnover is lower for you because every driver wants to work for Don Slager, but just any thoughts in terms of cost inflation?","Donald Slager","Yes, so our overall inflation, we think, for 2019 is kind of in that two and a half range. Labor will be a little higher than that. We do have pockets where we've got some labor shortage just because maybe there's local economic issues. Our turnover is essentially flat year-over-year. It's up a little bit with the growing economy, that's to be expected. We're not sitting on our hands. We're still working hard to improve the work environment.","Chuck mentioned some of the investments we're making in facilities and specifically around employee facilities, locker rooms, training rooms, et cetera. So, there's some labor pressure with long-haul trucking, which will impact our costs in and around transporting waste from our transportation to our landfills. We're dealing with that.","But we're also doing a great job in and around with our procurement team. They've got goals this year. There are some spend categories that we historically haven't looked at. So, we'll dig into those, and we'll find some savings in there as well. But the driver shortage, so to speak, isn't keeping us up at night. We're working hard to retain and attract the best people, and I think we're on a good track.","Landfill ops is going to be another part of the story. The leachate expense is going to be about flat year-over-year to what it's been this year, and that really is related to leachate because of just changes in POTWs or public treatment works that are changing their technology and starting to raise prices on leachate disposal.","That's something we can manage through and it's something we can price for. But I think that's going to be something, again, that affects all people in our business. And so I think, more than likely, you'll see more companies turning to some kind of price action to recover some of those costs. ","Hamzah Mazari","Great. And just my follow-up question, on pricing, you guided 2.75%. It feels like that's the highest price since 2009 or just prior to waste or downturn because you guys are late cycle. Anything different in this pricing environment that you see versus prior to the downturn? Clearly, there's a lot of changes in this space over the last, I don't know, 10 years or so. Any thoughts on how this pricing environment is different, Don? Thank you.","Donald Slager","Well, I guess, I'll say this, look, when organic growth is decent to good, that sets up the industry for better pricing environment. I've always said that. So, when there's decent organic growth, pricing tends to be better. The overall increase in capital cost, capital intensity, complexity of the business, I think, gives people a reason to price that maybe they didn't have before. So, that lifts us up a little bit.","Certainly, CPI has moved in our favor, and we're derisking our CPI portfolio. I'm moving to alternative indices that work for us. So, that's going to benefit us going forward. Moving to alternative index, we've said $660 million now of that book has been converted.","The hard work we're doing in and around recycling with the question that Tyler asked, we're doing a lot of contract renegotiations and new pricing. That's going to help. We've got recycling processing fee that we've implemented. That's going to add some lift. And some of these things aren't fully implemented yet, so we're -- we still got some time to run under them and have them build through 2019 and frankly, anniversary into 2020.","So, we think there's a fair amount of upside there. As it relates to just us pricing customers, we've got a lot better at it. We're smarter about it. Our overall defection is down sub-7%, which would tell you that, again, that's the lowest in the history of the company. We're spending a lot of time on customer experience, and so I don't believe you can just raise a customer's price. I think you've got to raise a customer's willingness to pay.","And so we're working on further improving our service levels, meeting our service commitments, improving our products, improving our fleet, certainly, having the best people on the front lines of our business. All those things, I think, give us pricing power in the end, and those things, we're going to continue to work on.","So, again, as you said, Hamzah, best pricing in 10 years basically. It's been building through the last few quarters. We're pretty confident we can achieve these levels in 2019.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and great to hear about solar project and electric trucks. Always nice. I wanted to ask you about the outlooks. You're reiterating the components of the preliminary outlook you provided in November and I think [Indiscernible] surprised by that. Investors have some to expect that consistency from you. The final numbers look to be the same. But has anything changed in the last three months within your assumptions, whether it's on volume, price, M&A or the cost side? And I ask in light of what is still a very sort of dynamic macro situation.","Donald Slager","Well, what's changing the macro is, last year; we spent a lot of time wringing our hands over to this China thing. We're no longer dependent on China. Our team's done a lot of work moving material to new ports, opening new lanes. All of our material that we collect is handled and recycled ethically. So, we've overcome the operational hurdle of that, and now we're settling into sort of a new cost model. So, working through that and I've already described what we're doing there.","From a growth perspective, right, we've always said we grow with population growth that drives housing formation, business formation. So, when there's population growth and there's job growth and there's wage growth, that's good for waste generation, right? So, as long as we see the same kind of housing start number and consumer sentiment spending is good, we think that's enough for us to continue to grow into the future. So, we feel good about that.","Chuck described some of the capital spending. Our CapEx is very, very consistent. Other than when we got the gift from the government with the tax reform, we decided to spend $100 million or so to improve our -- $200 million, I guess, to improve our customer -- or our employee facilities. And these are not offices for general managers and staff.","This is for frontline, hard-working men and women who show up at two in the morning and drive garbage trucks and fix garbage trucks and work at landfills. So, those are the people we're most concerned about improving their work environment, so we're spending real money for a really good cause. So, -- but that's not a surprise because we told you about that.","So, again, as you said, the business is very, on one hand, slow moving, which is maybe a bad thing for you, but it's slow moving, which is a good thing for you because it makes it predictable. So, it shouldn't be a surprise to anybody that our guidance is right on top of the preliminary outlook because we got a pretty good handle on our business.","And then what will change in 2019 going forward? How fast can we move on restructuring the recycling business? That's going to depend on customer sentiment. It's going to depend on how well the market adjusts. It'll depend on what other competitors do frankly.","But our resolve is greater than it's ever been, and we're making some really great headway and making great examples of where customers are taking a good common sense approach. And again, I gave an example in my written remarks. So, we feel good about the business. We've got a really solid team here and we're off to a great start.","Noah Kaye","Thank you for that. And just to come back to the labor question, I was really struck by the labor and benefits line. Expenses were up just 3% year-over-year. Obviously, that's a significant improvement in your cost containment. Anything you would point to in terms of kind of an improved success containing those labor costs? Anything we could think about going forward? Because, obviously, we saw a lot of growth over the first three quarters of the year and what you are sort of suggesting for 2019 suggests kind of a deceleration of labor cost inflation.","Donald Slager","Well, look, I'll hand that to -- off -- kudos to our operating leadership. They're really labor focused on productivity, on efficiency and safety. Employee engagement's a big deal around here as I said. I think we're probably the only solid waste company that does a nationwide employee engagement survey every year. 85% of our employees respond, which is double that of a world-class company.","Our employment engagement scores are high. Our people trust that if they give us their opinions, we'll listen and we'll respond. We really are genuinely in earnest trying to make this the best place to work or the best people come to work, and I think that helps us a great deal. And that's just not a slogan. It's what we really think. So, -- and again, our operating leaders echo that throughout the organization. So, I think that's part of it.","Again, every year, we get a little benefit from the things we do last year. So, we can continue to automate the residential fleet. We continue to make improvements in other areas. One Fleet continues to pay off. That investment, we don't talk about One Fleet anymore. But it's part of what we do now all the time and it makes us more reliable. Reliable trucks mean more efficient trucks. They mean more happier drivers.","So, we're just going to keep building on the Republic Way and year-on-year-on-year, we get better at the things we launched two and three years ago. We launched new things, and while maybe not one of them by itself is a game changer, it's the combination and sort of the sum of the parts that really make a difference for us. So, we're just going to continue to build on that. So, appreciate the compliment I think.","Noah Kaye","That's right. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will be from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sean Eastman","Hi guys. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Really excited to be joining the group here. I just wanted to touch on the M&A front. The $200 million planned investment seems to indicate an above normalized year, again, in 2019. That's expected. So, just hoping to get an idea of the profile of the discussions underway with your targets. Is it the usual singles and doubles? Or is there a good probability we might see something towards the upper end of that range in terms of target size?","Donald Slager","Well, it all depends, right? So, look, we wouldn't tell you $200 million unless we felt pretty strongly that we could deliver it, right? So, we've got a great pipeline and again, we've got a great development team. We've got a lot of good people in place now who've been in place for a while with all the business.","Again, we don't go around and sending sellers because these are good companies we buy. And if you got a really great company, you're not likely to sell it unless somebody pays you an arm and a leg for it.","So, when it comes time for you to be in that moment, where you reach your business life cycle or your personal plan comes to fruition and it's time to monetize your life's work or something else happens, some kind of a life event, that's when we buy good companies. And we've been able to keep our multiple really consistent over the year. We're not overpaying for deals.","And there are a lot of really nice companies out there, some really -- some companies of all sizes that we'd love to someday have an opportunity to be part of our network. And our job is to know the owners, to know where they're at in the life cycle and be able to write a check. And we've consistently done that. We've sort of built our momentum up over the last few years, and we've got the appetite to do very big deals. It's just a matter of whether or not it's their time.","So, it's kind of like when the seller's ready, we're ready. And we're very good at integrating businesses. And so we're, first and foremost, focused on tuck-ins because those are, again, lowest risk, quickest return, best returns. It doesn't mean we wouldn't look at a brand-new market. If we could go into a new market and have scale and vertical integration or at least the opportunity to over time, we would look at that. But you'll see us kind of stay in our lane.","And with most of the acquisition activity, we've got some good work in and around the E&P space, and there might be an opportunity or two there that we'd look at. But we're very diligent about the ROI in these deals. We always compare and contrast the better use of cash to buy more cash flow at the right multiple or buying in our own stock. We're very comfortable with the value of our company and what value we're going to create over the next three years. We always look at that intrinsic trade-off.","So, this is kind of our formula. It's been kind of a balanced approach of cash allocation, dividend, buyback, keeping a strong capital structure, keeping our debt where we think it needs to be, and having plenty of powder to do more acquisitions.","Sean Eastman","Got it. I appreciate that. And the next one I have is just on the differentiation strategy. You guys were speaking to the customer experience, customer willingness to pay. I was just hoping maybe you could talk anecdotally about where you guys have been finding -- you're getting some additional pricing power through that strategy. I just want to understand that a bit better.","Donald Slager","Well, we've had a lot of effort. Our marketing groups put a lot of effort into gaining customer insight. We probably spend more money on customer insights than any of our competitors really in getting to know what they think, what they want and for us to prioritize those things.","Some of them seem pretty obvious on the surface and some of them don't. So, there's a lot of learning there. We are -- we're looking at digital opportunities. We're looking at ways to make it easier to do business with the company. We do have a digital channel for subscription residential business that actually has worked quite well. And new business coming into that channel comes in at a higher price than if we were going door-to-door.","So, people are willing to pay for convenience and reliability. And so you'll hear us talk more and more about digital as we go through time, not only digital in the trucks, digital in the operations to make us safer and more efficient but digital as we connect more and more to customers.","And we think customers want to pay for that and are willing to because it makes their lives easier. So, we'll continue to do that. And then job one, though, is to get the garbage off the ground every day on the right day in the right hour, do it safely and be a good environmental partner, and we're pretty good at that too.","Sean Eastman","Okay, great. I really appreciate the time and insights. Thanks very much.","Operator","And the next question will be from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael Hoffman","Thank you for taking the questions. Don can you share with us where in the business model we're going to see the effect of the operating leverage? Is this going to be mostly OpEx or this mixture of OpEx and SG&A as we work through that 30 to 50 basis points of operating leverage?","Donald Slager","Yes, it's mostly to the OpEx, right? I mean, just to say, we still have some SG&A savings on the horizon. But I will say, look, and you always hear me say this, Michael, I mean, we've got two constraints. One is cash flow. We don't want to put so much cash to work on initiatives every year and the reason for that is we can only take on so much change at a time.","We got 35,000 employees. We're trying to lead them in a direction and we're getting all 35,000 people to buy into that plan. And so we can't overload them with too many new things. But there's benefit and then pricing, right? I mean, we're going to price to beat inflation. Years and years where we couldn't do that and now we got momentum on our side to do that as well.","So, -- but those things go hand in hand. Better operations mean happier customers, mean better pricing.","Michael Hoffman","And then on free cash flow, I appreciate the talks something about $200 million in the quarter. $225 million spending over three years is sort of the $50 million, $75 million and $100 million, so we invest into employee base.","If I get to strip that away in working capital timing things, how do I think about, one, what's the baseline free cash flow I'm starting with? And what's the sustainable growth rate? Your thoughts about that sustainable growth rate at that cash flow.","Chuck Serianni","Okay, let me explain it this way, Michael. If you take our reported free cash flow for 2018, so $1.178 billion and then I would back out about $45 million from working capital, which we believe one-time in nature. And then tax reform capital investment that you mentioned of $50 million, you end up with $1.083 billion and that was -- that I would consider to be a baseline. So, then if you look at that relative to the guide that we gave for 2019, that's about a 6% growth in free cash flow year-over-year.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. That's what I was trying to get at, is that's probably a good sustainable number. If I'm talking about a 4% at the top, getting the 6% at the cash is kind of a good relationship.","Donald Slager","Yes, that's right.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. And then just one more thing from a -- or maybe just two housekeeping. What's your share count in your EPS guidance? And -- go ahead, sorry.","Chuck Serianni","Yes, so the share count is -- for the end of the year is 323 million shares. And then we'd expect that to decrease by about 2.5% during 2019 because of this executing on the share repurchase program.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. And then in the 4.25% to 4.75% for total growth, so 1% is acquisition, is that all rollover?","Nicole Giandinoto","Michael, it's both in year and rollover. So, we do have a little bit of the $200 million that we're investing this year is going to benefit us this year.","Michael Hoffman","Right. So, if those get done earlier, that's the upside to that number, is what I was kind of getting at.","Nicole Giandinoto","Sure.","Michael Hoffman","Yes, okay. Thank you.","Donald Slager","Thanks Michael.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Henry Chien","Hey, good evening. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Just wanted to follow-up on that similar question prior on your cost structure and how you're thinking about beyond natural operating leverage, are there any areas in the business where -- I was just thinking of the technology that you mentioned earlier in your remarks that are opportunities that you could maybe make the sort of long-term margin structure higher.","Donald Slager","What's your definition of long-term?","Henry Chien","The next few years, so beyond next year.","Donald Slager","Okay. Look, there's a lot of upside left in the business, right? I mentioned just something like One Fleet, where we don't talk about it much anymore. Internally, we do quite a bit. Obviously, we measure it against the standards. But there'll be a moment when all new trucks come in. Every truck we have will have been sort of brought into life under the One Fleet banner, and we'll even have a better fleet situation than we have today, right? So that day is out there, but that is long term.","Some of this technology, we're excited about this thing we've got going on with Mack on the EV but too early to tell, right? But that's why we're spending time and effort on this because technology has a real place in the future.","We talked a little bit about technology in our new Plano next-gen recycling facility. There's sort of some technology yet beyond that, sort of robotics and things like that, that we're testing.","So, I will tell you this. I think there's a lot of opportunity yet with our digital operations initiative, and digital platform is kind of our fifth pillar of our strategy. But what I wouldn't want you to do is sort of run away with that too soon because we're involved in the conversations. We're involved in pilots and tests. We're involved in evolving technology where we can.","And as we get sort of the magic formula, we'll be talking more about it, and then at that point, we'll be layering it into future guidance. But it's more right now for you to know that there's upside here, and we're working on it. And there'll be a moment when it comes to realization, and we're going to have a lot of talk more about it.","Henry Chien","Okay, great. Sounds good. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question will be from Steve Schwartz of First Analysis. Please go ahead.","Steven Schwartz","Good afternoon everyone.","Donald Slager","Hi there Steve.","Steven Schwartz","If I could just continue on that question with respect to fuel recovery fees, looks like you, in your prepared remarks, noted a pretty significant sequential decline in fuel costs here in the first quarter. And I know that typically there's a lag between your recovery of increasing cost, which is certainly something that I think you faced over the past several quarters. So, as we look for 2019 and your cost versus those fees, can you give us some color there?","Donald Slager","Well, let me start. Fuel recovery fee isn't -- I don't think is frankly much of a story by itself because the purpose of our fuel recovery fee is to create a fair and equitable vehicle to sort of de-risk the fuel that at some times in our history have been pretty volatile. It's somewhat of a built-in hedge against fuel prices.","So, while it does go up and down and at times can play a little havoc with our margin because of a lag, net-net of that over the long-term, it doesn't really do much for us. It doesn't help us. It doesn't hurt us. It just sort of negates and offsets the volatility. That's the mindset.","Chuck Serianni","Yes. And then what I would add to that is that we anticipate fuel fee up in 2019. And that's really due to a couple of things. One is the CNG tax credit. So if you think about that had -- providing for us in 2018 a $0.03 benefit in OpEx and then a $0.01 benefit of tax, so that goes away. And then also, we had some hedges in place during 2018 that ended up rolling off. So, because of that, we're expecting fuel to be a little bit higher in 2019 than it was in 2018.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. So, in other words, that cost, you wouldn't expect any significant difference from the 25 basis points that you have built into your revenue guidance for fuel.","Nicole Giandinoto","Yes, that's correct. I mean, if you think about it, the 25 basis points that the revenue goes up; you'd have a corresponding cost increase, maybe a little bit more because the CNG tax credit isn't tied to the fuel recovery fee. And that's the only disconnection you might have in there.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. And then my second question, my follow-up is just, once again, an extension, I think, of the discussion that you had with Tyler on volume. Through 2018, essentially, your volume declined. So, from a comp standpoint, going through 2019, do you expect your volume to kind of play out through the quarters, I guess, in opposite or in mirror to what happened in 2018?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, I would say that it would be relatively close to what happened in 2018. The only thing I would say that we would need to be cognizant of are some of the quarters where we had especially heavy special waste volumes and C&D volumes coming into our landfill. That could skew the numbers a little bit.","Steven Schwartz","Got. Yes, yes, first quarter of 2018.","Nicole Giandinoto","Exactly.","Donald Slager","Yes.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. Thank you.","Donald Slager","I'll just add some color to that. We have a good outlook for growth this year and we've got a good handle on, again, our sales efforts with our good sales tools and a great sales team. We think we're winning our fair share of new business.","And at the same time, we're going to maintain the discipline to walk away from some business. We do have some municipal contracts out there that, frankly, don't perform very well for us. We're the incumbent, so we know all the costs and we know all the pressures. And when we're the incumbent and we know that there's no profit or not a reasonable return in these things, we're going to probably walk away from some contracts. That's baked into that number, right? So, that's going to continue. That's no different than it was in 2018.","So, you got to make sure you understand that. That's going on behind the scenes net of net. So, we're looking for our teams to either bring these contracts back around to profitability or move the equipment and the assets into utilization in other parts of the business. So, that's the guide we have.","Steven Schwartz","Yes, okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Feniger","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just can you help me with the 30 to 50 basis points margin expansion in 2019? Is this backend-loaded? Is there -- how should we think about the quarterly cadence with still pretty tough recycling comps in the first quarter?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, I would say that it's pretty well distributed throughout the entire year. You're right. We have a little bit of a headwind associated with the recycling in Q1. So, we need to keep that in mind, but other than that, I would say it's pretty well evenly spread.","Michael Feniger","Okay. And then--","Nicole Giandinoto","Yes, Michael, so -- Michael, just to put a finer point on that, so you're exactly right, as Chuck mentioned, our most difficult commodity comp, we still have a little bit of the headwind in Q1 just because that was the highest priced quarter of last year.","And then when you look forward, as Don talks about pricing, the pricing momentum will build as we go in and we renegotiate and we get more and more of our recycling municipal customers to agree to price increases. That will build.","So, you do see a little bit. Think about Q3 as kind of our strongest quarter and that's kind of where you build up in expansion in Q3. And that's kind of how you can think about the distribution.","Michael Feniger","Okay. That's helpful. And then did you say earlier in your comments that you had 10 basis points of margin expansion of solid waste in the quarter?","Donald Slager","That's right. That's right.","Michael Feniger","Yes. I'm just curious. I mean, if you're talking about shedding non-regrettable contracts, walking away from some of these resi contracts, which we know can be low margin, seeing the best pricing in 10 years and with the mix of the business, wouldn't we -- would we expect that number to be higher at this point of the cycle?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, keep a couple of things in mind. One is that we had a headwind associated with special waste, right? And the other one is that we had -- as we had talked about, a little bit higher cost from our landfill operated. So, that's masking or diminishing that growth that we called out.","Michael Feniger","Okay. And just lastly, that makes sense. On then on average yield, the 2.75%, like how much of that is just automatic from 2018, is just automatic from the CPI uplift? And how much of that is pushing on the open side?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, about 10 to 15 basis points is coming off of CPI.","Michael Feniger","Okay. Thanks guys.","Chuck Serianni","You're welcome.","Donald Slager","Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.","Donald Slager","Thank you, Denise. In closing, I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment, and dedication to operational excellence, and of course, creating the Republic Way.","Additionally, I'd encourage everyone listening to this call to take a few minutes and visit recyclingsimplified.com. It'd be good for everyone to learn how and what to recycle this very day. We all have an opportunity to do our part to create a cleaner and healthier environment. Thanks, everybody, for spending time with us today and be safe out there. Have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded.

Republic Services is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RSG. Your hosts for today's call are Don Slager, President and CEO; Tod Holmes, CFO; and Ed Lang, Republic's Senior Vice President and Treasurer. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Lang. Good afternoon, Mr. Lang.","Edward A. Lang","Thank you, Anna. Welcome, good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. This is Ed Lang, and I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Don Slager, our CEO; and Tod Holmes, our CFO, are joining me as we discuss our third quarter performance.","Before we get started, I would like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information that we discuss on today's call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties and may be materially different from actual results. Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.","Additionally, the material that we discuss today is time-sensitive.

Please note that this call is the property of Republic Services, Inc.

Slager","Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we discuss Republic Services' third quarter performance. I will review financial and operating results before discussing our updated 2012 guidance and preliminary 2013 outlook.","We recorded revenue of approximately $2 billion. Core price growth in the quarter was 1%, which was in line with our expectations, and an increase of 40 basis points versus Q2. Net price increase to customer, defined as price increases less rollbacks, was 2.8% in the third quarter. Landfill price increased by 2.7% in the quarter. Volumes decreased by 1.6%. The majority of volume decline can be attributed to contract losses we discussed on previous earnings calls and lower special waste streams. Although we saw an overall decline in volume, our collection business grew 0.3% versus the prior year. This is the first time collection volumes have been positive since 2008.","Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.47. This includes a remediation charge for a closed landfill of $37 million or $0.06 of EPS. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $480 million. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin was 28% and SG&A was 9.5%. Excluding the remediation charge and impact from net fuel and commodity, EBITDA margin was 30.8%. We repurchased 1.3 million shares in the third quarter for $36 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased 7.6 million shares for $208 million. We plan to complete our goal of $325 million of buybacks in 2012.","We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We expect to return approximately $650 million to our shareholders in 2012. This translates to a cash yield of approximately 6.5%. We have already met our full year acquisition goal of investing approximately $100 million and have purchased tuck-in acquisitions with $62 million of revenue in our existing markets. We continue to work on additional transactions and expect to maintain this pace of acquisitions in 2013.","Our safety performance continues to improve with a 5% favorable reduction in our frequency rate. We have seen continued growth in our recycling business. Q3 recycling tons have increased 1.3% over the prior year. The economy is still sluggish, but we have seen an increase in our temporary roll-off business, which confirms the improvement in the homebuilding statistics. It is too early to call this a broad-based recovery but our temporary roll-off volumes have increased by 3.8% as compared to Q3 2011.","As noted in our press release, we are reorganizing the structure of our headquarters and field operations, which will permanently reduce our annual SG&A cost structure by approximately $23 million. We expect to recognize a onetime charge of approximately $30 million for various costs, approximately half of which will be recorded in the fourth quarter. This reorganization allows us to maintain a streamlined structure that is responsive to market demands.","We are in the process of withdrawing from the Central States Pension Fund. This quarter, we took a charge of approximately $31 million for a partial withdrawal. We anticipate there will be future charges as we negotiate withdrawals for additional bargaining units. The liability is payable over 20 years and does not materially affect our free cash flow performance. This decision will benefit our employees and shareholders by limiting exposure to this critically underfunded plan and by moving employees to a well-designed 401(k) plan. We have amended our bank credit facilities to account for these potential future charges.","Tod and Ed will now update our financial performance.","Tod C. Holmes","Thanks, Don. I'd like to begin by discussing Q3 earnings and our full year EPS guidance. As a Don mentioned, our Q3 adjusted EPS was $0.47. Included in the earnings was a $0.06 environmental remediation charge for a closed landfill in Missouri. This was partially offset by a $0.04 benefit due to realizing tax credits on our 2011 returns. Absent these 2 significant items, adjusted EPS would have been $0.49.","Now in July, we provided full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.91 to $1.93. Since then, we have seen 4 components of projected earnings change resulting in a $0.06 reduction in full year EPS. 2 of these components I just mentioned: a decrease of $0.06 due to the Q3 remediation charge and an increase of $0.04 due to the Q3 favorable tax rate. In addition, there has been a decrease of $0.01 due to a decline in commodity prices and also a decrease of $0.03 due to the increase in net fuel costs. The net impact of these 4 components is a reduction in projected earnings of $0.06. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted EPS in a range of $1.85 to $1.87. This excludes the restructuring expenses we expect to incur in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Now turning to revenue. Third quarter 2012 revenue of about $2 billion reflects the following components of internal growth. Core price growth of 1% with positive price in all lines of business. Core price increased 40 basis points sequentially from 0.6% in Q2 to 1% in Q3. This was in line with our expectations. The sequential increase reflects the impact from higher CPI-based price resets in our restricted customer base. Our fuel recovery fee decreased 0.4%. The decrease relates to the lag between fuel recovery fees and the fuel costs when prices are changing.","Our fuel recovery fee lags the current fuel costs by 1 to 2 months. When fuel costs are rising, like they did throughout the third quarter of 2012, our recovery percentage declines until fuel costs stabilize. Conversely, fuel cost declined throughout the third quarter of 2011, which resulted in a timing benefit in the prior year. Our commodity revenues decreased by 2%. Commodity prices decreased approximately 33% per ton to an average price of $108 per ton in the third quarter from $162 per ton in the prior year's third quarter.","Our Q3 recycling facility commodity volume of 500,000 tons was up about 1.3% from the prior year. The full year guidance, which we provided in July, was based on our July average price of $116 per ton. We estimate current commodity prices of about $110 per ton. And again, for reference purposes, a $10 per ton change in commodity value equals approximately $0.03 of full year EPS impact. This includes the impact on both our recycling facility and our collection businesses.","Now turning to volume. Our third quarter volumes decreased by 1.6% year-over-year, excluding a 50 basis point decline due to 1 less work day. Most of the decline relates to landfill and transfer station volumes. Within the landfill business, special waste decreased approximately 10% versus the prior year. In Q3 of 2011, we had historically high levels of special waste, which creates a tough comparison for this year. We are also experiencing a slowdown in special waste jobs. In many cases, we've been awarded the work but the start dates have been delayed.","Our landfill MSW volumes are down approximately 4%, primarily due to the previously discussed loss in municipal disposal contracts and also competitive pressures that we previously discussed in our outlaying markets. As Don indicated, collection volume is positive 3%, this despite specific losses that we previously discussed. This level of collection volume represents a 60 basis point sequential increase from our second quarter performance.","Now turning to margin, I will discuss our third quarter year-over-year margin. Q3 2012 adjusted EBITDA margin was 28% compared to 30.7% in the prior year. This is a 270 basis point decrease. As Don mentioned, excluding the impact of the Q3 remediation charge of 180 basis points and the impact of net fuel and commodity of 100 basis points, EBITDA margin would have been 30.8%. Some of the more significant changes in margin include: first, labor, the 90 basis point increase in expense is mostly due to normal increases in wages and health care costs and a change in our revenue mix. Collection volumes have increased, which carry associated labor cost, while disposal volumes, commodity revenues, fuel recovery fees and subcontract revenues are all down, and these have little or no variable labor cost.","Second, our maintenance costs. The 70 basis point increase in maintenance expense relates to the change in revenue mix I just discussed. Also implementation costs associated with our ongoing maintenance initiative, an increase in cost of tires across our supplier base and refurbishment of containers versus purchasing new, which is a prudent cash decision.","Third, our transportation and subcontract cost. The 30 basis point improvement relates to a reduction in subcontract costs associated with a loss of a large national account, which we discussed in July. Subcontract costs tend to be higher in our National Accounts business.","Fourth, our fuel costs. The 20 basis point increase in expense is due to a 1.8% increase in the cost of diesel. After considering the impact of related fuel recovery fees, there was a net margin decline of 30 basis points. The average cost of diesel in October was approximately $4.09 per gallon, an increase of $0.31 from the $3.78 per gallon used in our full year guidance provided in July.","For reference purposes, a $0.10 change in diesel fuel per gallon is about $0.01 of full year EPS, which also includes the impact of our fuel recovery fees.","Fifth, our landfill operating costs. As previously mentioned, the 180 basis point increase in expense relates to a 37% remediation charge for environmental conditions at a closed landfill in Missouri. This charge will not have a significant cash impact in the next few years. As I mentioned earlier, this charge resulted in a $0.06 reduction in EPS in the third quarter. And excluding this charge, landfill operating costs were essentially flat from the prior year.","Up next is our cost of goods sold. The 70 basis point improvement relates to a reduction in rebates, paid for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold decreased to an average of $31 per ton from $55 per ton in the prior year. While the change in cost was favorable, when you consider the more significant decrease in related commodity revenues, there is a net 70 basis point decline in EBITDA margin.","And finally, SG&A. Third quarter 2012 SG&A was 9.5% of revenue. This improvement of 30 basis points primarily relates to a reduction in incentive compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in provision for doubtful accounts. Looking ahead, we consistently believe our annual run rate SG&A is approximately 10% of revenue.","Our DD&A as a percentage of revenue was 10.9% in the third quarter of 2012 versus 11.1% in the prior year. The 20 basis point improvement primarily relates to the favorable impact of landfill expansions in the third quarter of 2012. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles.","Ed will now discuss interest expense, taxes and free cash flow.","Edward A. Lang","Thanks, Tod. Third quarter 2012 interest expense was $93 million, which included $14 million of noncash amortization. Our Q3 2012 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by realizing additional federal and state credits on our 2011 tax returns. As Tod mentioned, this provided a $0.04 EPS benefit in the third quarter versus our original expectations. In July, we guided to a 36% full year 2012 effective tax rate. We now expect a full year 2012 tax rate of approximately 33.5%. Looking forward to 2013, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 38%. The higher tax rate has a negative impact on our preliminary 2013 EPS outlook of approximately $0.14.","I will now discuss free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow was $149 million in the third quarter and $480 million on a year-to-date basis. Free cash flow timing tends to vary by quarter due to capital expenditures and changes in working capital. The components of adjusted free cash flow are detailed in our 8-K filing. As a result of higher fuel costs and lower commodity prices, we now expect full year cash flow to be approximately $750 million. This is down $25 million from our previous guidance of $775 million.","Now I'll discuss the balance sheet. At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $854 million and our days sales outstanding was 38 days or 24 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7.1 billion at September 30, and excess credit available under our bank facility was approximately $1.4 billion.","I will now turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Ed. As Tod mentioned, we expect 2012 full year adjusted EPS in a range of $1.85 to $1.87 due to lower commodity pricing, higher fuel expense and the Q3 remediation charge. And as Ed discussed, we are reducing our adjusted free cash flow guidance to $750 million accordingly.","We are about midway through our annual planning process for 2013 and have not yet finalized the details, which we will provide next February. At this point, our preliminary outlook for 2013 EPS is approximately $1.90 to $1.92, which represents high single-digit growth after excluding the impact of a higher effective tax rate. Our preliminary outlook for 2013 free cash flow is approximately $650 million, which represents mid-single-digit growth after excluding the impact of higher cash taxes.","Now I want everyone to pay close attention to my following comments. This preliminary EPS outlook for 2013 assumes that fuel and commodities remain at current levels. It assumes no change in the economic environment and a higher effective tax rate compared to 2012. As Ed mentioned, the negative impact that the higher tax rate has on our preliminary 2013 outlook is approximately $0.14. Our free cash flow expectations also assume that bonus depreciation will expire at the end of 2012. If it expires, the negative year-over-year impact of bonus depreciation is approximately $150 million. It is important that you understand these facts and assumptions.","Now before we go to questions, I'd like to highlight a number of key achievements the Republic Services team has made. We delivered free cash flow performance providing a cash yield to positive price throughout the economic downturn. We've grown the business through collection volume growth and tuck-in acquisitions in existing markets. We continue to demonstrate an efficient cost structure, and we remain core-focused and well-disciplined. We're well positioned to take advantage of an improved economy.","At this time, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I guess, I wanted to start real quickly on the restructuring charge. I know it's not a big number. But perhaps, maybe some of the things that went into rethinking the organizational structure and the fallout, of course, is the dollar amount. But maybe from just an operation standpoint, why this makes sense and maybe why now?","Donald W. Slager","Well, I think it makes sense now because we've continued to develop strength in our team, we've continued to build our team, our people continue to grow and we have a high confidence in our region and area leaders that they can operate and lead larger geographies. What's important to note is our general manager business unit level has not been impacted. So we have not spread or expanded the span of control at the business level. Those 170 or so general managers still exist. Those position units haven't been impacted. So our area leaders and our regional leaders have to manage a little larger geography, and we believe they have the talent and the team to do that. Our Republic standards, our initiatives are taking shape and having good progress. And at Republic Services, we're always looking for ways to work hard and work smarter, and this is just one of those examples.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And then my follow-up, if I may, and it's sort of a broader question. But obviously, the free cash flow number, again, with all of the caveats is still a little bit down from '12. But is that pricing related in certain markets? Are you still seeing some pressure on that?","Edward A. Lang","Al, you're talking about '12 to '13, right?","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, I'm just trying to pick up the trend in the business here that if you...","Edward A. Lang","Well, actually, I think if you look at the normalized trend, free cash flow year-over-year would be up mid-single-digits. The headwind that we have in '13 is the exploration of bonus depreciation at the end of calendar '12. And the impact on a year-over-year basis is about $150 million. So all companies that buy heavy equipment have benefited significantly in their free cash flow performance over the past several years from bonus depreciation. Keep in mind, as recently as 2011, bonus depreciation was 100%. In calendar '12, it's been 50%, and in '13, it will go to 0%. So we're assuming in our guidance -- or excuse me, our outlook that's there is no extension of bonus depreciation. And if that is the case, the year-over-year headwind is $150 million. Now if you normalized free cash flow in '11 -- excuse me in '12 and '13 for bonus depreciation, as I mentioned, you would see a positive free cash flow in the mid-single-digit range. So we are -- from the ongoing business, we are seeing free cash flow growth. What we're seeing is the impact of the change in federal tax policy.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, am I able to sneak one more in here? Or is this...","Edward A. Lang","Go ahead, one more.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","All right. Sorry. So back to the pricing component. I guess, then the volume trend that you're seeing, you were a little bit lighter than we had expected. And I'm just wondering if there's something contractually or if it's just some of this commercial and industrial that you haven't seen the uptick yet.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, Al, this is Don. Special waste is really just a little bit lighter than we thought. Our commercial business and our collection business, as we said, is growing for the first time since 2008, so we're really happy with what's happening there. We did have the continued effect of some of the previously lost contracts. It really comes down to the special waste. It's a little bit lighter, softer and jobs are being pushed. We still have people saying they're going to let the jobs, but they just seem to be delaying when they're going to start.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the special waste question. So the slowdown that's being experienced, is that resulting in a stronger pipeline now because these are really just pullouts or pushouts? Or is this more of a cancellation nature? Can you distinguish there?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. I think it's just pushing it out. We've seen a slowdown. I think people just are a little uneasy with economic conditions, the fiscal cliff. At this time of the year, it's not unusual if the economy is not doing real well, that people start to tighten up their capital budgets, government jobs being delayed, those kind of things. So it's just a -- it's the event business we're talking about, not the re-occurring special waste stream to manufacturing.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, got it. And on the CPI, it sounds like it's providing a modest lift now based on the contract structure and the lag impact. Do you think it's going to provide more of a tailwind in the fourth quarter and beyond?","Edward A. Lang","Well, as we look at the pricing at the -- exiting the year, we looked at pricing will be at least 1% as we exit the fourth quarter. So I think we're in a good position versus how we were coming into 2011 as far as the trend in pricing.","Tod C. Holmes","And it's in line with what we had thought in line with our expectation.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And one last one, maybe you mentioned the $650 million of capital that will be returned to shareholders this year. Any feel for where that number might be next year in 2013?","Edward A. Lang","Well, obviously, we just increased the dividend in that number set. We expect to have $325 million of share repurchase available as we go into calendar '13. And as you know, Vance, we try to be opportunistic but kind of hold to our plan, but we just kind of work our way through the year. But we would probably have about $325 million available under the current authorization when we enter the new year.","Donald W. Slager","And remember, Vance, we're working off of a 2-year authorization here. So we have a good portion of that left for 2013.","Tod C. Holmes","But the cash utilization strategy is we very consistent. So it's the foundational dividend. It's that share repurchase 2-year program Don mentioned, and the it's the $100 million or so of tuck-ins.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, there's really nothing we see that would change our approach to that. We've got the tuck-in opportunities. We've got the dividend, and we still will continue, as Tod said, to be opportunistic in the buyback.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question was just around guidance. I know you guys said you're assuming the current economic environment, you're assuming current OCC and fuel. Under that scenario, what is your pricing assumption for '13 assuming you get the same CPI bump that you did this year? And what are you assuming on volume? I know you've had some contract transitions. What does pricing volume look like in that '13 guidance? And does that include a buyback as well? And if so, how much?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, Hamzah, as I said, this is not guidance, it's preliminary outlook. We're just in the middle of the business planning process. We wanted to bring to light some of these tax issues, so you guys had a handle on that. We'll see what happens with fuel and commodities between now and when we give guidance in February. As you know, when we give guidance in February, it's based on how we end the full year, the previous year. It's yet to be determined. And we talked about the fact that pricing now was up from 60 basis points to 1% in Q3. We'll see how that trend develops, but we're not really giving guidance today. It's just a preliminary outlook, and we're just going to give that EPS and cash flow just to kind of to get everybody focused on that.","Tod C. Holmes","And on the share repurchase, we've said repeatedly that $325 million, it was a 2-year program or a little over 2-year program with $325 million this year and $325 million next year, so that's consistent with what we said in July.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then just a follow-up question. On your collection volume being up, how much of that is just a general lift in the economy? And how much of that is you guys being more aggressive in the marketplace and maybe defending some business?","Donald W. Slager","Well I'd say it's a couple things. It's puts and takes certainly. We've won the San Jose contract, that's in there. We've got some puts and takes of large contracts. We've been very open with everyone about the fact that a couple years ago, we really started defending our business more ferociously against some of the sort of less rational smaller players. That's paid off because we begun to close a little bit the gaps. I would tell you we're losing less business today as a result of that. And Rule 1, when you're trying to grow, you've got to stop shrinking. So we've stopped the shrinking. We're defending our turf very well, and we're very specifically competing back in markets where we need to. We are continually pricing and our price shows that. And that's really all I can tell you. There's a lot of blocking and tackling and a little trench warfare that's going on in this business, and it's really no different than it's always been. It's been very competitive, but we're getting a little better at it in the trenches than we have been historically.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I appreciate that. Just last one, any update on the CFO search process?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, sure. We've got a great process, well defined. We're right on course and on schedule. We have a number of internal high-quality candidates, as you know. And we've got a couple of external candidates we're looking at. And we'll be bringing it to a close here before too long. But as you know, Tod is going to be here through May if we require him to, and he's committed to that. So we're right on course, and there's really no need to worry or hurry. But we'll have an outcome before too long.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Fisher with Raymond James.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just maybe for Tod. I know that the maintenance expense is up like $40 million or so year-to-date. How do we think about that expense into '13 in terms of the One Fleet initiative and kind of some of the puts and takes there?","Tod C. Holmes","Well, again, we're not going to really talk about '13 anymore than the general comments that we've made in the past. I think when you look at kind of sequentially how that maintenance expense rolls out, our container expense continues to be a little bit higher as we continue to repair containers. But that is the right cash decision. I would say that we're kind of working through the -- probably the tail end of that inventory. So as a result, that would drop off a little bit and we'd revert a little bit more to buying containers. And then on the One Fleet initiative, as we've said in the past, that's a multiyear program. We talked last quarter about slowing it down, but really, that slowdown takes a little bit of time to work through. So it will probably step down a little bit here in the fourth quarter and then be at that level as we go forward. The other thing that we have, which is probably more of a margin noise thing, is that change of revenue. Again, when you look at the total mix of business, and this is more from a percentage standpoint, the higher disposal commodity type of business gives you a lower percentage whereas a little bit more collection business pushes your maintenance costs up a little bit. So obviously, on a dollar basis, as we grow the business, as Don said, this is the first quarter since I think '08 that we see a positive there that in the collection business that there's going to be a little more dollars spent on the fleet.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe for Don, you mentioned the temporary roll-off was up 3-or-so percent. And if I were to think the sector hadn't really invested in roll-off fleet the last 4 or 5 years, and I know it's a smaller piece of revenue now. But if that stays strong on the volume side, could that kind of benefit price in that piece a little bit more given the capacity maybe?","Tod C. Holmes","That was the total collection -- Bill, this is Tod, I must have misspoke because I think I said 3% for the collection volume being up, and the total company was actually 0.3%.","Donald W. Slager","Temporary roll-off was up 3%, right? Temp roll-off...","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was just talking about the temporary...","Donald W. Slager","Temp roll-off is going to be construction. It's going to be businesses cleaning out, that type of thing. We haven't seen that kind of an uptick in a long time, so it's a little too early to tell. I guess that's what I said in my comments. We wanted to make a note of it because it's a positive, about 3%. So it's -- temp roll-off is only 30% of our total industrial line of business, right? So it's a small portion of a small portion, right? But it is a positive. We'll have a more on it as we see how things kind of develop through Q4. And obviously, supply and demand, right, Bill, if at some point that things start to take off a little bit, it should give us a little more pricing power. That's just how it works in our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Corey Greendale with First Analysis.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","First, I wanted to ask, Tod, when you went through the impacts to your new EPS guidance for '12 relative to the prior guidance, I was a little surprised that you were saying there's more of an impact from fuel than from commodities, just given kind of the relative movements. I just want to kind of confirm, had you assumed in the prior guidance that commodities were going to come down further? And on fuel, are you actually recovering less kind of structurally. Or is it just a lag issue?","Tod C. Holmes","I think you got it. That's exactly it, Corey. It's the lag. And then I would say the other thing is commodities have kind of come back a little bit here in the past month or so. So it's those 2 factors.","Edward A. Lang","It's about a 60 day to get the FERF to catch up. And I think what we saw here in the third quarter is that fuel was just continuing to move against us week-after-week throughout the quarter. So it was just you were kind of running after a higher and higher number and just the way the math works. It was difficult to have the FERF kind of keep pace with where actual fuel is going.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And on the impact of labor on margin, so I understand the mix issue, where do you think you're at in terms of kind of the efficiency of operations? The 0.3% increase in collection, obviously that's moving the right direction, but that's not a level where you think you need to be adding a bunch of labor, so are there opportunities still to kind of make that side of the business more efficient?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. We continue to work on our automation initiative, Corey, that's -- it's a long-term initiative converting our resi system from 2-person vehicles to single operators. We're going to be at this end of this year 63% complete. We might get in sort of the 80% range before we're done, so we've got some work to do there. We continue to work on routing efficiencies, and we'll get an additional productivity enhancement every year from those things. But we're pretty good at routing, so there's not a big material change. It's just constant steady improvement.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","If I could just throw in one quick one, Ed, I was hoping you might be able to give us a tax rate guidance just for Q4, given the moving pieces, I want to make sure I'm modeling that correctly.","Tod C. Holmes","Well, I use the full year 33.5%; isn't that what it is? So what -- look at the 9 months and just...","Edward A. Lang","Right. It's going to average 33.5%.","Tod C. Holmes","For the full year. So just force the fourth quarter to get you a 33.5% of the full year.","Edward A. Lang","It will be roughly equal to our statutory rate.","Tod C. Holmes","And again, the third quarter was the return provision true up where you typically actually file your tax return.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","If you were to go back to the beginning of when bonus depreciation was dumped upon us, I don't know, 2009. And you wiped it out and never happened, what's the free cash flow -- base free cash flow of the business?","Tod C. Holmes","Well, I think it's probably -- if we look at this year, it would be around $700 million. If we look at next year, it would be around $750 million, somewhere in that range. That's kind of that mid-single-digit free cash flow growth that Ed and Don spoke to. And again, if you look at the history of bonus depreciation, '08 and '09, it was 50%. In '10, it was 50% until September, and then it went to 100% in kind of in the closing months of the year, and then in '11, it was 100%. So we're getting a benefit this year, which is a combination of some of the late 2011 capital that we put in place where we probably overpaid a little bit our 2011 taxes. And actually, once we knew it was going down to 50%, we accelerated capital in '11, as you'll recall, to take advantage of that. And in this year, its 50%. So we think that we have probably I'd say realistic, but depending on what happens with all this political uncertainty, we don't have any bonus depreciation in for next year. If there is some, well, that's upside to what we just told you.","Edward A. Lang","And keep in mind, Michael, what we're seeing in the free cash flow outlook we're talking about is the impact of lower-than-average commodity prices that we're currently experiencing, above average fuel costs. But I think if you pull back and you kind of just look at the normal depreciation schedules because historically, we would depreciate equipment over a 5-year period, and if you looked at a normalized level of fuel and commodity values, I think what generally you see in the long term in this business is that free cash flow tends to run about 110% of net income. So there is -- as long as you're continuing to reinvest in the fleet, you get that benefit of the 5-year depreciation schedule. So this is a business that normally you do see free cash flow per share higher than book earnings per share, and that's one of the beauties of the business. But right now, we're just dealing with the volatility on a year-to-year basis, created by bonus depreciation. And then from an operating perspective, a pretty significant decline in commodities during the third quarter. Or as Tod mentioned, it has picked up a little bit here at the beginning of the fourth quarter.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","And then your dividend's now around 3.5%, if I'm not mistaken, your borrowing costs on 10-year or longer money is well below that. So why not fire a bucket of a money and buy a whole lot of stock back and play the spread?","Edward A. Lang","Well, we do like being investment grade, and I'm sure there's a few fixed income investors on the call that appreciate us saying that. So we do...","Tod C. Holmes","And there's also a cost associated with not being investment grade.","Edward A. Lang","And there is a significant cost with our -- keep in mind, we rely on letters of credit. We rely on surety bonds. We do like having or prefer to have -- and the investment grade profile we think is also a benefit for us as we look at municipal marketing opportunities, and having access to capital to expand our business platform through enhancing the fleet, recycling or tuck-in acquisitions. So we don't want to get distracted by some near-term events and be focused on the business for the long term.","Donald W. Slager","We want to maintain that financial flexibility, Michael, in the event that there is a business opportunity we can take advantage of, so that's critical for us.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Don, just one quick question for you. In your text and in your presentation, if I summarize, you believe the underlying fundamentals of this business are sound, stable and with an improving bias. But macro factors in the bonus depreciation create oddities but structurally believe the business is in a good fundamental position and improving.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, we think the underlying fundamentals of the business are very strong. We think we are well positioned to take advantage of improving conditions. We're very happy with the team. They're very capable of executing the plan. That's evidenced by the fact that we just reduced our area in the region -- our count and increased our coverage. We're that confident in their capability. Yes, we're at a unique point here where, as Ed said, commodities are below average. Fuel is way above average, and we have some of these interesting puts and takes here year-over-year. The -- we're still, as you can see, producing consistent cash flow. The business has that hallmark, and we think overall the industry is still fairly rational even though there's some noise out there.","Tod C. Holmes","With a good cash yield back to the owners through the dividend.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, so you asked me do I feel better about the business now than I felt last year? I would say, yes, I do. And we just have some noise here to sort out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Levine with JPMorgan.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A question, I don't know if you mentioned this earlier, could you quantify the dollar amount of the bonus accrual that was reversed, that was the component of SG&A?","Tod C. Holmes","We did not quantify it. I think you can see it in our SEC filings in the SG&A detail. Typically, this third quarter ends up being a little bit lower than our average of around 10-plus percent or 9.5%. So we had a positive net of 30 basis points but then offsetting that, we had some higher bad debt expense year-over-year. I will say this is not an unusual phenomenon as you go through the second half of the year, to true up bonus accruals. This year it probably is a little bit more than in the past because we've got the headwind from the commodities and fuel, which is bringing our EPS number down.","Donald W. Slager","Yes. So we're going to see around 10% in SG&A going forward. So this 9.5% for the quarter isn't something that we're going to carry into the future. It's going to still remain around 10%.","Tod C. Holmes","10% next year. And the puts and takes is cost savings on the reorganization next year and obviously, our bonus accrual next year will be higher than this year.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then I'm not sure if this is covered in terms of the remediation charge. So is that basically a one-shot deal with a cash flow impact of a direct magnitude a few years out? Or is it still a fluid situation where it's still unresolved?","Tod C. Holmes","It's a onetime -- the $30 million is onetime. The $23 million is ongoing. The cash impact is...","Edward A. Lang","About $2 million this year.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","$2 million. Got it. Okay. And then one follow-up on acquisition. So it sounds like you guys, you hit your acquisition target here in 3 quarters. Just wondering whether -- what your appetite and interest level still is and whether you're considering outside of traditional tuck-ins, I know that's traditionally been the focus, and whether you may overspend your budget if appealing opportunities become available to you, and whether you'd be willing to lever up a little bit more to do that.","Donald W. Slager","Well, I'd say this. We're always looking, and we've looked at everything, small, medium. We're looking within our core. So solid waste, North America, in the markets we're in typically, which is the definition of tuck-ins. We take a look at everything. We're very pleased with the ones we've done. If there's something else that came up in the remainder of the year, we'd look at it. But at this point, the idea of closing anything that's not on our radar today with this much -- with only 6 days left in the year is probably not going to happen. Where does it go from here? We think there's a pipeline that lets us do a steady diet of, call it, $100 million a year into the future, but we'll have, as we said before, the financial flexibility to do a little more if we run into good opportunities.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And what's your leverage as of the end of the quarter?","Edward A. Lang","You mean our debt-to-EBITDA?","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's right.","Edward A. Lang","About -- just right around 3x. That's calculated under our bank covenant.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I do want to ask the growth that you saw in the quarter, temporary roll-off, I think you said up 3.8%. How does that compare to recent quarters?","Donald W. Slager","Stronger, a little bit stronger.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So it's accelerating a little bit.","Donald W. Slager","Yes. I wouldn't get too excited. I think it's...","Edward A. Lang","It's coming off a low base. We have seen a little bit better temporary roll-off in the -- down in the south in some areas in the west, but it's kind of mixed geographically, but maybe some of the areas where there was very little activity are actually showing some new activity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, can you just talk about how you see the company's leverage through the nascent housing and repair and remodel recoveries as those markets begin to approach normalized levels over the next couple years? What kind of impact do you see that having on the companies volumes?","Edward A. Lang","Well, Alex, if you just look at our total revenue, C&D collections is about 6% of our revenue, and then C&D volumes at our landfills are about 2% of our revenue. So to all types of construction and demolition work, it's about 8% of our revenue. It's up slightly where versus a couple years ago, we were at 7%. So we're still at fairly low levels.","Donald W. Slager","Let me say that again, total C&D revenue 3 years ago or 4 years ago when we're at the peak, '06...","Edward A. Lang","Was about 17% of our revenue.","Donald W. Slager","And today?","Edward A. Lang","It's about 8%.","Donald W. Slager","Yes. So if '06 was normal, and you would argue it's probably greater than normal, and we're not saying we're going to get back to '06 anytime soon, but that's the gap. So today, we're up 9% of our volume.","Edward A. Lang","So still down 50% from the peak. Now what's a normal level? We're not going to go out there and try to give that type of guidance. We would just kind of report as to what's happening in the business. And as those opportunities come to us, we are seeing a little bit higher activity.","Donald W. Slager","And the good part is we're well positioned geographically in the Sunbelt in those markets that would maybe grow faster with population. We're -- we've got the assets, the landfills. We certainly have roll-off containers stacked up, and we're -- we sort of naturally get that growth as it occurs. It's not as though you got to go out and fight that hard for it; you sort of get your fair share, and that fair share would get us back ultimately to the numbers that I've talked about.","Tod C. Holmes","And as we've said before, we're late cycle so as we're clearing land, you're going to see all that activity. And then it's quite some time before they get into the anterior of the building where a lot of the waste is generated in the finishing process.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, so it's still a little too early to call. Let's just leave it there.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. My second question is, based on what you guys have seen out there and the trenches in the recycling business, do you have a view of the outlook for OCC price over the next couple of quarters?","Donald W. Slager","No, flat -- kind of flat's where they are.","Edward A. Lang","And we really don't put any type of forecast of OCC or other products into our outlook or guidance. So they're -- historically, there's a little bit of seasonality tied to holiday season buying. But other than that, we don't really see changes in the pricing. We just kind of assume what the current market is, is what we'll see going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli & Company.","Tony Bancroft - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Quick question. Just to go a little further on Michael's question as far as nontraditional acquisitions as regarding the R360 deal, what are your thoughts on sort of the drilling waste business and actually sort of dealing in the front end, not just sort of the back end of that business?","Donald W. Slager","Well, as I said, we're really looking in and around the core. That's not as core to us as maybe it might be to somebody else, and we're -- we think there's enough opportunity in the tuck-in arena in the markets we're in. And we think for us if we're going to spend $100 million a year in acquisitions, which is what we've said is a decent run rate, we can buy businesses in markets we're already in and businesses we're already in, and with that, we'll get the best return, the lowest risk of integration. It's hard work buying revenue in $5 million and $10 million chunks, but it's given us the best return so far. And that's where we're going to be focused for the foreseeable future.","Tony Bancroft - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Got it.","Tod C. Holmes","And we will participate in that energy sector to the extent that we have infrastructure in those drilling areas like Louisiana or Eastern Ohio. So we do see a piece of that business in our, which we consider part of our core.","Donald W. Slager","But purely on the landfilling side. We're not on the front end, as you said. We're not in the dewatering and in some of the other services at this point.","Tony Bancroft - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Got it. That makes sense. And then just one quick question, could you give us some little more color maybe regionally with what you've seen recently with landfill pricings or defending landfill pricing?","Donald W. Slager","I don't think there's much to tell there regionally. Our landfill, our total disposal price was up 2.7% in the quarter, so we're consistently raising prices in our collection business fairly effectively. We haven't seen any major losses of contracts in and around that space, and we think there's going to be a couple of areas to recover -- I know there's been some talk about what happens in the L.A. market when the landfill closes there next year, they'll see some things occur. But we think it's overall, a fairly rational market for landfill disposal.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question for you on your Industrial Collection business. If my model is right, it looks like this is actually the first decline since 4Q '10. I'm just curious, in talking to some of your customers, does this feel like more of a pause in activity? Or could it be more sustained?","Donald W. Slager","No, really that's just a combination of -- we talked in previous calls about one of our large competitors purchasing Oakleaf and that business being migrated over to their collection routes and then also the large, the big box retail store that was lost in our National Accounts system earlier in the year, and that's really it. You kind of net those things out, things are positive and going okay.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And changing gears a bit. I think one of your peers was out recently talking about a decline in rollbacks in the quarter. Is that something that's been broad based throughout the industry in 3Q? Or could be more of a one-off?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, I don't know. I think rollbacks are pretty consistent. The general state of municipal finance in this country with our public-private partnerships, as we said, we're probably kind of halfway through renewing that book of business. About $400 million or so of revenue comes up every year in that space, and our municipal customers are struggling in other ways. And so we've had some rollbacks there. We'll probably have a little more over the foreseeable future. I don't think it's going to change much. What has to happen is, generally, we've got to see -- to see meaningful movement in pricing, we're going to have to see CPI increase; again, that's half of our book of our business. We're going to have to see household formation, business formation, manufacturing pick up, we're going to have to see generally consumer sentiment improve and people feel a little better about the state of the economy and exactly, the tax space. So when those things occur, pricing will get better. In the mean time, we're pretty happy that pricing's moved up a little tick here. We're doing good on costs. The fundamentals are sound, so we're just working hard through it. And if things feel a little better today than they did maybe 6 months ago, but we'll see. We'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Slager for his closing remarks.","Donald W. Slager","Thank you, operator. We would like to express our concerns for all the areas impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Our thoughts and prayers are with you.

Republic Services is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, RSG. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Delghiaccio. Good afternoon, Mr. Delghiaccio. Thank you.","Brian Delghiaccio","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. This is Brian Delghiaccio, and I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services' Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. Don Slager, our CEO; Chuck Serianni, our CFO; and Ed Lang, Senior Vice President, are joining me as we discuss our performance.","Before we get started, I would like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information we discuss on today's call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties and may be materially different from our actual results. Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","The material we discuss today is time-sensitive.

When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website, along with instructions for listening to the live webcast of the event.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our third quarter results which were in line with our expectations. Revenues increased approximately 5% with a balanced mix between price and volume growth. During the quarter, we continued to profitably grow our business by focusing on attracting the right types of customers, differentiating our service offering and improving our service quality. We completed high-quality accretive acquisitions and have already exceeded our full year goal. And we remain focused on managing cost, improving productivity and leveraging our cost structure. We made great progress towards achieving our annual goal, and we are pleased with our third quarter performance.","Some of the highlights include third quarter EPS of $0.52, which was in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $433 million. This level of performance includes 84% of our projected full year capital expenditures. Core price in the third quarter was 3%, and average yield was 1.4%. Average yield was consistent with our second quarter performance even with a step-down in CPI-based pricing.","We continue to see better open market pricing to offset the CPI headwind. Third quarter volume increased 2.1% and was concentrated to event-driven waste streams. This level of performance was strong given the tougher prior-year comparisons. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $560 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This includes 8 million shares repurchased for $279 million. We expect to spend approximately $400 million on share repurchases in 2014.","During the quarter, we continued to implement our multi-year initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. For example, we continue to rollout Capture, our next-generation ROI-based pricing tool, and priority-based selling, our new standardized sales process. Both initiatives are focused on our open market commercial and industrial businesses. Capture and priority-based selling were designed to work together on the same cloud-based platform to integrate the process of identifying the right type of volume growth at attractive prices. We continued to make tuck-in acquisitions that layer in well to our existing markets. Year-to-date, we have invested $111 million to acquire $57 million of revenue at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 5x. Additionally, we completed the acquisition of Rainbow Disposal on October 1. This high-quality franchise business complements our Southern California operations.","Regarding our fleet. 14% is currently operating on natural gas, 68% of our residential fleet is now automated and over half the fleet has completed our One Fleet maintenance initiative. I'm proud of our achievements during the third quarter and remain encouraged by the underlying strength of our business. I want to thank the entire Republic team for their hard work and execution.","Chuck and Brian will now discuss our financial performance. Chuck?","Charles F. Serianni","Thank you, Don. Third quarter 2014 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $99 million from the prior year. This 4.6% increase in revenue includes acquisitions of 70 basis points and reflects the following 3 components of internal growth: pricing, volume and recycled commodities.","First, pricing. We had average yield growth of 1.4% and core price of 3%. Core price consisted of 4.1% in the open market and 1.2% in our restricted business. Average yield in the collection business was 1.5%, which includes 2.1% yield in the industrial business and 1.8% yield in the commercial business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.3%, led by landfill MSW, which increased approximately 2%. Fuel recovery fees increased 20 basis points. Most of this change relates to an increase in the rate charge to recover fuel costs. Fuel costs decreased approximately $2 million compared to the prior year and decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $3.84 in the third quarter from $3.91 in the prior year, a decrease of 1.8%. The current average diesel price is $3.64 per gallon.","Second, volumes increased 2.1% year-over-year. The collection business was positive 1.5%, primarily due to an increase in landfill and industrial volume. Growth in the industrial line of business was 4.9% and includes C&D and other temporary business, which was up 7.4%. Volume in the commercial business was up 1.1% and residential was down 60 basis points. The decline in residential was primarily due to contracts lost in bid situations. We will only renew business if it meets our return criteria. The post-collection business, consisting of third-party landfill and transfer station volume, was positive 4.1%, which includes an increase in landfill special waste of approximately 16%. Our landfill MSW volumes were up 1.8%. Our defection rate, which represents the annualized rate of customer turnover, remained stable at approximately 7%.","Third, commodity revenue increased 20 basis points. The increase in commodity sales reflects an increase in tons sold, partially offset by a decline in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices decreased 2% to an average price of $115 per ton in the third quarter from $117 per ton in the prior year. Current average commodity prices are approximately $108 per ton. Third quarter recycle volume of 569,000 tons were up 4% from the prior year. The increase relates to additional National Accounts brokered volumes. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased $7 million compared to the prior year, an increase of 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Again, the increase relates to additional National Accounts brokered volumes.","Now I will discuss year-over-year margin. Third quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.2% compared to 29.5% in the prior year, a decrease of 130 basis points. A majority of the change can be explained by 3 line items, most of which relate to onetime benefits in the prior year. First, landfill operating costs increased 60 basis points. In the prior year, we implemented a low-cost solution at one of our remediation sites, which resulted in a onetime benefit. Second, risk management costs increased 40 basis points. Risk management costs were approximately $12 million higher than our expectations during the quarter or 50 basis points due to a few large claims. On a year-to-date basis, risk management costs were 2.1% of revenue in both the current and prior year. Third, SG&A expenses increased 40 basis points related to a bad debt recovery in the prior year. SG&A expenses were 10.1% of revenue during the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, which was in line with our expectations. Of the 3 expense line items I just discussed, risk management created the largest variance to our current year margin performance. Excluding the 50-basis-point increase, EBITDA margin would have been 28.7%. All other cost changes represented 10-basis-point improvement in margin. I would like to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.","Brian will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow and selected balance sheet data.","Brian Delghiaccio","Thanks, Chuck. Third quarter 2014 interest expense was $87 million, which included $11 million of noncash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 37.1% of adjusted earnings in the third quarter and 38.4% on a year-to-date basis. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $433 million. Net capital expenditures during this period were $678 million or 84% of our projected full year spend. Free cash flow can fluctuate by period due to the timing of capital expenditures, cash tax payments and working capital.","At September 30, our accounts receivable balance was $955 million, and our days sales outstanding was 38 days or 26 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7 billion at September 30, and availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.6 billion.","I will now turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Brian. To recap our 2014 year-to-date performance, I am very pleased with our results and the progress we made in profitably growing the business and achieving operational excellence. Most of our business lines are performing well and showing strong year-over-year gains in revenue, EBITDA and margin. The one area of our business that continues to lag is residential. The residential line of business has the highest concentration of pricing restrictions, and therefore, the most exposure to low CPI-based resets. While we don't control CPI, we are focusing our efforts on the things we can control to improve our residential business. Specifically, we've reviewed all contracts to ensure we are realizing the full revenue potential for each contract. We identified underperforming contracts and are not exercising options to extend those without a price increase. We are working to convert new contracts to waste-related indexes versus headline CPI because they better reflect our cost structure. And we are designing and launching priority-based selling for our municipal business segment in 2015.","We will continue to offer high-quality services and products to our residential customers but must earn an appropriate return to deliver those services. In our earnings release, we updated our 2014 financial guidance that provided a preliminary outlook for 2015. We expect to finish the year with adjusted EPS of $1.93 to $1.94 and adjusted free cash flow of $675 million to $690 million, both are within the guidance range that we provided you in February.","We are midway through our 2015 planning process. Based on early reviews of the budget and assuming current business conditions, our 2015 preliminary outlook is: EPS of $2.02 to $2.06. This represents mid- to high-single digit earnings growth compared to our expected 2014 performance. And adjusted free cash flow of $725 million to $750 million. This represents mid-single digit to low double-digit growth compared to our expected 2014 performance. This outlook includes the benefit of extending the useful life of our fleet, partially offset by investments in growth opportunities and technology. Consistent with prior practice, we will provide detailed guidance in February of 2015.","We look forward to delivering on our promises to our key stakeholders, including our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. For our customers, we strive to provide the highest level of customer service. We are committed to developing differentiated and superior products that enhance the customer experience. For the communities we serve, we remain devoted to delivering safe, convenient and cost-effective solutions while being good stewards of the environment. For our employees, training and developing our people is a priority. We strive to be the employer of choice. And for our shareholders, we remain committed to creating a long-term shareholder value by generating consistent earnings and free cash flow growth while improving return on invested capital.","I would like to thank the entire Republic team for their contributions that have allowed us to meet our 2014 objectives and positioned us well for future growth opportunities.","At this time, operator, we'd like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So I recognize that the 2015 guidance is preliminary, but can you maybe just walk through some of the high-level assumptions like price, volume and maybe recycling?","Donald W. Slager","Now you know what, Joe, again, we're -- it's preliminary outlook, and we're going to give you detailed guidance in February like we do all the time. We're in the midst of the business planning process as we speak. We're just taking a look at current trends in the business. As you know, things in the business don't change rapidly. You understand the current CPI environment. You understand how the business works. And we're taking that current trend, kind of building it out into '15, setting goals for the field and understanding what the business can produce. So that's where we're at, and we'll give you more detail as we have it in February.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, I can appreciate that, Don. Let me try it from another angle then. I mean, obviously, we've got guidance and planning set for 2014. So Chuck, you highlighted the 3 cost buckets that could potentially be somewhat onetime in nature, but just optically looking at 4Q guidance and what it implies, it does seem to imply that maybe some costs remain elevated. Can you maybe just talk to some of the areas that we should be aware of for 4Q?","Charles F. Serianni","For 4Q or -- the year-over-year, if I look at the year-over-year, let me answer that. Right now, we had originally guided to 28.5% to 29%. We're trending a little bit down from there. But keep in mind that we've got about a 20-basis-point headwind because of commodities. We've got a headwind of about 10 basis points due to insurance, and we've got about a 10-basis-point headwind because of weather. So if you'd take all of those into consideration and add that back to the 28.1% that we're at right now, we end up being kind of on the -- within the guidance that we had given at the beginning of the year. So in terms of Q4, I don't see any significant changes in our EBITDA.","Brian Delghiaccio","One other thing to consider there, too, Joe, is that most of the things that Chuck outlined were actually prior year items that were onetime benefits in 2013 that just anniversary-ed, right? So when you talk about it in the current year, the cost that was an increase relative to our expectation was just an insurance item. So to Chuck's point, x that, when you kind of take a look at our year-to-date performance, we're kind of in line with what our original expectations were from an overall EBITDA margin performance.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Appreciate that. And one last one for you. Don, in the release, I think you mentioned that you guys have the ability and the intent to complete some larger transactions. I haven't seen that before. I'm just wondering if that's foreshadowing something or if there's any change to your acquisition strategy?","Donald W. Slager","No, Joe, and I think we've always said, look, we set our sights on $100 million spend. We look at a lot of deals to spend $100 million and do that intelligently. This year, we had a few more deals in the pipeline. And then, of course, on top of that, the Rainbow Disposal acquisition came into the market and we were able to successfully complete that. So we've got the capacity. We always say we want to keep our financial flexibility. Important for us to keep our investment-grade rating, keep that financial flexibility. We want to keep some powder dry so that when there's a good deal in the market, we can take advantage of it. That's exactly what you saw us do with Rainbow.","Operator","Next question is from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I want to -- can you add some additional detail behind the insurance, either I missed in your prepared remarks, or why is that elevated? And just start from there, please?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. So Al, our actuary reviews all open claims every single quarter. So when you think about that process of every quarter, it can introduce a little bit of volatility. But if you take a look at where we were through June, we were actually performing more favorable than our original expectations, and we expected that to continue. What we had was a handful of claims that we saw some increased development on in the third quarter. That was the $12 million that Chuck called out in his notes. But when you take look at a year-to-date basis, both in the current and prior year, both are running at about 2.1% of revenue. So what I would just say is that when we were standing there at Q2, expected the favorable development to continue, and we saw it go a little bit backwards in the third quarter.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just another housekeeping item. The $0.01 or so in bad debt provision, is that legacy? Is that -- what is that related to, please?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, that was a bad debt recovery that we actually realized last year. And so that when you look at the EBITDA margins year-over-year, that creates a headwind for us. But there was something that happened last year, recovered from last year.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I want to focus in terms of the core business. And I mean this genuinely here. Don, you had said the residential business continues to lag and the commercial and industrial, I guess, maybe you can comment on that whether that's in line with your expectations. But if I take a step back and look and add in some of the adjustments, it doesn't feel from the outside that the conversion rate on the margin is perhaps where it could be, should be and probably not where you wanted it to be. So are there additional areas that maybe you can highlight for us that maybe still remains a struggle, absent price?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, so let's back up a little bit further from that first, okay? So we have a backdrop where CPI has been averaging 1.6% for 5 years. And over that time, in total, a 1.6% doesn't get our costs recovered just through inflation, right? So obviously, we battle back every year with productivity measures and other things to improve our costs. I would tell you that with that 5-year low CPI environment and pretty steady inflation, we've done a good job running the business and managing the core business, but essentially holding our EBITDA margins flattish. And as Chuck said, if you take out some of the nonrecurring items, they're actually flat to better. So let's start with that. So that's what we've been working ourselves toward is improving the business in that low CPI environment. Again, as I said in my comments, CPI really impacts us in the residential business. And so to say it as clear as I can, the resi business is just a stinker right now. We've been dealing with these price rollbacks. It's a high capital-intensive business, and it's one of the reasons we're really tackling it and focusing in on it. If we step back and look at the other LOBs, we're actually doing very well. And when we do the netting of all the sort of individual issues, the growth that we're seeing in the business is coming in at a good margin. We are seeing the right growth in our commercial business, albeit slow. We've been bragging about the industrial business growing now for several quarters. That's continued in Q3. Finally, starting to see a little bit of life in MSW volumes at the landfill after many, many quarters of 0 to negative. So the rest of business is performing pretty well, and we think frankly very well in light of the macro environment. It really is this residential business that's been dragging us backwards. So, yes, let me just give you a couple of issues or a couple of details. We've talked about permanent industrial being up 5.3%. And in Q3, it was 5.6% up in Q2. Temp was up 7% -- over 7%. So in pricing, it's 4.8% in temporary roll-off. So we're managing that core business as it's recovering. We're getting more volume growth. We're getting price per unit growth, and we're getting some margin expansion. And now we're starting to see that in the commercial business. So again, it's early in the commercial. We thought it would be stronger by now, but it's positive and getting better. So we're not sure the trend is occurring as quickly as we like or it's probably as much as you would like, but it's happening. It really is residential for us. So I'm sure all of my guys listening on the phone right now are hard to work and figuring out how we're going to improve residential.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. Throughout the call, maybe you could comment at some point on the opportunity or the progress on the waste-related index pricing that could help you down the road and when that could start to benefit?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, let me comment on it. So I think that's your fourth question, but that's okay, Al. It's early. It's early. Here's the issue. I think the industry used headline CPI or some version of that in the residential business, gosh, as long as I can remember, and I've been doing this for 35 years. So we've always had that in our resi municipal business. And even in the municipal side of the landfill business, we've used that kind of an index. It worked for us just marvelously for decades because the 25 and 50 average of CPI is over 3%. And as we've grown our business and built density and done acquisitions and everything else we've done to build the business over that period of time, CPI never gave us any heartburn. It was a nice annuity business. Well, again, now we've had this really strange 5 years of averaging 1.6%. And if you step back and we'd go back in time, 4 years ago, we were probably expecting CPI to right itself. And every year, there's been sort of this sort of hint or promise that it could improve and it just hasn't. So we finally had to say, \"Look, enough is enough,\" and CPI isn't a fair way for those municipal customers to view our business and so we've looked at alternatives. And so if you look on the BLS, one of the components of the CPI basket is an index called water sewer trash. And we've been working on introducing that index to customers. We've done it in a very small way. We've done it successfully in a few small -- I would say very small type municipal contracts with some success. And we're actually using our industry association in things like SWANA and so forth to begin to have a conversation about what's reasonable and fair for cities to expect out of their waste hauling companies, and 1.6% CPI isn't the ticket. So it's going to take a long time to get that in the business, but the good news is, we're on it and we're working the system. And that's the expectation that my team has. And hopefully at some point, you think maybe the industry would support and catch onto it and do it as well because it's not good for anybody, and it's not good for the city because the city doesn't want to have a partnership with a company that's as important as a waste company to keep its streets clean. That's going to be constantly moving backwards in its profitability, or at some point, go upside down. So we have to -- we've got to right it and the gross operating margin in that business has shrunk because of this situation, and we've got to change it. So early stages. Hopefully, we can comment more on as we go through year-by-year and hopefully, we could see some kind of a shift in -- an industry shift as well. So that's it. But -- so we're not sitting on our hands, and we're not just whining about it. We're controlling things we can control, Al.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Levine with Imperial Capital.","Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","So a couple of questions. Firstly, special waste volumes are very good in the quarter. I'm wondering if that's project-specific, how the pipeline looks in general, we can see this type of growth continue or what's behind it?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, it's pretty broad-based. We don't have any really, really big, big projects to report, and that's the good news. A pretty strong growth. Most of it is soil-related. So contaminated soil, which I always look at that, Scott, and think that's a good sign of construction and development to come when they're doing land clearing and taking off the soil it means that they're going to build something new at an old site. So hopefully, that continues to fuel construction for us into the out years. So again, broad-based, and we think the trend should continue forward.","Scott Justin Levine - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And as my follow-up, maybe a little bit of color or update on One Fleet. I think you said more than 50% of the fleet is there. Are you guys running positive on that? And should we be thinking about that as potentially a margin contributor, a needle moving margin contributor and\/or a free cash flow contributor to the positive in 2015?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. So it's moving a little slower still than we'd hoped, but we're more committed to it than we ever have been. So let me give you a couple of comments. First and maybe foremost, it is going to contribute to us spending $40 million less next year on truck capital. So as we said, we're going to aged our fleet and extend the useful life of it to the tune of $200 million capital savings over 5 years starting in '15. So we're committed to that. And in the One Fleet divisions, we're seeing very good results. So let me give you a couple of stats. Maintenance cost per engine hour in One Fleet divisions has improved by 1% to 2%. Driver productivity in One Fleet sites has contributed approximately $2.5 million to productivity in '14. One Fleet divisions have 30% fewer unscheduled repairs and 25% higher truck availability or we'd call fleet reliability. So we think that's going to convert to what we would think as a lower driver turnover rate, higher employee satisfaction at some point, more customer experience and improved customer experience because our fleet's up and running, and we're servicing the customers better. So we're very, very focused here on how we can take care of our customers from a service delivery perspective and a differentiation perspective, so we can improve the quality of revenue. And our technician turnover's lower, substantially lower at One Fleet sites and it's really hard today to find good diesel technicians. And so all of those things are real. The divisions that we're in now that were converting to One Fleet, it's a lot of heavy lifting, and those divisions are probably costing us a little more than we thought they would going into Q3 and 4. But it's going to come around and at some point, this sort of backlog of workload is going to be behind us. We're going to anniversary that, and we're going to get those benefits. We're going to get all those other softer benefits I just mentioned, Scott, and we're certainly going to be able to extend the life of the fleet in a very methodical and thoughtful way without interrupting the business, and again, improving the service quality all along the route. So we're going to get it done and just again, it's just harder than we imagined. But it's the absolute right thing for the business. And we've got to think beyond the quarter, right? We're never going to be at Republic a slave to the quarter or a hostage to consensus. We're going to have to run the business for the long term and do the sustainable right thing for the business.","Operator","Next is Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. So first on the volume, just looking at the big picture. It's a pretty solid number in the third quarter. And I say that because last year in the third quarter, you had a nice strong number as well. So you were able to deliver a nice number again in what I would say a tough comp. And so a 2-part question there. I mean, does that imply that sort of the economy and the construction markets are sort of in a cycle where we can continue to expect sort of a 1% to 2% volume number out of Republic going forward? And the second part to that, is the volume number you guys are reporting, is that really what you're seeing in your end market or is there some market share gains that is helping benefit your volumes right now?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, so again, we're not giving guidance for '15. We are seeing good and steady volume growth. Again, the business grows, as you know, through population growth that fuels housing information, fuels business formation. So as long as those dynamics continue, we'll benefit from it. Housing starts are still well below the 25- and 50-year average. So could it improve from there? It could, but we're not seeing that yet. We're -- I would tell you that we're getting our fair share of organic growth, and we're replacing the business that we're losing. So again, we've got the 7% defection every year. More than half of that is competitive. So we replace that business. We're doing a good job of replacing that volume, albeit at a lower average rate, and so there's that churn issue that impacts us. But we're getting the volume replaced, and we're getting our fair share of new organic growth. That's really our goal. On top of that, we've got to replace those units at a slightly higher rate than we have historically and that's really our focus with things like Capture and priority-based selling. We're really hyper-focused on, internally, what we call quality revenue. Again, as I said to Scott, really focused on the customer service delivery and on everything on that end, but we're also focused on the selling processes, that point-of-sale decision making that we're doing to make sure that we're signing on those new customers at higher rates year-over-year. So the things we are doing are going to continue. If the macro environment continues, you'll get kind of more the same. And but the same thing is true with CPI, right? We don't have any indication in '15 that CPI is somehow going to magically get better. And it's an 18-month lag for CPI to work through our system. So you can sort of factor that commentary into why we're giving you this 2015 preliminary outlook.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, Don. And just on the pricing side. So going back to the point around potentially changing some of the residential contracts and what index they're linked to. I mean, is there any timeline you could provide around when we should expect enough progress so it would move the needle on the bottom line? And the second part to that question, I'll turn it over. You have some really big residential contract out there. I mean, where is it in the Q in terms of actually going and speaking to the folks who are responsible for those contracts and potentially changing the index structure there?","Donald W. Slager","Well, look, one, it's lumpy, right? The contracts in that business are generally 5 years. So one, we're not going to have 100% success rate. Let's be fair. We'd like to think over time, if the industry itself determines that the water sewer trash index is a fair way to go, and we can start to get cities to believe that is true, then it can maybe get some traction. But it's a 5-year process to work through the entire book of business. It could've been a bit longer because we've got some contracts that are 7-year contracts, right? So -- and some even longer than that. But I think the bigger franchise type agreements, the contracts are longer. However, I would say this that those contracts they tend to be more like real true public private partnerships, where we really are extension of the city and maybe because of the great job we're doing and so forth, we might have some opportunity to deal with that. So look, it's going to be a long road. But there's nothing I'm reading that's telling you that CPI is going to get better in a year or 2. There's a lot of commentary out there that informs our thinking that it could be this way for some time, and we just decided we can't wait anymore for CPI to right itself. So the decades that we've benefited from CPI, we don't know when that's going to come back. So everything else that we're doing to improve the business, Capture, priority-based selling, improving the customer experience, all of the work we're putting into trying to drive a higher quality of revenue, extend customer loyalty and earn the price increases year-on-year, we're going to continue to do that. And if CPI comes back, then that'll be a wonderful thing, and it looks to be icing on the cake for us.","Operator","The next question is from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli.","Tony Bancroft - G. Research, Inc.","Just a quick question on the pricing dynamics on the street. We've heard from your competitor's recent calls talking about holding yield and pricing. I just want to sort of get your view what you're seeing out there, if that's what you're seeing or something different?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. So look, our view hasn't changed. Let me start with that, right? So the price volume discussion is always kind of a bifurcated discussion and people sort of get lost in some of the commentary that companies are sharing. We have -- again, a big part of our business is restricted, limited by contract to CPI. Again, not whining about that. It is just what it is. I can't go in and magically change that. What we've said going into '14 is that we would go into the open market that didn't have the restrictions stronger to offset some of the pricing that we've lost in CPI. And we've done that this year. And the open market has held up very nicely. Our open market core price is substantially better than our average, okay? So the core market, meaning, or the open market, meaning open market commercial small container business and open market industrial. So that -- part of that's construction and part of that is permanent business. So that open market has held up well. So if you look at the pricing dynamic in that market, it's done okay. It could be better if the landfill pricing was moving. And that's the thing that doesn't get enough discussion. The fact is, again, Republic has done a very deliberate job of moving landfill prices forward. You've heard me talk about the fact that we've, year-on-year, lost landfill volume. It's the first quarter in I don't remember how many quarters, but maybe 10 or 12, maybe 16, I have no idea, that we've actually seen positive MSW volume growth. And that's just kind of keeping pace now with sort of normal -- some of the construction -- some of the other growth that's in the market. But that's really the issue for us is what will happen with landfill pricing going forward. We're going to continue to do what we do, and we'd like to think that as the market gets better, as the economy improves, that we could see landfill pricing moving at a more solid rate to support the underlying economics of supply and demand in the business. The other thing, obviously, is we've got a big presence in these markets. We tend to be #1 or #2 in size, and market density does drive margin and hold margin, and we don't want to get to a point where we're seeing gaps develop in our density. So replacing that 7% defection every year, trying to do it better than before using these new tools and training that we've talked about now extensively. And so back to my opening comment, I'll close with that. We haven't changed our tune on landfill pricing certainly and on price volume overall.","Tony Bancroft - G. Research, Inc.","Got it. And I know you spoken about, you always talk about $100 million of M&A and looking at tuck-ins inside your markets, is there any update or what would it be, what would it take to go outside your market, what would you be looking at for there? And are there any -- you said you're always going out in the market and looking. Are there any possibilities that have come up recently or -- that you are interested in?","Donald W. Slager","Well, I'm just going to -- we're going to stick with our $100 million general goal. There are some opportunities out there that you people are probably aware of, some big deals in the market that private equity deals coming back to market. We generally look at everything, Tony, in the marketplace, but primarily, we like the tuck-in business because it comes at the lowest multiple, post-synergy. It comes at the lowest risk of integration because we already have management and facilities and infrastructure in place. And as it relates to the Rainbow Disposal Company, that was just a really high-quality asset that was in an adjacent market to where we already were, and we felt that, one, that the assets were great and the management team there was outstanding, and some of their infrastructure can actually benefit us going forward in the surrounding market. So we're going to continue on the same pace. So I know I said this earlier, but I'd say it again. It makes sense for staying focused on tuck-ins in around that $100 million pace, and then it makes sense for us to look at other opportunities and when they're available and we can get good-quality assets with the right price to take advantage of that just like we did with Rainbow. So we'll continue to take that stance going forward.","Operator","Next is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel.","Michael Edward Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Housekeeping question for all of us, if you would. What's implicit in your earnings guidance for a tax rate?","Charles F. Serianni","We're not -- Michael, this is Chuck. We're not giving that level of guidance right now. Obviously, we'll get into a lot more details when we give full guidance in February. Just keep in mind that our rate in 2014 is 39.5%.","Michael Edward Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","And there's no reason that's going to change, right?","Charles F. Serianni","Yes. We'll give more guidance in February.","Michael Edward Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. For whatever it's worth, guys, some of that kind of knowledge would be helpful. Well that doesn't get into real guidance. So you've got to have some assumptions in it. Year-over-year, 4Q, you're going to have about a 200-basis-point margin difference. Are there -- what are the onetime, nonrecurring that we should be aware of?","Donald W. Slager","Michael, we didn't give Q4 margin guidance, though.","Michael Edward Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Well, it's implicit in your full year guidance.","Donald W. Slager","Right now, we're saying that year-to-date, they were at 28.1% on our EBITDA guidance.","Michael Edward Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Right. And a year ago, you were 30.3%.","Charles F. Serianni","Right. We called out some of the factors that were included in our year-to-date numbers, including commodities, weather and insurance, when you adjust for that, we're writing the range of the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. So...","Michael Edward Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So that's the point. Those numbers are in the fourth quarter as well. That's what I was trying to get at. It was of last year. We got the same call-outs there.","Charles F. Serianni","Yes. And remember, Michael, in the last year, in the fourth quarter, which we had called out that we did benefit from some favorable environmental adjustments that were more prior-year items, which brought the margin up above our original expectations. So again, when you kind of take a look at what we've expected for this year, we knew that those things would anniversary out.","Michael Edward Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Right. That's what I was trying to get at. And then, Don, you have talked about in the past, you did share the $200 million in CapEx spread over 5 years, but you also talked about 75 basis points spread out over 3 or 4 years of improvement as a result from automation productivity CNG One Fleet, how do you feel about that today?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. So look, we're getting the benefits from automation on the productivity side. We're getting benefits from CNG on the fuel side. The maintenance benefits are coming a little harder than that. As I said earlier, the One Fleet initiative is the right thing to do. It's coming a little slower than we'd like, and it's costing us a little more in this quarter, and in the remaining quarter of the year than we may be expected. We also have some other things going on in there. So again, as you know, Michael, I mean, there's a lot of mix in this business. You've got a lot of geographical mix. You've got a lot of line of business mix. There's a lot of puts and takes. And the one thing we found as we've dug deeper into the maintenance initiative is fleet complexity. So these emission standards from the '08 and '10 and '14 engines are driving cost up on those trucks. We really weren't anticipating that when we went down the road with One Fleet. And -- but the fact is we're probably spending more time than any company out there really understanding our fleet dynamics and try to drive fleet cost out and anniversary-ing some of these costs. But there are some things like that, that are masking it. The fact that the CPI resets in the resi business, where again most of our automated fleet is working, that has not helped us. So we're committed to those initiatives. We're going to continue to roll them out and see them through. And there will be a day when we anniversary some of this bio-wave [ph] cost in maintenance, and it'll flat line and then we'll have the benefits throughout other parts of the business.","Operator","Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.","Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So in reviewing your residential contracts, we've talked at length about the challenges CPI-based pricing on the solid waste side, but can you comment a little bit about the profitability of your residential recycling programs now that commodity prices are kind of holding at these relatively low levels. How are you looking to improve this part of your residential business as well?","Donald W. Slager","Well, Barbara, the review that we're doing with our all of our residential contracts include recycling as well. So we're constantly looking at improving the recycling line of business through making it more efficient at our sorting facilities. Part of what we're doing through collection methodology by getting efficiencies there. And when we do look at residential -- or I'm sorry, recycling contracts, we tend to look at sort of 10- to 15-year returns in average using sort of an average market price. So they're not performing as well as we'd hoped, but again, all things are cyclical. So we're using all the learnings that we're putting into this now to bid new contracts and we will just get better through time. But the -- it's not the recycling part of the residential business that's dragging us down. It's the overall CPI environment for, again, in that line of business that's almost 30% of our total collection business. So it's a big chunk of our business that is weighing down the other components of the business that are actually operating pretty well.","Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Sure, got you. Do you guys have any leeway to put forth a processing fee or something like that? I know some other competitors in the industry have been talking about this.","Donald W. Slager","Well, things like contamination and performance criteria sort of a normal part of these contracts. So we do our best to hold anybody who is delivering material or producing material for these contracts to their end of the bargain. So it's -- you can't just break a contract in the middle of a contract and introduce new features or new penalties. If they're not in there generally at the beginning, you don't get to pull those triggers, and that's the issue with municipal buyers. They like to have a fixed-price, month-to-month throughout the course of the contract and only onetime a year do they want to open it up to some kind of a standardized index that you don't have to argue about, and that's the way they've walked for decades. And that's probably not going to change much except for the fact that we can get them focused on a different type of index that's more fair to a waste hauler like Republic Services. And overtime, just continue to move through that book of business and improve it.","Operator","Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions today.

Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our first quarter results and are proud of the way the Republic team responded to challenging winter conditions. Even though we lost approximately 3% of our route days in the central and east regions due to weather, we reported positive volume growth, positive yield in all lines of business, and generated strong cash flow to fund substantial cash returns to shareholders.","Some of the financial highlights for the quarter include first quarter EPS was $0.43. Excluding the weather impact, adjusted EPS would have been $0.45. About half of the $0.02 weather impact was due to lost revenue opportunities and the remainder was due to increased operating costs.","Adjusted free cash flow was $186 million, and it was in line with our expectations. This level of performance continues to demonstrate the strong cash flow characteristics of our business. Core price in the first quarter was 3.2% and average yield was 1.2%. Average yield was comparable to the first quarter of the prior year, even with a 110 basis point decline in CPI-based pricing. We continue to see strong core price contribution from the open market to offset lower CPI-based price resets. ","First quarter volumes increased 1.5%. Volume growth was concentrated due to C&D roll off, national accounts, and landfill special waste. Commercial service level changes were positive in the first quarter and increased sequentially. This is a continuation of a trend that began in 2013.","We returned $226 million to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends. This includes 3.9 million shares repurchased for $132 million. We still expect to spend approximately $400 million on share repurchases in 2014.","During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our multiyear initiatives that enabled us to execute our strategy. We are focused on managing the controllable aspects of our business by improving the quality of revenue, investing in profitable growth opportunities, and reducing costs.","For example, during the first quarter, we launched My Resource, a customer portal that gives our customers online access to their accounts and our services. This expanded technology enhances our customers\u2019 experience by making it easier to do business with us. These capabilities further differentiate our service offering and increase value to our customers. ","We continue to improve service quality by consistently delivering on the promises we make to our customers. The goal is to build customer loyalty and improve customer retention. We grade ourselves using Net Promoter Score, or NPS, which measures the willingness of our customers to recommend our services. Our Net Promoter Scores have improved in five consecutive quarters.","The investment made in acquisitions was $11 million. We acquired approximately $7 million of revenue at a post-synergy EBITDA multiple of 4.5x. These transactions consist of tuck-in acquisitions that layer in well to markets we already service. At the end of the quarter, we had $18 million of deals under letter of intent.","12% of our fleet is currently operating on natural gas. We expect that 14% of the fleet will be operating on natural gas by the end of the year. 57% of our residential fleet is now automated. 47% of our fleet has completed our One Fleet maintenance initiative. We remain confident that we can cost-effectively extend the use of our fleet by one year once the majority of our vehicles have been certified.","We estimate that this will reduce future capital requirements by $200 million, spread over a 4 to 5 year period, beginning in 2015. Our initiatives remain on track, and we plan to launch other initiatives over the next several quarters, including the next generation of our ROI based pricing tool.","I\u2019m proud of our achievements during the first quarter, and remain encouraged by the underlying strength of the business. I want to thank the entire Republic team for their hard work and execution. Glenn and Ed will now discuss the financial performance. Glenn? ","Glenn Culpepper","Thanks, Don. First quarter 2014 revenue was approximately $2.1 billion, an increase of $75 million from the prior year. This 3.8% increase in revenue includes acquisitions of 60 basis points and reflects the following three components of internal growth: pricing, volume, and recycled commodities.","First, pricing. We had an average yield growth of 1.2%. First quarter average yield was consistent with the same period in the prior year, and in line with our expectations. Core price in the first quarter was 3.2%. ","Average yield in the collection business was 1.3%, which includes 2.7% yield in the industrial business and 1.2% yield in the commercial business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.4%, led by landfill and MSW, which increased approximately 2%. ","Fuel recovery fees increased 0.1%. Fuel costs increased approximately $2 million compared to the prior year, and decreased 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $3.96 in the first quarter from $4.03 in the past year, a decrease of approximately 1.7%. The current average diesel price is approximately $3.95 per gallon. ","Second, volumes increased 1.5% year over year. The collection business was positive 1.1%, primarily due to an increase in industrial volume. Growth in the industrial line of business was 3.1%, which includes C&D and other temporary activity, which was up approximately 6%.","Growth in the commercial business continues to be positive, but modest at 1.1%. Collection volume also includes a 50 basis point decline in the residential business, primarily due to contracts lost in bid situations. We will only renew business if it meets our return criteria.","The post-collection business consisting of third-party landfill and transfer station volume was positive 1.8%, which includes an increase in landfill special waste of approximately 14%. Special waste landfill volumes were lower in the first quarter of 2013, which created an easier comparison. Our landfill MSW volumes were down 1.6%. Our defection rate, which represents the annualized rate of customer turnover, remains stable at approximately 7%. ","Third, commodity revenue increased 40 basis points. The increase in commodity sales reflects both higher prices for recycled commodities and an increase in tons sold. Commodity prices increased 4.4% to an average price of $117 per ton in the first quarter from $112 per ton in the past year. This represents the average price for all commodity types across all regions.","First quarter recycling facility volume of 558,000 tons was up 3.6% from the prior year. Most of the increase relates to additional national accounts brokered volumes. We closed five older recycling centers that we no longer operate or that were consolidated into other facilities. ","We intentionally rationalized recycling assets that did not meet our return criteria. Current average commodity prices are approximately $113 per ton. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased $12 million compared to the prior year, an increase of 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue. ","Most of the change relates to brokering recycled commodity volumes on behalf of our national accounts customers. The return on this business is attractive, since there are limited capital requirements. ","Now I will discuss year over year margin. First quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7%, compared to 28.5% in the prior year, a decrease of 80 basis points. As Don mentioned, our business was impacted by the severe weather conditions in the first quarter, which reduced EBITDA margin performance by approximately 30 basis points. The margin impact mostly relates to an increase in operating costs, including labor, fuel, and utilities incurred as a result of weather. ","Additionally, we benefited from alternative fuel tax credits of approximately $6 million in the prior year. As we discussed on our last earnings call in February, this credit expired, which resulted in a 30 basis point EBITDA margin headwind in the first quarter of 2014. These margin headwinds are isolated to our first quarter performance. ","During the first quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of approximately $36 million or $0.06 of EPS related to an increase in estimated remediation costs at Bridgeton Landfill. During the quarter, it became necessary to upgrade the design and capacity of the [unintelligible] Treatment Facility, which will increase total construction costs. The impact of this charge was excluded from adjusted EPS in the first quarter and our expected adjusted EPS for the full year. ","Ed will now discuss interest expense, free cash flow, and selected balance sheet data.","Edward Lang","Thanks, Glenn. First quarter 2014 interest expense was $87 million, which included $11 million of noncash amortization. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 39.8% of adjusted earnings, and in line with our expectations. Our effective tax rate of 33.4% in Q1 of the prior year was favorably impacted by closing our open tax years under audit.","The change in tax rate was expected, but resulted in a $0.05 EPS headwind compared to our prior year performance. First quarter 2014 adjusted free cash flow was $186 million, which was in line with our expectations. Net capital expenditures during the quarter were $213 million.","At March 31, our accounts receivable balance was $873 million, and our days sales outstanding was 38 days or 25 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7 billion at March 31, and excess availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.5 billion.","I will now turn the call back to Don.","Donald Slager ","","Thanks, Ed. To conclude, our first quarter results keep us on track to achieve the goals and objectives we established for 2014, and we remain comfortable with our full year guidance. The fundamentals of the business remain strong, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of an improving economy. ","We built our plan assuming the positive momentum exiting 2013 would continue, and we believe underlying business conditions are improving as expected. We remain focused on managing the business for the long term and creating lasting shareholder value. ","Our team remains dedicated to providing superior customer service and executing our strategy to deliver consistent earnings and cash flow growth. We are committed to an efficient capital structure, maintaining our investment grade rating, and increasing cash returns to shareholders.","Before going to Q&A, I would like to personally congratulate three Republic employees for being selected as this year\u2019s drivers of the year by the National Waste and Recycling Association. The three drivers are being honored for their outstanding customer service and safety records and were chosen out of 908 nominations from across the U.S.","As this award is our industry\u2019s highest honor, I\u2019m proud that once again Republic secured all three of the coveted award categories. Congratulations Tino, [unintelligible], and Johnny. We look forward to celebrating your achievements with you next week at Waste Expo.","At this time, operator, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your final question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse ","Just a question on volumes. Maybe you could give us a sense of any early read you have into seasonality. Are we going to see above normal seasonality based on what you\u2019re seeing in volumes today? I realize it may be a little too early. And then by the same token, maybe you could touch on how much landfill volumes were up as well, if I missed that.","Donald Slager ","I will tell you that Q2 we\u2019re off to a really good start in April, looking at a continuation of what we saw with specifically roll off C&D and special waste has been strong for us. So again, to your point, it is a little bit too early to judge seasonality. We usually like to have May under our belt before we can start to judge that. But we\u2019re off to a good start in April.","As far as landfill volume overall, we had a strong C&D and MSW, but total landfill volume was plus 4%. But special waste led the way, as Glenn said, up about 14%. So we lost some MSW volume. We\u2019ve had some competitive losses, so about 1.6% decline over last year in trash coming into landfills based on competitive pricing.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse ","And just a follow up question. I think you\u2019re less than 3x net debt to EBITDA levered. There are a lot of larger assets out there that are private. I know historically you\u2019ve spoken about this steady $100 million tuck-in sort of acquisition diet. Could you maybe just comment on how comfortable you are in taking leverage up? I know we did that in the Republic-Allied deal. How comfortable are you in taking leverage up to what level to do something larger that makes sense?","Donald Slager ","Well, we\u2019ve always said I think our sweet spot is between 2.5x and 3x. So we\u2019d like to keep it there. We\u2019re right now at 3x. We do look at larger deals, and right now we are focused and have been on the small tuck-ins, because they come at the right multiple post-synergy and they also have less risk as far as integration goes. ","We do look at larger transactions, and we do have flexibility in our balance sheet to do things, whether we can do that using our revolver or if we had to flex the stock repurchase. We\u2019re just looking at it from what\u2019s accretive and what brings us the best returns. ","So if you look at our stock trading at 8.5, for us it kind of comes down to that. Would we rather spend 8.5x EBITDA buying into a company we know and love, that is Republic? Or do we want to put that money at risk? And we certainly aren\u2019t going to be paying 9x or 9.5x for EBITDA. ","So if we can buy good free cash flow at the right multiple, we\u2019re going to do that, and we\u2019re going to consistently look at larger deals. And they do come across our radar every now and then, but we\u2019ve got to be disciplined in our purchasing strategy. ","Glenn Culpepper ","And the limit on our credit facility as far as the covenant test is debt to EBITDA of 3.5x, so again, we\u2019re an investment grade credit. Our credit metrics are consistent with that type of a credit rating, and the credit facility does have a limit in debt to EBITDA in order to ensure that type of a rating.","Operator","The next question that I show comes from Derek Sbrogna with Macquarie. ","Derek Sbrogna - Macquarie","Just wanted to drill in a little bit here on the weather. The $0.02 impact, can you maybe talk a little bit more about where you see the lost revenue opportunities and also I know you framed out the three areas where costs have increased. If you could maybe provide some additional color on why those costs go up in poorer weather?","Donald Slager ","Well, weather specifically. We had some really severe weather in parts of the country that we normally budget weather in, places like Chicago and Detroit. But this was pretty harsh weather if you live there. We had brutal cold and we had snow day on day. And then we saw weather in parts of the country we don\u2019t normally budget for weather. We don\u2019t budget for snow in Atlanta and places like that.","So when you have weather like that, we have two things happen. We have loss of revenue from garbage not moving to our landfills or us not hauling roll off loads from businesses that aren\u2019t operating. You have some pickup from the fact that some days you don\u2019t run your trucks. But then when you have to come back and pick up where you left off and make up for that lost time, you\u2019re paying a lot of overtime. ","And you have frankly, in some of the really brutal weather, things tend to break when it\u2019s subzero for many days in a row. You know, steel gets brittle and your maintenance costs go up, those kind of things. ","So again, I know we\u2019re not the only company out there beyond the waste industry that\u2019s had to talk about weather, and so we\u2019re not using that as an excuse. We just wanted to point it out, that we did have some impact. And frankly, a solid $0.02 from a half cost and half revenue loss, but I think that frames out the fact that we\u2019re really positive on the underlying fundamentals of the business units and as to the question I answered from Hamzah, we\u2019ve got a good start here in April, and we think the underlying fundamentals are strong.","Operator","And maybe just one more. You\u2019ve seen a couple of consecutive quarters here of the strength in specialty waste. I know that there\u2019s been some easier comps, and maybe that business can be lumpy. But can you talk about the environment you\u2019re seeing in those markets and whether some of the pickup is really indicative of you guys winning business, or whether it\u2019s just indicative of a strengthening environment.","Donald Slager ","I would say it\u2019s new volume. We talk about how our business tends to lag the economy, both on the downside and the return. And we would tell you that as we see special waste volumes returning, it is an indicative sign of better economy to come. When companies are releasing bids for special waste cleanups, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve got confidence in their own capital budgets.","And a lot of times, the special waste is land clearing for new construction, so that bodes well for what\u2019s to come. So we\u2019ve got a strong market in special waste and C&D, and we\u2019re just waiting for that to lead the way for a stronger return in commercial.","Operator","Next is from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. ","Corey Greendale - First Analysis","First, a question on the brokered recycling volume. I understand that that\u2019s [unintelligible] because of slow capex, but it is suppressing EBITDA margins, so it would be helpful to understand just what is happening without that in it. The 50 basis point decrease that I think Glenn talked about from that particular [unintelligible], is that the right way to think about this, that EBITDA margin would have been 50 basis points higher if it weren\u2019t for the growth in that business?","Donald Slager ","The national accounts brokered volumes would account for a 30 basis point decrease in our margins in the quarter. And the reason for it really is we\u2019re required to book the full amount of the revenue and the full amount of the costs, even though in many cases we\u2019re not even handling the product. And so it\u2019s really just a pass through, but we have to record both the revenues and the costs gross.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis ","And I know the dynamic kind of contrasting internal growth components, you versus Waste, there\u2019s nothing new, but because it was almost the sole focus of Waste\u2019s call earlier, I just want to ask. The fact that you\u2019re reporting better volume and lower on yield than Waste Management, how much do you attribute that to philosophy versus the markets you\u2019re in and do you expect that to change with this next generation ROI pricing tool that you\u2019re talking about?","Donald Slager ","That\u2019s a big question, so I\u2019ll give you some color. One, we don\u2019t focus primarily just on yield metric. There\u2019s a lot more to consider when you think about where you want to grow your business and how you want to balance price and volume. So we\u2019re trying to give both positive price and volume in our business, and of course we\u2019re focused on return on invested capital.","So when it comes to where we\u2019ll walk away from business, we want to walk away from business when it\u2019s not profitable, when it doesn\u2019t give us an appropriate return. We want to retain business that gives us the appropriate return, even if it is a competitive bidding type of a situation. ","So we take two very different views. One in the post-collection business. We have consistently raised prices in the landfill business, and consistently let volume go that didn\u2019t meet our pricing expectations. Those landfills are expensive to own and operate, and we feel that they should carry a higher price component of growth every year. So as I said, we actually saw more defection in our landfill business in Q1, 1.6% volume loss, and all that volume loss because they found a better price somewhere else.","So a little different view in the hauling side, as I said. In our commercial business, that density really matters, and it\u2019s a very profitable part of our business. So when we\u2019re in a competitive situation over a current customer, we\u2019re going to try to keep that customer if it\u2019s profitable and has the right return. ","Now, we\u2019re growing our rollup business, because that part of the business is starting to come back. And while some might argue that that part of the business has a lower return than other parts of the business, the fact is our job is to grow free cash flow and deploy capital at the appropriate terms. So we\u2019re growing that business, and we\u2019re getting both price and volume in the rollup system. So we\u2019re seeing margins expand because of the demand. ","So we think our team\u2019s doing a good job of balancing both price and volume. Remember that we\u2019ve got 7% defection in our business, so if we do nothing, our business shrinks 7% a year. And so we\u2019ve got to replace that volume. About half of that 7% is competitive. ","The other half is structural, but we\u2019ve got to replace that volume to stay flat. In fact, you\u2019ve got to replace that volume plus, in order to stay flat, because we\u2019ve had this conversation probably a number of times, Corey. If you\u2019re losing business for competitive price, you\u2019re losing it at a higher than average price, and if you\u2019re gaining business at market prices, it\u2019s generally coming in slightly below.","So another thing to point out is I think our pricing\u2019s pretty strong. We have 3.2% core price, and that includes 4.2% in the open market. So we\u2019re out there pricing pretty consistently in the open market every month. And as you know, we really control that pricing movement from a corporate office, our pricing team working with the local divisions, pushing out those pricing programs month after month. You know, every market about a 12th of the market every month that we\u2019re reviewing customer cost and pricing and passing that into the market.","So I think we\u2019re doing a good job. The think you mentioned about the new pricing tool, what that\u2019s going to do for us, it\u2019s a technology solution, frankly, that brings some better control and user friendliness to our frontline sales people so that we\u2019re going to try to work harder to control that point of sale pricing and help those sales people make better decisions at the front end.","So a lot of the things that we\u2019re doing at Republic are focused in and around improving yield. And I would say it more improving the quality of revenue, and improving the decision making about how we quote business and how we prove to the customer that our value proposition is better.","I spoke in my comments about customer service, about launching the user portal, the thing we call My Resource. So whatever we can do around here to improve that quality of revenue, that quality of the product to the customer, increase their willingness to pay, that\u2019s where we\u2019re living and breathing here. ","But we believe that you\u2019ve got to balance that volume and price growth. As long as you\u2019ve got a keen eye in and around a returns-based philosophy, we think it\u2019s the right thing to do for cash and ultimately for long term returns in the business. ","Operator","Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets, your line is open. ","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Don, it sounds like you guys are getting pretty close to getting over the hump on One Fleet, at about 47% installed. I think comps get a bit easier in Q2 on the maintenance and repair side. Are you still thinking that mid to late 2014, One Fleet starts to pay for itself?","Donald Slager ","Yeah, when half the fleet is certified and no longer causing that cost [unintelligible] wave, we\u2019ll start seeing more and more benefits from the first half of the fleet. Again, improved productivity, less downtime, better customer service, driver engagement scores improve in the business. So we\u2019re still positive about the process.","Again, this is a really big change initiative as we\u2019ve talked about, and it\u2019s kind of slow going, but the deeper we get into it, the more committed we are to it. It\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s going to pay us back. And then of course over and above that, just running a better business, having a stronger operation and a better customer service reliability, we\u2019re going to have that reduced capex over the long term. So we\u2019re committed to getting more out of our fleet and beginning to reduce capex in 2015 by $40 to $50 million a year over a four or five year period.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","No, I certainly get the benefits of it. Maybe just to dig into the numbers a little bit, and I get that Q1 maintenance and repair expenses probably were somewhat inflated by weather, but should we start to think about that year over year increase in maintenance from repair leveling off? Or even declining on a year over year basis?","Donald Slager ","Well, we\u2019ll just try to put it into the context of this. The three initiatives that we\u2019ve got going on in our cost and productivity are One Fleet, our C&D and our automation. They\u2019re worth about 100 basis points over a three-year period. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019d have you look at it, and we\u2019re going to have better science around this as we get into it, and ultimately we\u2019re going to get really good at understanding the efficient frontier of our fleet and tweaking our maintenance even further. But more of our stand today is that 1% across those three initiatives of operating costs over a three-year period.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets ","I just want to as one very high level question for you. It seems like there\u2019s been several states out there that have added recycling mandates recent, which I guess I find it a bit interesting, because at the same time you have waste firms like yourself that are pushing back and even rationalizing some recycling assets.","So I guess what would you tell us? How should we think about reconciling the difference between what customers are saying versus what vendors are doing right now. It just seems like you guys are kind of moving in opposite directions.","Donald Slager ","I guess start with we don\u2019t think recycling is going away. We think it\u2019s core to our business and we recognize the customer demand. At the same time, we\u2019re in the business to turn a profit, and we need to expand our business services to meet customer needs as long as they bring the appropriate return.","So again, Glenn mentioned that we\u2019ve rationalized a couple of assets. We closed a couple of facilities, because they weren\u2019t bringing us the proper return. It really is a market by market basis. So we\u2019ve got 240 markets across our 40 states. California is not going to change. They\u2019re going to continue to have very strong recycling goals, and they\u2019ve got teeth in those goals. Consequently, they\u2019ve also got a lot of money to spend in education and the recycling is much more a part of the social conscience there. There are other states that are similar to that. ","There are some states that have increased their goals, but they really haven\u2019t put any teeth around that. It comes down to regulation, it comes down to density, participation rates, and ultimately for us it\u2019s got to come down to, can we create a decent return? ","And in some markets, we think we\u2019ll be able to have a good return on recycling. In other markets, we won\u2019t. And consequently, we won\u2019t do it or we\u2019ll do it through a third party. In some cases, we have a network of third parties that we use their facilities and so forth, because we don\u2019t want to make that investment just yet.","So we\u2019re just taking a very disciplined approach. I think it\u2019s a slow mover. It\u2019s probably moving a little quicker than it was 10 years ago, but I think our approach has been pretty rational. It seems that the industry seems rational today, and there have been some companies that grew from nothing in recycling over the years, but they don\u2019t tend to stick around very long. We look at this thing over the 10 year cycle, so when we make those investments we look at what are these commodities worth over the long term. ","Operator","Next comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs ","A couple of questions. On the volume side, looking at your key geographies and the parts of the country where you weren\u2019t impacted by weather as much, was there a notable difference in volume trends there relative to the northeast\/southeast during the quarter?","Donald Slager ","I think we had pretty good volumes kind of across the board, but the west did a great job for us. They didn\u2019t have weather. So our west region is Texas to California and up to Oregon\/Washington. So not a lot of weather impact. Good economic recovery. We\u2019ve got a very good landfill network in the west. A good special waste quarter for us there, and if we look at those underlying trends there, and that\u2019s what gives us a lot of confidence in just the overall fundamentals of the business. So as I said, weather is kind of out of the way now. April is starting off very strong, and we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence going forward. ","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs ","And then on the recycling side, there\u2019s been some volatility in the recycling paper commodity prices. They went up materially in March, and then we gave it back in April. Do you have any visibility into what recycled paper commodities will do over the next couple of months? Any thoughts around that?","Donald Slager ","I would just tell you flat. I wish I had a crystal ball, then I would know when to bet on the Bears again. But flat, I think, from our perspective.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs ","That\u2019s fair. And just a last one from me. Can you update us on the Southern California market with Puente Hills now being closed for more than six months? Anything incremental and interesting there?","Donald Slager ","We have the closest landfill in the heart of the market. Consequently, we have probably the highest price landfill in the market as far as our rates and our rates to customers. So when that landfill closed, a lot of that volume went to Orange County. They took the volume at a reduced rate, built a transfer station there at La Puente. And we did not really benefit from any volume and any volume that we would get would come at higher rates to sort of work within our current rate structure. We\u2019re not looking at discounting there in L.A. to attract cheap volume.","Operator","Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich, your line is open. ","Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich","Service intervals, you alluded that you were seeing positive service interval changes. And then you shared in several of your answers areas like the western region and the volume trends. It seems through the breadth of the call so far there\u2019s this sentiment of just fundamental volume improvement occurring. And no hockey sticks, but just an overall trend that\u2019s moving in the right direction. Is that how I\u2019m supposed to interpret some of the things you said? ","Donald Slager ","Yeah, I would say we\u2019re very positive. No hockey stick, that\u2019s important. Everyone would like to think that there\u2019s some inflection point, because everything\u2019s going to kind of happen at once. We don\u2019t see that happening. ","A lot of good momentum, albeit slow, we think, specifically for Republic. We\u2019re doing a lot of the right things. We\u2019re improving the core business, we\u2019re working on costs, we\u2019re working on our panel agenda, we\u2019re focused on the customer. We\u2019re doing a lot of good things to improve the business and the economy is responding better than it has in previous years. ","So a lot of good trends, and that\u2019s why I said we\u2019re comfortable in confirming our guidance. We\u2019re strong on the cash flow. We\u2019re buying back our stock. We\u2019re very positive on that, so all in all, we felt we had a really good quarter and we think we\u2019re going to finish the year right on track. ","Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich ","You have a 28.5% to 29% EBITDA guidance. So we\u2019re reaffirming that for full year 28.5% to 29%. So to do that, is your pricing covering inflation at this point? I\u2019m trying to figure that out. The price you report, are we covering inflation at this point? Your inflation.","Donald Slager ","Remember, we\u2019ve got to go out and get better price in the open market to do that. So I would tell you, we\u2019re comfortable with what\u2019s going on in our commercial open market business, our industrial business. Our residential business continues to be a drag for us. That\u2019s been a real low spot for us, the state municipal finance, the condition of those cities. ","We\u2019re taking a harder stand on some of these renewals. They want us to deploy more and more capital and if you look at some of these recent bids that have been on the Street, they want every kind of automation and every kind of recycling and the capital intensity is growing, but their willingness to pay is not.","So we\u2019re taking a different position there. So we\u2019re going to have to work a little harder to get the cost recovery out of those residential contracts that are only giving us 1.5% CPI. But you know, we\u2019re trying to make up for it in other parts of the business. So we do think the pricing environment is improving subtly, not CPI, necessarily, but the open market. And we\u2019re going to continue to try to improve the quality of our products and services to earn more from the customers. ","Michael Hoffman - Wunderlich ","And that translates into disposal pricing as well?","Donald Slager ","Well, yeah, I\u2019m not so sure how much more we can do to improve our quality in the landfills for disposal customers. I think it just comes down to what\u2019s available in the marketplace. And we\u2019ve consistently raised our prices at landfills, and we\u2019ve consistently lost volume at landfills. So that\u2019s okay with us, because we think those assets are so critical. ","So over time, I think as I said probably many times, as the general consumer sentiment improves, as general volumes improve, I think competition behavior improves, I think that speaks well to pricing overall, and hopefully disposal pricing as well.","Glenn Culpepper ","And Michael, remember we discussed in the call that we had 60 basis points of margin headwind in the first quarter that will not recur during the rest of the year. So essentially what we\u2019re looking at is, with the current low CPI environment, flat margin performance year over year when you look at \u201914 full year compared to 2013.","Operator","The next question comes from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. ","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities","Just to follow up on that, the 60 basis points of headwind, is that the remediation?","Glenn Culpepper ","No, that was the impact of weather. It was about 30 basis points. And in Q1 of 2013 we had a benefit of an alternative fuel tax credit which obviously goes through the fuel expense line. So the combination of those two items, the 60 basis points unique to the first quarter of this year and not rolling into the second quarter. ","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities ","And Don, just on this whole pricing dynamic, and I appreciate some of the comments and responses you\u2019ve had here, on the landfill side, realizing the market is local, are you suggesting or implying that you\u2019re on average having trouble - maybe that\u2019s the wrong word - raising price at the landfill because it is deflecting volume away? ","Donald Slager ","Well, we lost 1.6% volume in MSW at the landfill, and they were all pricing related losses. One specifically was a bid at a municipality, and others were individual customers. So we\u2019re going to continue to raise landfill prices. Again, landfills are expensive to own and operate. They need to be able to handle year on year price increases that cover those additional costs. And so we\u2019re going to continue to do that. ","We can\u2019t subsidize other people in the business by lowering landfill rates. Can\u2019t do that. And so that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve approached our infrastructure for many years and we\u2019re going to continue to do that.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities ","And then on the volume side, I\u2019m sorry, I joined the call a little late, the number was what it is in the first quarter, but the trend here is a little bit more headwind in the back half of the year or comps relative to the back half of 2013?","Glenn Culpepper ","Our guidance for the full year on volume was 1.5% to 2%, so I would say we\u2019re tracking right within our expectations.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities ","And then finally, it sounded like you said earlier that the open market pricing is trending up, not necessarily accelerating, but there\u2019s net improvement in the overall price environment?","Donald Slager ","Well, I think we expect it to continue to improve through the year. We\u2019ve relied, as we said at the beginning of the year, when we gave guidance, we\u2019re going to have to rely on the open market to carry a little bit more pricing than it did last year in light of the low CPI environment in the rest of our index business. And we think that\u2019s going to be the case. As I said, we\u2019ll get 4.2% core pricing in the open market as a component of that 3.2% core. So we\u2019re consistently out in the market looking to improve the quality of revenue. Some of those through pricing actions for existing customers as well as the pricing structure that we\u2019re using to bid on new business.","Operator","The next question comes from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli. ","Tony Bancroft - Gabelli","Quick question on any update with municipal contracts? I saw the news with the Los Angeles last week. Anything there as far as new trends or color there?","Donald Slager ","No. Are you talking about the City of L.A., on Puente?","Tony Bancroft - Gabelli","The Los Angeles contract, where they decided to break it up into I think 11\u2026","Donald Slager ","Yeah, they\u2019re going to franchise that. So we\u2019re involved in that process. There\u2019s a limited number of sections of the city that you\u2019re able to win. We\u2019re going to be a part of that process. We expect that because of our capability and the location of our landfill that we\u2019ll fare okay in that process. And it\u2019s a little ways away yet, but we\u2019re knee deep into it, and that\u2019s all I can report for now. But we\u2019ll keep you updated as we get a little further down the road.","Operator","And I am showing no further questions at this time.","Donald Slager ","All right, thank you, operator. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment, and dedication to operational excellence in creating the Republic Way.

When events are scheduled, the dates, time, and presentations are posted on our Web site.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.","Don Slager","Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased with our second quarter results, which clearly demonstrate the underlying strength of our business. During the quarter, we successfully priced in excess of our cost inflation, achieved EBITDA margin expansion of 50 basis points, and increased earnings per share by 8%. We expect the strong momentum in the first-half of the year to continue. As a result, we are reaffirming our original full-year EPS and free cash flow guidance provided, in February, despite continued declines in recycled commodity prices.","During the second quarter commodity markets continued to be challenged. We overcame these headwinds by focusing our efforts on things we can control, in particular, transitioning to a more durable, economically sustainable recycling business model. As you'll hear from Jon, we are making good progress and seeing results. For example, the revenue and EBITDA impact of lower recycled commodity prices in the second quarter was $8 million. Because of the team's relentless efforts we overcame this headwind and increased recycling revenue 6% versus the prior year. In the second quarter, we invested $129 million in acquisitions to further enhance our leading market position and drive growth in free cash flow.","Our currency pipeline continues to be strong. As a result, we now expect to invest approximately $550 million in acquisitions this year. We estimate these acquisitions net of divestitures will provide 125 to 150 basis points of top line revenue growth in 2019. During the quarter, we also continued our balanced approach of returning cash to shareholders. We returned $213 million through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, our Board approved an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend, in line with our 10-year dividend CAGR. The consistent growth in the dividend demonstrates the stability and predictability of our cash flow as well as our confidence in the future cash flow generation capabilities of our business.","Through the consistent execution of our profitable growth through differentiation strategy, we have created a solid foundation for our business. We are leveraging this foundation to deliver results and increased long-term shareholder value. Our second quarter results clearly demonstrate this. Next, turning to our people, in recent years our efforts to create an environment that attracts and retains the best talent have been recognized by reputable third parties such as Barron's, EpiSphere, and Glassdoor. Most recently, Republic Services was named to Forbes List of Best Employers for Women. I'd like to thank our team for their relentless efforts to create a more inclusive culture and an environment in which all individuals feel welcomed and valued.","Finally, we believe as we grow the business so does our potential to drive change and positively impact the environment and society overall. We know we can do more, and are raising the bar through our latest long-term sustainability goals which we announced last week. Through the pursuit and achievement of these goals we will further enhance the foundation of our business and continue to create long-term value for our employees, our customers, communities, and shareholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Jon to discuss our second quarter operating performance. Jon?","Jon Vander Ark","Thanks, Don. The pricing environment in the second quarter remained strong. Total core price was 4.6%, and average yield was 2.8%. Core price included open market pricing of 5.5%, and restricted pricing of 3.1%. Our pricing continues to benefit from the use of our tablet-based pricing tool. Through this tool we are monitoring price elasticity and adjusting accordingly.","Additionally, we are benefiting from the advancement of several other strategic initiatives. First, we continue to successfully convert customers from CPI-based pricing to a waste-related index or a fixed rate increase of 3% or greater. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and continue to run higher than CPI. We have now converted $715 million or 29% of our $2.5 billion CPI-based book of business.","Next, we regularly reassess our landfill pricing to ensure we are covering the total lifetime cost of managing the ways to accept. Third, we are proactively renegotiating our municipal recycling collection contracts. We are ensuring they reflect the true costs of recycling and include a more equitable risk sharing arrangement. We've now secured price increases from approximately 29% of our municipal recycling customers up from 21% in the first quarter and finally, we're increasing our customer's willingness to pay by providing superior service and leveraging technology to make it easier for them to do business with us.","Turning to volume, total volume in the second quarter increased 10 basis points versus the prior year. Underlying volume growth was 80 basis points after normalizing the impact of intentionally shutting certain volumes. This included work performed on behalf of brokers and non-regrettable contract losses in residential collection business.","During the quarter, recycled commodity prices continue to decline. Our average price per ton decreased 14% to $78 versus $91 in the prior year. This resulted in an approximately $8 million or $0.02 headwind versus the prior year. We offset the impact of lower commodity prices through additional pricing and increased recycling revenue in the second quarter by 6% versus the prior year. Our ability to increase revenue and overcome these headwinds demonstrates that we are transforming the recycling business into a more durable economically sustainable business model.","In our recycling processing business, we have now secured price increases on approximately 55% of our contracted volumes up from 34% in the first quarter. In our collections business as I mentioned earlier, we continue to proactively secure price increases and renegotiate our municipal contracts. Additionally in the collection open market, our recycling processing charge is enabling us to recover our processing costs and minimize volatility from changes in recycle commodity prices.","This change contributed to -\u2013 this charge contributed an additional 40 basis points of pricing not reflected in average yield. If included average yield would have been 3.2%. These results demonstrate that our customers do value recycling and are willing to pay for the service. Finally, our adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 27.9% and expanded 50 basis points versus the prior year. Strong pricing and solid cost controls enabled us to more than offset a 20 basis point headwind from lower recycled commodity prices. We saw good operating leverage in both labor and maintenance again this quarter. Both of these costs as a percentage of revenue decreased versus the prior period.","Labor expenses benefiting from our focus on process and running efficiencies as well as our efforts to increase employee engagement; turnover decrease versus the prior year for the second quarter in a row. Maintenance expense continues to benefit from our One Fleet standardized maintenance program. Today, approximately 90% of our work orders are scheduled. This enables us to take the reliability of our fleet to the next level and further improve our already high customer service delivery rate of 99.9%. By providing even better service to our customers, we can further enhance customer loyalty and increase willingness to pay.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail.","Chuck Serianni","Thanks, Jon. Second quarter revenue was approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of $88 million or 3.5% over the prior year. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong pricing across our collection, disposal and recycling processing businesses. Our revenue growth came in at an incremental EBITDA margin of over 40%.","SG&A expense as a percentage of total revenue was 10.1%. For the full-year, we continue to expect SG&A expense to be approximately 10.4% of revenue. During the quarter, we grew EBITDA dollars by 5% versus the prior year and expanded EBITDA margins by 50 basis points.","For the full-year, we continue to expect approximately 30 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in line with our original guidance. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $621 million, and in line with our expectations. Cash flow generation in the first-half of the year positions us well to achieve our original full-year guidance. At the end of the quarter, leverage was three times, and within our optimal range of 2.5 to 3 times. Interest expense in the second quarter was $99 million, and included $12 million of non-cash amortization.","In the second quarter, relative to our expectations, cash related expense was favorable by $0.01. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, and provided a $0.04 benefit. This was partially offset by a $0.03 cash related headwind from a non-cash charge of $12 million. For the full-year, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 23%, 100 basis points lower than our original guidance, and a non-cash charge of approximately $60 million, which is consistent with our original guidance. Finally, as Don mentioned, we are reaffirming our original full-year financial guidance provided in February, which included EPS of $3.23 to $3.28, and free cash flow of $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion.","We're assuming current economic conditions continue and recycled commodity prices remain at current levels of approximately $75 per ton for the remainder of the year. Relative to our original guidance, the decline in recycled commodity prices has created a headwind of approximately $50 million or $0.11 of earnings. We're offsetting these commodity headwinds primarily through strong pricing and solid cost management.","At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tyler Brown","Hey, good afternoon guys.","Don Slager","Hi, Tyler.","Tyler Brown","Hey, nice quarter. But Chuck, so I don\u2019t want to dwell on the guidance too much, but it seems like there's quite a bit of movement here. So like if we look at this from a high level, and let's say we started at the midpoint of 326, you're going to reduce that by some recycling prices, you add back some from incremental M&A, maybe you take away some because you're doing less of a buyback because of that M&A. And then maybe you're getting a few pennies back on the tax rate, but basically is that -- are those the moving pieces, and if I do all of that math is there really any change in the core trends is really my question?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, I think you got the component pieces, Tyler. I mean, you talked about the commodities being a little bit more of a headwind than we had originally anticipated. We continue to do good work in terms of recycling processing charges and improvements there. Certainly cost control has been a good story for us. The other thing is pricing. And pricing is coming in a little bit stronger than we had originally guided to. And we believe right now that that's going to continue for the rest of the year.","Tyler Brown","Okay. And then on the M&A side though, it sounds like you're raising the expectations there, that's correct, right?","Chuck Serianni","That's correct.","Tyler Brown","So that would be a positive. And then maybe you're taking some of the capital from buybacks to the M&A, is that correct?","Chuck Serianni","That's also correct.","Tyler Brown","Okay, so -- ","Chuck Serianni","And as you know, Tyler, and as we've said to you before especially when you're doing midyear type acquisitions you spend a little bit of money to get things integrated, so there's not a ton of bottom line benefit in the first year, but great rollover benefit in the next year, but there'll be some benefit, and as we said in the comments, surely going to drive some top line revenue growth from that as well.","Tyler Brown","Okay. And Don, so $550 million, if I go back to my notes, I mean that must be one of the strongest M&A years that we've seen in a long time maybe outside of the Tervita year, but what's really driving the strength there, are these chunkier deals or are they just a lot of small tuck-ins?","Don Slager","Well, there's a couple of chunky ones in there. Again, as we've always said to you, that one, we're going to remain opportunistic, right, we're going to remain flexible with our balance sheet and keep our debt and the leverage where it needs to be. We've got plenty of dry powder to do good deals at the right price. When it comes down to buying good cash flow, good consistent, reliable cash flow at the right multiple we'll do that in exchange of buying in the shares. So that's always been our model. But we don\u2019t overpay, we don\u2019t overspend. If you take a look at what's happening under the hood with our ROI we're driving in the right direction, so you can see that these investments are paying off in the long-run.","And so all things that are well within our footprint and our ability and our team's core competence, so it's all good stuff. And we're going to continue to do it. $550 million will be an outsized year compared to the years past. I think we started this year at $200 million, and then boosted it to $300 million, 400 million I guess pretty quickly. So yeah, $550 million is a good number for us, and we'll talk more about what we think the pipeline looks like when we see you in October, for next year.","Tyler Brown","Okay and then -- and so maybe my last one here, so Don, just a bigger picture question. So we saw the release around the 2030 sustainability goals, really appreciate all that.","Don Slager","You bet.","Tyler Brown","But I want to talk about two of the goals that were in there, that I surmise both have a sustainable and maybe a direct financial impact. So first, can you talk about some of the specific plans to cut the reportable injuries in half just particularly given that it's kind of hung around these levels the last few years despite your side loader adoption. And then secondly, your employment engagement scores, they have been flipping just a little bit, not a lot, but a little bit over the past couple of years. Can you talk about maybe why and then how you plan to get those up, but those two pieces\u2026","Don Slager","Well, sure. First of all, I think, look, when you look at what's happening just above and beyond just engagement, all the other sort of cultural impacts we're having, I think we're having a -- and Jon mentioned in his commentary a lower turnover now for the second quarter, right, or two quarters in a row. So it's continued focus. And I would tell you that having turnover that's flattish to down in this economy is a much bigger story than we probably mentioned on the call, right. So the combination of some of the fleet reliability stuff that Jon and the team have delivered on, the focus on safety, late leadership training, we've invested in frontline leadership training, we have all of our frontline supervisors coming through this building. And some of them now come through for the second time, but we're seeing really good trends develop underneath. And those trends have to continue. And again these things, this is sort of a long-term aspirational goal, but we're very confident. Let me have Jon add a few things.","Jon Vander Ark","Yes, so on the safety piece; I think technology is going to be a huge play for us. Cameras is the most immediate venture on that front, but then if you think longer-term and you compare commercial vehicles to passenger cars we are at the very early stages of a lot of technology that's already available in passenger cars, and pushing very hard our vendors to build that into the equipment going forward. And they all have that as their product roadmaps, and things like active safety lane assist, all those things will help us become safer. And then on engagement, we are rising -- our workforce are becoming digital mitas [ph] and that will be an increasing percentage of our workforce.","And as we put technology, and we don\u2019t think about that singularly, we think about making our customers lives better. We're also thinking about making our employees' lives better. And as we've done that, a lot of investments historically on the sales force we've seen that with engagements with them, they are more engaged, they are more connected, their lives are easier and better. And we think we're going to see the same thing in the operating side of the business as we roll more technology to that part of our workforce.","Tyler Brown","Okay, perfect. I know those are long-term goals, but I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Don Slager","You bet.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire","Hey, good afternoon everyone, and congrats on the progress on transforming the recycling business. Just a couple of questions, on the landfill side, the volume growth was really strong there at up about 6%, just wondering if there's any one-time kind of special waste benefits in there, anything kind of unusual you would call out in that solid growth there?","Don Slager","Yes, I think landfill has been very strong on both price and volume, so good sign of economy, and I think also good sign of our leadership in that area where we continue to raise prices on landfills. We know that these are expensive assets, hard to operate own, and we want to think about the total lifecycle of everything that we bring in and are pricing accordingly, and also seeing the volume growth associated with that. So, it's been a good story for us.","Chuck Serianni","Yes, there's nothing really there that's going to -- it's a tough comp from last year or for next year.","Don Slager","It's good solid across the board.","Brian Maguire","Okay, and then just sort of a little bit on the flip side, collection volume seemed like they - and I understand you're shedding some broker business, some of this is non-regrettable, but it seems like it flipped a little bit and continues to kind of underperform the industry a little bit, just any comments you have on general trends there outside of the broker business?","Don Slager","Well, no, I would say that there was one sizable loss - a customer loss in the quarter, a large national account with garbage that was just too heavy for the amount of price they wanted to pay, right. And so, that does happen. We're going to continue to again have non-regrettable losses, and so nothing unusual, nothing has changed with -- I think the market and nothing really changed with our strategy, it's just timing, it's a little bit lumpy from time to time.","Brian Maguire","Okay. And then just on the input costs. The one that seem like it ticked back up again was just some of the disposal costs and leachate. It's been kind of a problem for a lot of the industry. Just any color you can give on what - how those are trending into 3Q and the back-half of the year, as we expect sort of continued margin headwinds on leachate?","Don Slager","Yes, I think you're right on the landfill operator, particularly leachate. Listen, we suffer from weather and we've had a couple of wet seasons that doesn't come out of the landfill immediately, but it does over time. I think you'll see that trend, that cost, that trend move favorably going forward, and while we continue to maintain a pretty robust pricing environment.","Brian Maguire","Okay. I'll turn it over. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye","Thank you for taking the questions. Actually if I could just follow up on the previous question, so you got about $10 million, it looks like in price realization on the landfill and I'm just applying the yield growth to the landfill business. And the leachate costs also went up about $10 million. So obviously getting 1.7% yield is better than it had been in the past, but just a view of tightening disposal capacity, and these cost pressures, could this be an area where maybe you can push price a little bit more and we can going to see it tick up passed the 2% range?","Chuck Serianni","Well, let me take the high level and Jon give you some background. But if you look at the results in the quarter and you look at our landfill pricing trends and, you look at to your point, the ultimate long-term scarcity and difficulty of owning and operating landfill business. Yes there are, pricing has been trending up in landfill space. And certainly believe there is more room for pricing in landfill space. And then specifically to the cost of leachate, that's the kind of thing that you answer real cost that ultimately will pass back through to the market, and the market is willing to pay for it, because again these landfills are ultimately still few and far between. Jon?","Jon Vander Ark","Yes, let me add. There is a natural lag, right, the cost hit us immediately and we can't price immediately, where we price typically over 30, 60, 90-day environment, sometimes a little bit longer depending on the contract. We are raising our environmental recovery fee, because as we see cost increase, we are going to price ahead of that cost.","Noah Kaye","Okay. And roughly, how much does that add in that recovery fee?","Chuck Serianni","Well, that's going to be a future period thing that we've talked about. So standby, we'll talk about how that's impacting us in October, when we talk about future.","Noah Kaye","Okay.","Nicole Giandinoto","And the benefits of that are contemplated in the guidance.","Noah Kaye","Yes, and I don't want to take away from what you did in this quarter. I mean your price - your total price was ahead of your total operating cost inflation, which is impressive. And I think if we just look at some of these cost items, you held your maintenance flat year-over-year. And so I guess the question is, if that's really from one fleet, is this kind of level of holding the line on maintenance and some of these items sustainable, how should we think about that?","Don Slager","Well, think about some of the comments that Jon shared with you guys, schedule maintenance is now 90%. That means unscheduled maintenance is 10%. So reactive maintenance now is -- we only spend a certain or very small amount of our time on reactive maintenance. So think about what they need that downtime to drive satisfaction, the customer service, the safety and all the implications not to mention just fleet cost, right. So that\u2019s been a long road for us to roll out one fleet but we started on the other end of that where we were 20% scheduled, now we're break over our goal of 80%. So that has now become a durable process in the company, right. So that's ongoing. You were seeing some nice things about the price traction and the price consistently that we got don't overlook the fact that in the restricted market, we got over 3% price.","So the team's been long working at turning around that restricted book of business, which was kind of the bane of my existence for a couple of years, right. And now we've got that book performing at 3% price. So it just goes to show you the way this business works, it takes time to get these things up and running. They've got a long-term benefit, they do find their stride and we tell you we\u2019re going to do something, we're going to do it and we've got a couple of great examples here that all those things are coming to fruition.","Noah Kaye","Okay, excellent. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Feniger","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m just curious on the second-half, could you just give us anything in terms of how we should be thinking Q3 versus Q4. I mean you definitely got the operating leverage in the second quarter but margin in the first-half. First-half last year are still flat. So we're expecting some more leverage it seems like in the second-half, is there anything that kind of help pass through how should think about the third quarter versus the fourth quarter?","Don Slager","Yes, I think that we are expecting margin improvement in both the third and the fourth quarter but most of that's going to come through in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind also that in the fourth quarter of last year, the margins were a little bit lower there with 27.4%, so when we talk about that margin expansion for the second-half of the year. Like I said, a lot of that will come through Q4.","Michael Feniger","And Chuck just on the $550 million for acquisitions. How much is actually it\u2019s peaked into 2019. Clearly you must have some line of sight to be able to put that number out. How much is that is actually going to be baked and you think to 2019?","Chuck Serianni","Yes, in terms of the Op income you mean or in terms of the revenue. So it\u2019s going to have very little impact in terms of the margins. Obviously, it's going to improve the dollars but very little impact on the margins just because of the ramp-up time because of the time it takes to get the synergies out of those acquisitions. The true tailwind associated with those acquisitions will come in 2020.","Michael Feniger","Okay. And just lastly, I know it\u2019s splitting hairs but like average yield last quarter was the highest in a decade, it ticked down a little bit. How do we think about that that number in the back-half? I mean I know comps get a little tougher but how do we think about in the back-half. And why don't we include the processing fee, I think that was taking you above 3%. Is that just because that number is just a quarter is not sustainable, why don't we actually include that processing fee and some of the actual recycling within that number? Thank you.","Chuck Serianni","Yes, that processing fee actually fluctuates with the price of commodities. And so what we didn't want to do is introduce that volatility into our yield, right. In terms of the yield it does tick up and down a little bit. There's a little bit of volatility associated with it but as we think at the back-half of the year, we think it's going to be relatively consistent.","Don Slager","In yield there is always a little bit of a mix, right. There is some mix geographically, there's mix by line of business by market by market vertical. That's always the business, we are always going to have that. But remember you're always getting the benefit because we're in this pricing environment and we're in this pricing reset environment when it comes to pricing differently than CPI, and also now re-pricing the book of business around recycling. So you're going to have that running out ahead of you. In other words, we're going to have this rollover benefit as we re-price contracts now with better contract structure and terms that we negotiated last year, this first quarter and second quarter.","So as we keep anniversarying new quarters, that's going to kind start catching up. So you're going to have that benefit out in the future. And one more point in that. That's what's fair for customers, right, it's good for us because we don't have this crazy that we talk about that that's what's real and is fair to customers and it helps us sell that to customers, who is trying to still partner with them and doing what's right for the environment, something they can get their mind around.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeff Silber","Thanks so much. Excuse me, in your prepared remarks you pointed out that the incremental margins you got on the revenue growth I think were over 40%. You haven't seen those numbers in quite a while. I'm just curious how sustainable you think that is and where that might normalize over time. Thanks.","Don Slager","Okay, well, I'm not sure what that was. But look what we've told you for a long time that when the business is working sort of normally that we do bring in new business in and around that 40% margin, that's not new to us. Yes, it's been, it hasn't been that high lately but you've got a robust environment, right, so pricing strong, you've got consumer sentiment is good. Consumer spending is good. All these things point in the right direction, you've got job growth, you've got wage growth, all these things that that helped the price war. You've got certain amount of volume growth that helps drive pricing up. So we've got the tools deployed, when you first interest capture I mean years ago that, Jon?","Jon Vander Ark","Five.","Don Slager","Yes, so we have got five years now of integrating that and making that sort of the way we do business. The adoption rates are 100% right. So all of those things working in a good work, in a good environment and as a result we get. So as long as you have that kind of a backdrop, that's what we'll have.","Jeff Silber","Okay, great. That's helpful. And I know when we kind of look at the broader economy, you mentioned the consumer is very strong but we're not seeing those kind of numbers on the industrial side or the commercial side as much. I'm just curious from your exposure there. What are your customers telling you, are you seeing the kind of weakness that we're seeing in some of the broader economic indicators?","Don Slager","Well, we're seeing a little bit of softness in the Midwest in the Great Lakes and some of those areas, we're still seeing strong economies of East and West. So we've got a lot of good in case we look at special waste strong. We think that's a great indicator of future projects, we see again more service increases and decreases, there's a lot of good data in our system that we track that still paints a pretty positive future and when there's a little softness here or there, that could be related to a number of things. But we're not too concerned about that right now.","Jeff Silber","All right. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael Hoffman","Hey, thank you very much. I just want to make sure that point of clarity here. I mean you had 3.2% price increase yield in the landfill side of MSW which is where the bulk of the leachate gets generated, that's expensive. So that's more than covering which you need to do and from the margin leverage of that all the way through the revenues and inflation and you're getting pricing leverage on the part of the business that has the worst part of the leverage from leachate?","Don Slager","Yes, so we're getting leverage on that piece of the business, Michael. You\u2019re right about that. But we need to get leverage on the entire landfill book. And as Jon mentioned, the leachate costs continue to rise and we need to make sure that we're getting an appropriate return on that entire asset. So there's still some work to do there.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. On the revenues, the $550 million that you want to spend, you spent $180 million in the first-half, that means $370 million, when you gave the number in the beginning Don. And I'm going to ask you if you'd repeat it. We didn't write it down fast enough. What are you assuming in the current outlook that that converts to and booked revenues in 2019?","Don Slager","Yes, 1.25% to 1.5% top line.","Michael Hoffman","Top line and that and you've spent the whole $550 million, can you tell that or okay.","Nicole Giandinoto","We did the remainder over the second-half.","Don Slager","Yes, we haven\u2019t spent it all yet but we'll spend it.","Michael Hoffman","But the assumption in the 1.25%, 1.5% is the whole $550 million spend?","Don Slager","Yes, right. So we'll give a free type system here on deals in pipeline deals and process deals under contract. So we got pretty idea where we are. So high level of confidence in that number, we wouldn't give it to you.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. And no, no I get that. I just wanted to understand. So what do you think the rollover into 2020 for acquisition on January 1, you have in hand was contributing related to the acquisition?","Nicole Giandinoto","I would say because the incremental growth on that is 50% that would roll in because if you think of the $550 million we're about halfway through that. So we have half of that contribution to top line growth rollover.","Don Slager","We're talking revenue. We're not giving you guidance on margin and yes that comes in there.","Michael Hoffman","No, no just trying to understand, what the revenue rollover is, yes just trying to understand what the revenue rollover is.","Don Slager","And this was my point earlier, right. I mean especially when we're having kind of robust second-half M&A activity, really nice rollover into next year, right. That\u2019s a good thing to have.","Michael Hoffman","And with it comes operating leverage on that rollover. So it excludes the momentum, so that is the point of this. Okay.","Don Slager","Thank you very much.","Michael Hoffman","All right. And then it\u2019s all solid waste?","Don Slager","It\u2019s not all solid waste. It's all waste, it\u2019s all environmental service, it's all the industrial waste, it's all stuff that we kind of do now and stuff that we're good at and it's all within our capability set, we spent a lot of money this year on some things around E&P in environmental industrial stuff. So it's a basket of things, right, but nothing, nothing outside what I would call our core capability.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. And at Expo, Brian offered up that you were looking at industrial liquids as an opportunity because basically you have a skill set there. Can you do somewhat leachate processing, so that that would fit into that bill as well that you might find?","Don Slager","Yes, look I mean here is the thing, right. When no different than when we first introduced to the fact that we were going to invest in that right now. Our timing was in the best on that deal but it turned out to be pretty nice for us. It's delivered good returns for us. And what I told already then was, look, this is about what's it about transportation, it's trucking, it's material handling, it's disposal, it's engineering, it's land management, it's landfill expansion, it's environmental service, it's all the kind of thing we do. We take in that business, we learn everything we need to know about it, we've expanded, we've made it a better business and then what happens is that opens you up to some additional capability, right.","So we're not going to go very far from what we do well because that does make sense. So we're slowly looking at other opportunities the one you mentioned is an opportunity in the space, right. So just like I always about M&A in solid waste, we look at everything. We take a look at how it lays over our capability and our footprint. And then we look at the cash returns and we compare the cash returns of that M&A and our capability to run it against the returns on buying back our stock. And it's kind of that simple but just like we did a great job with Tervita, just like we're doing a great job turning the recycling business around. We've got capacity beyond just dumping two yards and four yards, right, really good that by the way.","Michael Hoffman","Got it. Yep, you are pretty good at it. Last question from me, based on all if the commodities all stay right where they are and all the things you're doing will you on a run rate basis fully offset all of the headwinds including the first-half incremental headwind going into next year that you'll get, I don't, we don't have to talk about recycling if the commodity stay right here as far as headwind?","Nicole Giandinoto","Well, what I say, Michael, just to clarify, so in 2019 all of the year-over-year commodity headwinds that we're experiencing were more than offsetting through pricing. So we\u2019re improving the profitability of the recycling business overall. If you know as far as 2020 goes, we'll talk about that more in October.","Don Slager","But having said that, if you listen, if you reread the prepared remarks, we're making progress on every front, in fact we\u2019re making progress on moving those contracts de risking and recycling is many fast food business but we're making progress on every fronts of recycling. So we are on a path, right, not only to sort of ultimate overcome a deficit we've created for ourselves but we're on a path to the de-risk the business to a point where we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about it anymore, right. We're going to grow it, we may shrinking a little bit here and there, to grow it, but we're going to, we're going to be able to grow it and run it and do a great job for customers environment without having to talk about all this crazy volatility that exists.","Michael Hoffman","Okay. So I think that opened up one quite more question from me, sorry. So the Plano, Texas facility was Michael that's sort of, that's sort of an example of opportunity where lower labor because of the technology we're bringing to bear there.","Don Slager","Well, it's a combination of applying new technology and know-how with a customer who values recycling is willing to pay and willing to take their fair share of the risk. It's a combination of all those things so that may not be the case for every customer, but certainly it was people point they value enough to come to the table and we were looking for a great partner and they found in us. So we're going to continue to push our model and the model works. Jon?","Jon Vander Ark","Yes, allows us to do two things, will take out about half of the labor in a tight unemployment environment that becomes important because that sort of job is can be a tough one to fill it also helps us produce about better product, the technology produces a cleaner product on the end and therefore we think bringing in a little more from what we saw on the back door that facility.","Michael Hoffman","Terrific, thank you.","Jon Vander Ark","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Sean Eastman","Hi, guys, compliments to the team on the first-half and really nice work.","Don Slager","Thanks Jon.","Sean Eastman","Yes. The first question from me is just in light of the first-half sort of price, volume being ahead of expectations and you guys are saying you expecting that momentum to carry into the second-half I think we came into the year with a 2.75% average yield guide and then volume outlook of flat to up 25 bps. I'm just wondering, is that still the algorithm that we're trending to here or is, is that not the way we should be modeling anymore.","Chuck Serianni","I would say that on the yield side, we're probably a little bit higher than the original guidance, maybe something a little bit closer to 3 and then on the volume side, maybe a little bit lower than what we had originally guided to maybe something slightly negative, so -- but net-net in good in good position here for the rest of the year.","Sean Eastman","Okay, that's helpful. And then next one is just on the acquisition $200 million and $550 million. Definitely not a insignificant change versus initial expectations. So I just wanted to get a little bit more color on, on how you guys came that far. I mean is it just a function of timing or is there some sort of change in behavior in terms of your acquisition targets.","Don Slager","Well, it's mostly timing, right, and we start the year we've got a pretty good view of the pipeline, but things develop over time. So remember it went from 200 to 400 to 550. So anyway, the point is we locked it up, and so we know we know we share what we know and we give you numbers that we're confident in, and then as the world moves we've been able to move it up, but some deals maybe move faster than we thought in some deals came to market that we're in the market when we first give you guide to February, Jon.","Jon Vander Ark","Yes, I mean I know the team has done a great job. We've invest in resources and we become a preferred buyer and I would say, we've got a higher number of referrals to buy companies than we ever have, because our that's were employee engagement comes back, we treat the employees that we acquire with dignity and respect, and they understand this is a great place to work, and owners care about money, but they don't care just about the money, they also care about legacy and our people are going to take care of the businesses they built and we've proven ourselves to be very good stewards of the business they're selling to us.","Sean Eastman","Okay, got it. That's helpful. And just last one from me leverage at three times. I think you guys said at the end of the quarter. I'm just wondering kind of later in the cycle where maybe at the higher end of the leverage target, does this mean you guys sort of cool your jets, a little bit at this point or I'm just wondering how you guys are thinking about that.","Don Slager","Well, look, we've kept our leverage at our target leverage now for our over the quarters when we did have very intentionally, right. So we continue to do the work continuing to year. On the debt portfolio, we continue the work on what we think optimum leverage looks like, continue to look at all the other outlooks , that we should look at understand our leverage and we do that consistently, we have a lot of the structural our Board around that. We still think the target is that Optimum is between 2.5 to 3 and frankly more optimally 3. So again if when we're buying cash flow, right, we're growing the business that obviously allows us to actually increase our absolute debt, but still maintain our leverage ratio. So it's just, that's just math. So as long as you're buying really good cash flow at the right multiple with the right returns. We've got frankly a lot of dry powder to do that. There really is no limits on us from that perspective.","Sean Eastman","Yes, that makes sense. All right guys, congrats again. And thanks for the time.","Don Slager","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Derek Spronck of RBC. Please go ahead.","Derek Spronck","Okay, thank you for taking my questions. Just first off, sorry to belabor the acquisition pipeline, but does it 550 make any assumptions around potential divestitures of advanced disposals from the acquisition there.","Don Slager","No, it does not.","Derek Spronck","Okay. In I guess it's still pretty early but, do you see that elevated potential M&A environment carrying forward into 2020 as it stands now. And then on top of that the potential divestitures as well.","Don Slager","Well, it's too early to talk about 2020 again, we'll give you our preliminary outlook in October, and we'll show of that guidance in February. It's a robust. It's a robust pipeline. I will say that and again it's activity is usually driven by sort of similar situations in life changing events and other things that occur. So there is nothing we're really doing to out there and say people to sell, it's all about being there people are ready. And as Jon said, being the right kind of company that people want to sell to. And of course maintaining our flexibility financially to do deals and integrate those quickly.","So, and then as far as the mandated divestitures from the big merger that's been announced, I think it's too early to talk about that. I think from what I know there are still in second request and they've got some work to do, and they publicly said what their target range is for divestitures. You can probably all imagine that we've got a pretty good handle on markets across for at least 48 states. And that when deals like that come to market, we're pretty good at assessing what opportunity might be there for us, or where certain market positions might be something we're interested in. So there might be an opportunity there for us and others, and I'm sure my counterpart at the big green company, Houston has his phone ringing off the wall, with people who want to buy those assets.","Derek Spronck","Okay, that's great color. Thanks, Don. How is the competition for these from the -- are the buyers that you're competing against for potential some of the more attractive assets. And they remain relatively rational or is it a pretty competitive in terms of acquisitions versus your peers there?","Don Slager","I would say, yes, and yes, it's competitive and it's rational. In the end, there's always a mix. You may have to pay more for something that comes with real estate, a permit, a landfill certainly infrastructure, a platform type acquisition in a new market you're trying to expand and into those things that come at a higher purchase price, then a tuck-in. Tuck-ins come at a very nice value and are very quick to turn around to producing cash flow and so on, but -- so competitive, yes, and rational still, yes. There are issues, there are times when may be certain thing comes to market or may be private equity comes into the program, things get a little squarely then. So - but you've seen by our by our pipeline and what we've done, we know we haven't chased deals. We've looked at just about every deal large and small, it's come to market and we haven't bought them all, because sometimes we're not the natural buyer. I think there's always a natural buyer, who has got - some time a leg up with synergy value et cetera on or market position that we don't have.","So, we are a not natural buyer, we're always willing to pay the going price. Maybe it's somebody else's because of their current situation or willingness to believe in what they could do with the asset. And then there's sometimes there's a disrupter in there like private equity. But if you look at what we're paying for deals now last year, the year before that all really pretty rational. And that'll be still our MO as we go forward.","Derek Spronck","Okay, that's great. And then just one last one for myself if I could just on the restrictive markets and the move towards our Wastewater Sewer Index or is there CPI plus type of index. Do you think you'll be able to continue to increase that book of business on your ticket side toward the new index, I mean what happens if a customer just says no, I mean do you just revert back to the original pricing index and try again next time or do you walk away from a contract at that point?","Don Slager","Well, first of all, there's something really great about being the incumbent right because you've already made the capital investment, you know exactly the weight of the trash and the disposal cost and the cost of labor and all the situations that exist in the contract. So nobody knows the cost and the probability of the contractor in more than you do. So that's a good news, we're dealing people that we already have in our book of business.","So we get to know what we're at. If you look at that the success that the team has had that Jon spoke of in his comments, we add to that book every quarter -- what do we have, Jon?. Okay, you know, so when we first went down that road, I would it can't be done, it can't be done. And now here we are a couple years in and we've converted basically 30% of it. So I think frankly when CPI is higher like it is now, it's actually easier to have the conversation with customers because you don't have this big CASM between this half percent CPI and the 3% we need to get out. So, if a customer flat out doesn't want, will not accept the fluctuation of an index, again this is a government index, it's not an index we made up. It's got a lot of science behind it. It makes sense that they would accept that and we negotiate for flat rates of 3% or better, it\u2019s not sometimes it is 4% or better depending. And if the customer just frankly flat out doesn't make us a reasonable return, we cannot obviously keep that customer going forward in the current state. So we're returns based seller, right. The capture tool everything we do is based on the return and this is very capital intensive business, so sometimes we've got to go back in three or four times to get it.","Chuck Serianni","Yes, we have two things on our side, one we're relentless. So we just keep asking two, we're only asking for what's fair. We're asking for a reasonable increase that support our cost increase for employees who live and work in the communities in which we're negotiating. So that argument over time resonates we might not get it immediately because local government it takes time to get things done but we keep asking and we're really pleased with our progress and we do a really good job for customers, right. So, and having said all of that we're every now and then going to walk away from a piece of business because we just can't get there.","Derek Spronck","Okay. No, thanks for the added color, and congrats on a nice quarter, guys.","Don Slager","Thank you.","Chuck Serianni","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is a follow-up from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Feniger","Hey guys, just, Don, you mentioned some softness in the Midwest. Just to be clear, is that something that has transpired recently. Is that something you picked up in June or tracking that way in July? And Chuck, just on the volume side being slightly negative this year, I know you're doing a lot of intention shedding. Is that just the intention shedding portion of the brokerage business that you guys were talking about or was it something underlying of why that might be more negative than what you guys kind of were expecting beginning of the year? Thanks.","Don Slager","Yes, I think the softness I think I would even say more of a slowdown or not being growth expectations. Certain parts of construction you see in the outside of Midwest, some of that's weather related. Right and we've seen some of those markets kind of bounce back to our expectations too. So I wouldn't read too much into that right now.","Chuck Serianni","In terms of the volume growth itself, we have walked away with business as Don mentioned we're very returns focused. So as you know our system begins to show up. We're looking for where we can get the best returns. And we've demonstrated an ability to redeploy assets if certain customers aren't giving us an appropriate return on our work, so that's part of it also.","Don Slager","It's overall look we think we're getting our fair share of the business. We got great sales tools and pricing tools, we've got great pricing internal controls working for our benefit. Again don't lose sight of really strong and crystal clear yield that we report and low churn and improving ROI. I mean those are the results of that kind of internal control environment that Chuck described right. So and again as always, there's always a little bit lumpiness in our business, you lose one big national account and it does ding your revenue growth when your slow growth business like us and if you net all this out, I mean we're growing like we say that we typically do. It's population growth that drives growth in our business. And if you kind of net some of these things we're right on top of that. So we're feeling pretty good about it.","Operator","At this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.","Don Slager","Thank you, Alison. In closing we are extremely pleased with our second quarter performance and well-positioned to achieve our original full-year financial guidance. Our teams let us focus on operational execution, the passion of our customers enable us to deliver these results.","Thank you to everybody. We expanded EBITDA margins by 50 basis points and grew earnings per share by 8%. And then finally, we increased the quarterly dividend by 8% again demonstrating our continued commitment to increase cash returns to shareholders, and also shows our confidence in the cash flow generating capabilities of this business. The team did a great job this year. Thank you everybody. Thank you Republic team. Thank you for spending time with us today. Those of you on the phone, have a good evening, and be safe out there.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy, solid price and volume growth, as well as continued strength in our energy services business, and progress on our multi-year initiatives helped us achieve high single-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow per share.","Highlights of the quarter and nine months ended include adjusted EPS of $0.67, an 8% increase over the prior year, despite a $0.01 headwind from hurricane related costs. Our results were positively impacted by solid execution across our business and a lower tax rate. In July, we raised our EPS guidance range to $2.36 to $2.39, despite the recent decline in recycled commodity prices and costs associated with the hurricanes, we remain very well-positioned to achieve the upper-end of the range.","Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $606 million, a 12% increase over the prior year, after normalizing for the change in cash taxes. On a per share basis, adjusted free cash flow increased 14% over the prior year. Free cash flow was in line with our expectations and we remain well positioned to achieve our full year guidance of $875 million to $900 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28%, total revenue grew 6.3%, core price was 4.1%. Average yield was 2.5% and was strongest in our small container and large container businesses, were the majority of our customers are in open markets.","The reported volumes increased 1.6%. Our volume growth continues to be broad-based and is strongest in the event-driven portion of our disposal business. Energy services revenue was $40 million, an increase of 130% versus the prior year. As part of our revenue enhancing initiatives, we now have approximately $510 million in annual revenue that uses a waste-related index or a fixed rate increase of 3% percent or greater for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and have historically run higher than CPI.","Year-to-date we've invested $385 million in acquisitions including ReCommunity which closed in early October.","The investment in ReCommunity enables us to further vertically integrate our recycling operations without adding capacity in our existing markets. To meet the demands of our customers who have told us recycling is important to them and have also demonstrated a willingness to pay, and to continue to capitalize on secular trends such as the growth in online shopping.","Acquisitions remain a core component of our growth strategy and help us improve our operating density and further strengthen our existing market positions. Our pipeline for the remainder of 2017 and into 2018 is robust and will serve as a catalyst for future profitable growth.","Year-to-date, we returned $682 million of cash to our shareholders as part of our efficient capital allocation strategy. This includes 5.7 million shares repurchased for approximately $357 million. Additionally, our board approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization which extends through 2020. This demonstrates the strength and confidence we have in our ability to grow free cash flow as well as our commitment to increase cash returns to shareholders, while maintaining our investment grade credit rating.","Next, I'd like to discuss some recent events. First, with respect to the hurricanes, we are happy to report that all our employees are safe. In addition, we did not incur any material damage to our assets. Our third quarter results include cost associated with the hurricanes, which were partially offset by revenue from cleanup related work. In the fourth quarter, we expect storm-related revenue to offset additional costs.","I'm extremely proud of the Republic team and would like to thank them for their tireless efforts to care for each other, service our customers, restore our communities and protect our assets. I would also like to acknowledge the generosity of our employees and board of directors, who have contributed $0.5 million to our Employee Relief Fund. With the company's matching donation, the fund has an additional $1 million to further support employees in their time of need.","Second, I'd like to provide Republic's perspective on the recent increase in volatility in recycled commodity prices following China's announcement of its National Sword program. From July to the beginning of October, published OCC export prices declined 52% from a high of $237 per ton to $113 per ton. Since then, prices have rebounded nearly 45% and are now above the 10-year average.","In the past, when comparable programs were implemented, we also saw a temporary increase in pricing volatility. We believe the recent volatility is again temporary and the pricing we saw in early October is not indicative of a new normal. Also, we haven't seen a structural change in the demand for packaging or recovered fiber and believe that continued growth in e-commerce and online shopping will further increase demand.","At Republic, we produce a high-quality product and have established relationships with contracts with some of the largest most reputable buyers and mills across the U.S. and China, as well as Indonesia, Thailand, Korea and India. As a result, we've continued to sell our material without disruption to our partners across the globe and have not warehoused or landfilled any recovered material.","Recent events reinforce our efforts to transition to a durable fee-based model and the need for additional public outreach and education to reduce the amount of recycling contamination of low-value material in the recycling waste stream.","Looking-forward, we expect our average recycled commodity price in 2018 to decrease relative to 2017, yet remain above our 10-year historical average price. We expect a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind from recycling in the fourth quarter and a $0.04 to $0.05 headwind into 2018. We will provide an update on recycled commodity prices on our fourth quarter earnings call in February.","Finally, in September, Republic was named to the gold standard of sustainability rankings for a second consecutive year. We were the only recycling and solid waste company in the world to be named to either the Dow Jones Sustainability North America or World Indices. We share the view of our customers and shareholders who have told us sustainability is important to them. We believe it drives profitability, reduces enterprise risk and enhances long-term value creation.","Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Don. Third quarter revenue was approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of $153 million or 6.3% over the prior year. This 6.3% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 5.9% and acquisitions of 40 basis points. The components of our 5.9% internal growth rate are as follows. First, average yield increased 2.5%, average yields in the collection business was 3.1%, which included 4% yield in the small container business, 3.1% yield in the large container business and 1.9% yield in the residential business.","Average yield in the post-collection business was 1.3%, which included landfill MSW of 1.8%. Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 4.1%. Core price consisted of 5.1% in the open market and 2.3% in the restricted portion of our business. This is the second consecutive quarter we've seen a sequential improvement in restricted core price.","The second component of our internal growth rate is total volume, which increased 1.6% over the prior year. Volumes in the collection business increased 10 basis points. This included a 1.8% increase in our large container business, partially offset by a 1.3% decrease in our small container business. Residential collection volumes were flat versus the prior year.","Small container volumes included a 130 basis point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have been flat versus the prior year.","Within our large container business, temporary C&D hauls were up 4% and recurring hauls were up 1.2%. The post-collection business made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes increased 9%. Landfill volumes increased 10.1%, which included special waste of 24.7%, C&D of 14.5%, and MSW of 20 basis points. In the fourth quarter, we expect a seasonal decline in C&D and special waste volumes.","The third component of our internal growth rate is fuel recovery fees, which increased 30 basis points. The increase relates to rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $2.63 in the third quarter from $2.38 in the prior year, an increase of 10%. The current average diesel price is $2.82 per gallon.","The next component energy services revenue increased 80 basis points. The growth in energy services revenue is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin, where we are well-positioned.","And the final component of our internal growth is commodity revenue , which increased 70 basis points. The growth in commodity sales revenue primarily relates to an increased recycle commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 26% to $167 per ton in the third quarter from $133 per ton in the prior year. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities increased 22%, primarily due to an increase in rebates.","Now, I will discuss changes in margin. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28%, which compares to 28.9% in the prior year. The change includes a 30 basis point increase in landfill operating cost, a 40 basis point headwind due to a favorable legal settlement in the prior year and the 30 basis point increase in cost resulting from the hurricanes. Excluding these items, we had 10 basis points of margin expansion from strong open market pricing and volume growth, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.","Third quarter interest expense was $90 million, which included $11 million of non-cash amortization. Our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 35% and benefited from favorable state tax settlements. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the fourth quarter.","Since we received a number of questions regarding the potential impact of tax reform, I'd like to make a few comments. As a statutory tax rate payer, we would be a direct beneficiary of tax reform. For example, if the federal tax rate has decreased from 35% to 20%, free cash flow would increase by approximately $180 million, or said differently for every 500 basis point reduction in the tax rate, free cash flow would increase by $60 million.","Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $606 million, a 12% increase over the prior year after normalizing for the change in cash taxes. On a per share basis, adjusted free cash flow increased 14% over the prior year.","Finally, as Don mentioned earlier, year-to-date, we've invested $385 million in acquisitions, including ReCommunity. At the same time, we successfully completed the sale of lower margin businesses for $81 million resulting in a net investment of $304 million to-date.","Now, I will turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you, Chuck. Given the predictability and consistency of our business similar to prior years, we are providing a preliminary outlook for next year. We are currently midway through our annual planning process. Based on our initial reviews and assuming current business and economic conditions continue, we project the following for 2018.","Adjusted EPS of $2.53 to $2.58 and adjusted free cash flow of $925 million to $950 million. This represents high single-digit growth in EPS and free cash flow per share, despite a $0.04 to $0.05 headwind from recycled commodity prices. Excluding the impact of recycled commodities, the business is on track to deliver double-digit growth in both EPS and free cash flow per share. We will achieve these results in 2018 by growing both price and volume for the sixth straight year executing our strategy to drive additional operating leverage in the business, effectively deploying capital to fund profitable organic growth and accretive acquisitions, and consistently and efficiently returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Similar to prior years, we will provide detailed financial guidance for 2018 in February of next year. In summary, the current economic backdrop and industry fundamentals combined with our robust acquisition pipeline position us well to deliver another year of strong financial results. At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today will come from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just on operating leverage. I think, Chuck, you mentioned 10 bps margin expansion on high single-digit revenue growth, but at the same time, I think you talked about better leverage in 2018, maybe just walk us through what sort of costs normalize as you get into 2018, the hurricane, some of these landfill operating costs, do they go down. Just walk us through what changes in 2018 where the leverage is much higher than 10 bps.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, So, there's a couple of things that we're looking at, Hamzah, one would be, as you mentioned, the landfill operating costs also were obviously higher this year. We did see a sequential improvement in this operating cost from Q2 into Q3. And obviously into 2018, we continue to see a decrease in those costs as a percentage of revenue. So that would be one thing I would point to.","The other thing is the SG&A line. We do right now have the full cost of our customer resource centers, included in our SG&A, all three centers. This time last year, we only had two of those centers opened, and as we had talked about, we're going to continue to see leverage in the SG&A line, specifically related to those customer resource centers. So those would be the two things that I would point to in particular.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. And just maybe for Don, just any update on the commercial business? One of your smaller competitors highlighted some competitive pressures in certain urban markets. I know you guys are more diversified nationally, but just any color on what you're seeing in the commercial business? Thank you.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Sure. Yeah. Overall right \u2013 we would tell you that it's still very rational in that business. You think about the yields we saw in small container business was 4%, still very strong. Small container volume growth was negative due to, as Chuck said in his commentary, moving away from the broker business. So we've been doing that \u2013 now steadily over a number of quarters, and we'll continue to do that in the next year.","The real reason for it being negative then beyond that is just National Accounts. So we've lost our non-regrettable National Accounts, and we've taken up pretty hard line on making sure that, that portfolio was \u2013 is meeting the appropriate return. And as you know National Accounts business can be a little choppy that way. So overall though we would say it's pretty rational and we continue to see positive growth, container waste kind of flat quarter-to-quarter, but service increases still are greater than service decreases. So, we still think there's additional upside in the small container business for us.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah. Just a follow-up, I'll turn it over. On tax reform, you mentioned the $180 million, if tax rates go to 20%, and it's in the news, the 20%. What do you guys intend to do with the cash? Would that come back in terms of a buyback or how are you thinking about deployment of that cash? Thank you.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Hamzah. So first I'd like to say that the $2 billion repurchase authorization that the board approved doesn't estimate that there'd be any tax reform, right. So, the $2 billion is based on our current performance, the current tax policy, et cetera. So, if you take a look at what we do historically, we've been pretty efficient returning cash to shareholders. Over the last seven years, we've returned about $5.5 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. With this new authorization over the next three years, we expect to return about $3.5 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And that doesn't include any kind of tax reform.","So, again, when we have cash, we put it to work. So, we put it to work in the acquisition pipeline, we return it to shareholders, as I just described, through sort of the normal channels. But that's what we do with it. All of this planning around cash and around our buyback strategy has us keeping our optimum leverage between 2.5 and 3 times. So, there really isn't a need to do anything with debt service or repay debt at this point.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, Don, Chuck and Nicole. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe starting with your commentary on the robust pipeline, just maybe give us some color on where that's weighted to in terms of areas of the business, tuck-ins, with core solid waste, recycling, any kind of color would be helpful.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Sure. Other than the ReCommunity deal, which was a large transaction by itself, once again we bought 26 facilities, 22 were on top of our existing markets, so it was a very nice tuck-in, if you will, to densify and give us more strength in our existing markets. Outside of that, majority was tuck-ins. There were no other really large transactions to speak of and that's what we think the majority going forward. So we'll continue to look at all opportunities large and small that fit our strategy. Again, we're in 240 marketplaces across the U.S. with 39 states. We will look at businesses that are tuck-ins in our current markets, that are contiguous to current markets where we can leverage management and knowhow, but primarily across our core businesses.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks very much for that. And then, understanding that your guidance is preliminary for 2018, I wonder if you can just help us think as concretely as possible at this point how to kind of bridge from the midpoint of this year to next year's free cash flow guidance.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","I will say this that we are anticipating margin expansion in our preliminary guide for next year. Obviously, what we do in our preliminary outlook is give kind of just the big building blocks here, but we'll get into a lot more detail, Noah, in February.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Fully appreciate it. Just wondering, I mean, I don't know if you're factoring in any kind of potential debt refi off of that. You talked about kind of keeping leverage optimal. But I mean, given the credit markets continue to be pretty healthy, how are you thinking about debt refi opportunity over the near and medium-term?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","We have over the course of the next three years or so a little over $2 billion of debt that is coming due. The coupon on that debt is anywhere from the high-3s into the 5s, and so we're looking to be opportunistic as we refinance that debt. If we were to refinance that at current levels, current treasury levels right now, there would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million to $35 million worth of cash savings.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks so much. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question will come from Corey Greendale with First Analysis. Please go ahead.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Hey. Good afternoon. A couple of pretty quick questions. I understand you're not giving more specifics on the guidance but are you willing to say anything about either the GAAP tax rate assumption or the cash tax assumption baked into 2018?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So as I said before, we're a statutory tax rate payer, so your 39.5% is what we're \u2013 what's currently in our model.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","And cash tax charge?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. So cash tax is once again, a little over $100 million \u2013 little over 100% because we're still coming off of bonus depreciation. When we finally anniversary all the way through bonus depreciation we'll go back to a long-term average of just a little under 100% call it 95-ish-percent.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Okay. And then maybe I'll do a two-parter for my second question. Risk management costs have been elevated for a couple of quarters, sort of what's driving that, what's your expectation?","Then my second question is, as you \u2013 I think you had sort of back-end loaded CPI increases and I know you're switching to other indexes, but should we expect given that that you may see higher levels of price in Q4 and going into 2018?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","So, in terms your risk management question, we had a reversal, a favorable development of prior claims last year that didn't repeat this year. So, that's why the year-over-year comparison looks a little less favorable. But that's not something that's long term indicative of the trend in risk insurance. In terms of your question on CPI, right now what we're projecting, what we're seeing as maybe CPI coming in a little about 2% for 2017, if that's the case, if that holds then in July of next year, July of 2018, we get a step up, we get that step up in our restricted pricing and that's probably were 10 basis points to 20 basis points of yield for us.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Excellent. Thanks for the answers.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joe Box of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah, hey guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, landfill costs have crept up pretty much across the space and it seems like we're now going on about four years of volume growth there. So, I'm curious if it's possible to not just fix the cost issues there, but you know maybe aggressively pull the price lever a little more than you have?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, we think that's a great idea, we've been talking about that as well. So, you know we talked a lot over the years about landfill cost and the value of these landfills and they're nearly impossible to replicate, they're expensive to build, to own \u2013 to own into perpetuity. So, we have been consistently raising landfill prices over the last several years. Most of the landfill volume that comes into our sites today, comes from municipalities. So, just like, we're working to move the appropriate escalator index, we use from CPI to something more like water, sewer, trash in our collection business, we're trying to do that in our landfill business as well. So, we're going to continue to focus on that.","For us, some of the landfill costs that have been \u2013 that have been inflated, really have been from just a handful of facilities. So it's not, it's not broad based for us from that perspective, so that's why when Chuck said we think some of that landfill increase is going to come down, as we go through 2018 and we believe that we'll get those handful of sites operating better. But we agree, landfill pricing, when you look at the whole list of pricing, for us landfill price has been 1% and everything else is sort of 3%, 4%, when you get to average yield, so our infrastructure needs to be looked at.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. I mean I guess as my follow-up then. I mean, is it reasonable to think then because we've seen volume flow in at the rate that we have that, we could be on the frontend of a step up or an acceleration in landfill pricing?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, I just described what \u2013 when we're going to try to do, I mean, as we're talking to municipalities about extending contracts again the same conversation that has taken that $2.5 billion book of residential collection contracts and converted over $500 million of it now to an alternative index. Those conversations are now going to be had with the landfill customers as well or municipalities, the same thing is true, we've done that with on the recycling processing side, we've already converted about 80% of that book over to a better in more fair index or value sharing arrangement. So one by one, we're getting through that. And again as I said, landfills is kind of next on our horizon.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Understood. Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Tyler.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Good morning, Tyler.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, Chuck. So, I want to make sure I have the math right on the cash flow statement, you spent $138 million on acquisitions, you noted $385 million year-to-date. So, was all of the delta that $250 million, is that all ReCommunity, or is there some other stuff in there?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","So, about $200 million or so was ReCommunity. And I don't have to say what the statement of cash flows in front of me. So, I'm not \u2013 I would have to look at the rest of it, Tyler.","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Tyler, if you're looking at the statement of cash flow, remember that that's year-to-date.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes.","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","Kind of acquisition cash paid on acquisitions. So, if you take the $385 million number and that we spoke to back out about $180 million for ReCommunity, which again included the 26 operating facilities and some tax attributes, we get back to a number close to what you see on the statement of cash flow.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then well, so from a modeling perspective, assuming what we know now assume that all the acquisitions that you've done is all you do, do you kind of have what the revenue rollover impact would be in 2018 from those, and maybe what the rollover impact from the divestitures would be?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, a net number then would be revenue contribution is about 185 basis points.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Oh, okay, okay.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, perfect.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, that number.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, and so how much are you expecting to benefit from the call center consolidation?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Right now it's too early to tell. We'll give you more detail on that Tyler in February.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And just maybe last one here. But is there any way to quantify how much of the landfill operating cost was maybe extraordinary, I mean, is there, is there any number kind of that we can think about just maybe falling off in 2018?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","You know, it depends on how quickly we can actually lower these costs. Keep in mind also that the majority of these costs have to do with us reducing leachate volumes that are actually in the landfills themselves in order to make them operate more efficiently. So, it really depends how quickly we're able to do that, right. So, these are costs that we're incurring today to really help the long-term effectiveness of the landfill. So, right now, I don't have a good estimate that I can give you in terms of the timing, but we do expect that they will go down in 2018.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And maybe, sorry one, one last one. But are you \u2013 when you talk about margin expansion next year, are you including the dilution from ReCommunity, so as we see it on the P&L?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes. I am including that.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you, Don, Chuck and Nicole for taking my questions. On the operating leverage, if I can come back there's a multipart to it. 10 basis points but you also have recycling very favorable, so how do I adjust for the year-over-year 26% increase in recycling prices, clearly it says the margin leverage is better?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. You get to keep in mind the costs that we incurred also Michael, associated with the recycling facilities. You know, the whole China National Sword, because of that as you, as you're very familiar, there was a higher quality that needed to be produced in our facilities, that created more cost. And so that offset some of the benefit that we saw associated with higher commodity pricing.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, you're saying that there's \u2013 well, that would actually make my case even stronger. So your margins in recycling is even lower. So, if I backed out recycling year-over-year like-to-like, the operating leverage of the garbage company is better than 10 basis points?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","It is better than 10 basis points, it's absolutely right.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. That's what I'm trying to get at. What that number -","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Michael without giving all the detail, when we constructed here the various component \u2013 parts of our business, we saw a really strong operating leverage in our small container business, in our large container business, whereas you know as density grows, margins grow with it. So that part of the business is working great. We had this noise around recycling, as Chuck described. And we did a lot of acquisition work. So, we've got some acquisitions startup costs in the quarter.","The good news is, we did a lot of acquisitions; the bad news is, we had a lot of acquisition startup costs. So, we've also been investing in our digital platform, investing in some other fleet issues. As Chuck said, though, the leachate issues. So, and we're making decisions to run the business better that we think will all benefit us in 2018. But there's definitely margin expansion going on in the right parts of the business, that we expect. And since, we had such a strong quarter and we're still guiding to the high-end of the range and producing a lot of cash flow, we're making some other investments along the way.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So following that line of thinking, what's the EBITDA and free cash flow implications of your penny in 2Q, and 4Q and your $0.05 to $0.06 in 2018 -- $0.04 to $0.05 in 2018 from recycling?","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","Michael, it's a balance, call it say like 10 basis points, when you look into 2018. 10 basis points to 20 basis points.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","10 basis points to 20 basis points on EBITDA?","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","Yes.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then in your free cash flow outlook for next year. If you start with a $253 million and work upwards it clearly there's margin expansion. But when you start thinking about the components of cash flow from ops, it looks like you have a pretty healthy working capital use going into 2018. And I'm trying to understand why that would be versus your normal pattern.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. No, Michael, we're not seeing that. We're not seeing any unusual increase in working capital.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. All right. We'll go back and fine-tune the model more then. All right. Thanks for taking my questions.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Take care, Michael.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Just following up on some of the questions on the initial outlook for the cash flows next year. I'm just wondering if you can give any initial look at CapEx either on a dollar basis or percentage of sales or even just maybe directionally from the 2017 levels where you think you'll be landing in 2018.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, our CapEx, as a percentage of revenue, has trended about 10%, maybe a little bit less than that. And we right now are expected to be at a similar level for 2018.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And it seems like this year's cash flow and next year's guidance implies maybe something in the very low-30s as a percentage of EBITDA. And I know comparing you to others in the industry isn't totally fair. You've got a different tax rate, different capital structure, lots of different things. But some of the others have made a little bit of progress moving that up recently. I'm just wondering if you're thinking about the number that we're at this year or next year, there's any sort of unique things that might go away. Maybe it's the CapEx coming down, maybe it's like you see those cash taxes reverting back a little bit. But where do you sort of see that free cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA settling out in a more normalized environment?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. We think that for next year, it'd probably be relatively in the same zone as a percentage of EBITDA. Longer-term, we are looking at the tax side of the equation to see if there's anything that we can do there to help lower the cash taxes we pay. We're obviously very much focused in on our post closure liabilities also, making sure that we're being intelligent about how we spend that cash. And looking at our cash interest rate also and seeing what we can do in terms of lowering the amount of cash that we're paying there.","So, we are focused in on it. I would say that we're working very diligently on it. I wouldn't say that we've got a lot of arrows in the quiver here in order to kind of slay this dragon. The one huge benefit for us would be tax reform. So, just doing the math very quickly, if we were to get tax reform, if the federal tax rate were to go from 35% down to 20%, that would increase the conversion from where we are right now, to your point, in the low 30s almost to 40%. So it would be huge for us.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. And Brian, remember that, as we grow, growth requires CapEx. And at the same time, we're still working on extending the useful life of the fleet. So, we're only partway through that initiative and we'll see benefit from that yet in 2018 and a little bit beyond.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And just shifting to the recycling topic, you mentioned I think in response to one of prior questions that you have a little bit of expenditure to try and get to the tightened spec in China. I guess they're looking to get things down to as low as 0.3%, which I think most people we've talked to said, it's pretty unachievable. I guess, maybe if you could just give your own comment as to how realistic that is given the current set of technologies that we've got in the industry and where do you think that this spec will eventually settle out at?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, I think it's too early to tell. Again, we've seen this type of thing before. Everyone agrees, they're really serious about it. But, again, we think we have a better starting point than a lot of people have. So, I know there's been a lot of things in the press, people talking about how this has impacted them more negatively than it has us. But, one, again, we're just starting by a better place. We've invested a lot in our facilities over recent years to make them more efficient to produce a high-quality pack to reduce residual.","And so we're going to continue to work on it like everybody else and it'll level out at some point, but I think it's too early to tell where they'll really end up. At the end of the day, they need fiber and packaging demand isn't going to go down in my mind. It's not going to go down on my household, I'm pretty sure. So, we think we're going to be in a good place when it all shakes out.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And have you seen any pickup in export orders yet? I think we've been hearing kind of maybe that some of the import licenses for 2018 will be granted maybe later this month, but just wondered if there's any people who have some licenses leftover that they're using now or any pickup just in the last couple of weeks there?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So for us, we have never had an interruption in shipping, right. So we don't warehouse our inventory material. We don't play the market. We consistently flow material out of our facilities, ship it regularly, we've never had a back up, we haven't landfilled any material. I know people have reported they have had to, we have not. So, we haven't seen any interruption in the flow of the business.","So the rate structure is a little different story, but we've seen no interruption in that, as I said in my comments we've had longstanding relationships with good reputable partners across the globe. Again we ship a fair amount of our material domestically, even though we understand it's a global market. But China, now India, South Korea and then the list goes on. So we've got a lot of outlets and we've got a lot of great partners. And as it settles down I think we'll be in a good place.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Just one last one for me. Can you -","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","I would back up by this, willingness to pay for recycling in the U.S. is on the increase. So we continue to report for instance in our open market business \u2013 our open market recycling customers are paying 90% of the rates they pay for solid waste because they're willing to pay. And so, we need to take that same approach across our residential business, across our franchise business.","The customers are saying they're willing to pay for it and they are. And because they value the idea of recycling and sustainability. And their viewpoint is simply if I'm going to carry it out to the curve, I'm okay paying garbage prices, I just want you to do something positive with it, right. So and I want you to prove to me that you do. And that's what we're doing and it's working. So it's been very effective in the open market. Now, we've got to get busy moving it into some of these longer term contracts. But the consumerism of recycling is on the upswing and that's where people have to understand.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks for those comments. Just one last one. I can't remember if you said anything in the prepared remarks, if you did I apologize, but any expected benefit in the fourth quarter or 2018 from some of the hurricane cleanup activities?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, as we said we got about a penny negative from total hurricane net-net in Q3. We're going to have kind of flat impact in Q4, and then we'll get that trickled in benefit into next year. So, think about it, three different hurricanes were, you know enough about what happened in Houston, but we've got a lot of landfill space in Houston, so we're going to benefit there on the landfill side, and then to the construction material that comes through Puerto Rico is a similar story, although there's much more devastation, but we're well positioned there with landfills. We've got a great workforce in Puerto Rico.","The people there got back to work within seven or days to nine days of the hurricane. So, we're one of the first ones to get back to work and landfills are in good shape. So, where we have landfills, we'll get some benefit as we go through time. And then, the Florida hurricane really hit for the most part of the Keys, and Marco Island, Naples and we're just kind of in that market. So, we just maybe lost one day of work in the process, and not a lot of benefit there. So anyways, well it'll just trickle in as they rebuild, and we're heavily situated prepared in the market with great assets and great people and we'll get our fair share of that business.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys, just a couple of quick ones, most of the good ones are taken.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Lang. Good afternoon, Mr. Lang.","Edward A. Lang","Thank you, Gabby. Welcome, good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. This is Ed Lang and I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services' first quarter 2012 conference call. Don Slager, our CEO; and Tod Holmes, our CFO, are joining me as we discuss our first quarter performance.","Before we get started, I would like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information that we discuss on today's call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties and may be materially different from actual results.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we discuss Republic Services' first quarter performance. Before we get started, I want to acknowledge Tod Holmes' announcement regarding his plan to retire next year. First, I want to say that everyone at Republic has great respect for Tod and we also respect his decision. Fortunately, he has given us a full year to work a smooth transition. Secondly, Tod has built an incredibly capable and talented financial team here at Republic, inclusive of solid financial processes, sound controls, and of course, a strong balance sheet. Tod has been one of the primary architects of the company's success, fostering and establishing a lasting culture that is firmly committed to creating cash value for our owners, with steadfast management, focusing on return on investment with a balanced approach to cash utilization. Additionally, besides his 15 years of service to Republic and the countless contributions he has made along the way, he has certainly been an invaluable adviser to me in the past 1.5 years. We will save all of our goodbyes and our thank yous for next year as Tod will be with us for a while, and we have plenty of work to do together before we host his retirement party. I'll ask Tod to share his thoughts with you.","Tod C. Holmes","Thanks, Don. As Don said, I've announced my retirement. It's effective May 1, 2013. But it's a pretty simple story here. I turn 65 years old in 2013, and have always planned on retiring then. As part of my contract, I'm required to give the company a 1-year notice prior to my actual retirement. Therefore, I informed Don and the board of my decision at this week's board meeting. I do want to stress to everyone that I'm fully committed to my job here at Republic. We've got a great team, as Don indicated here, and I'm committed to serving Republic over the next 12 months. Don and I, along with, obviously, the board's input, will be working together to ensure a smooth and seamless transition. So with that, we'll go ahead and start the call. I'll turn it back to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Tod. I will now review our first quarter financial performance before discussing our revised guidance for 2012. Revenue of approximately $2 billion. Core price growth in the quarter was 0.6%, with positive price in both collection and disposal businesses. Disposal includes MSW landfill price of 2.6%. Volumes increased by 0.2%. Our first quarter earnings per share was $0.38. Our adjusted free cash flow was $175 million. We repurchased 1 million shares in the first quarter for $31 million. We have approximately $620 million remaining under our authorization to return to our shareholders through 2013. We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Total cash returned to the shareholders was approximately $112 million during the first quarter. Some of our operational achievements during the first quarter include: Our safety performance continues to improve with a 4% favorable reduction in our frequency rate. We have closed on $65 million of acquisitions through April that represents $40 million of annual run rate revenue. These are highly accretive transactions and we expect to achieve the upper end of our acquisition range of $100 million. We have maintained our return on investment focus when reviewing the acquisition market. We continue to invest in fleet automation and converting the fleet to CNG. During the first quarter, we converted 67 routes to automated vehicles and placed 140 CNG vehicles in service. Our 2012 truck order includes 550 CNG vehicles, which is 65% of our total fleet order. We opened our renovated single stream recycling facility in Anaheim, California, which increases our recycling capacity in that market by 50,000 tons per year. ","I would like to thank our field operations for their continued support in executing our strategy of achieving profitable growth and maintaining a safe work environment. Tod and Ed will now update our financial performance.","Tod C. Holmes","Thanks, Don. First quarter 2012 revenue, as Don indicated, was approximately $2 billion and reflects the following components of internal growth. First, core price growth of 0.6%. This level of core price was in line with our expectations that we spoke to in February for our first quarter. Core price is positive in both collection and disposal businesses, with slightly higher prices in the disposal business due to landfill MSW price increases of 2.6%. Within that component of our business, our third-party open market landfill customers were increasing the price in the range of 4% to 5%. We expected the first half of the year to be below 1% with prices rising modestly in the second half of the year as the impact from higher CPI base pricing takes hold on a restricted customer base. We still expect to see this increase in CPI-based pricing in the second half of the year, but we do see pressure on price levels from new business in the open market, and also, retention efforts in the open market and municipal segments. As a result, as Don will describe in more detail later, we now expect our full year 2012 price to be approximately 1%. ","Our fuel recovery fee was positive 0.5%. The increase in the fuel recovery fee relates to an increase in fuel costs. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $3.97 in the first quarter of 2012 from $3.63 in the prior year. This is an increase of 9%. ","Our commodity revenue decrease was 0.8%. Commodity prices decreased 18% to an average price of $122 a ton in the first quarter of this year from $149 per ton in the prior year. Q1 recycling facility commodity volume of 508,000 tons was up 6.3% from the prior year and up 5.2% on a same-store basis. This volume increase compared to the prior year and was in line with our expectation. Our revised 2012 guidance is based upon current commodity prices of $120 per ton compared to our original guidance of $118 per ton. This provides a little bit of a tailwind, for reference purposes, a $10 per ton change in commodity values equals approximately $0.03 of EPS. And that also includes the impact on our recycling facility and collection businesses. ","Now turning to volume, Q1 volume increased 20 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see volume improvements in the collection line of business. Q1 collection volume was negative 0.1%, and that improved 10 basis points over Q4 levels. Industrial volume was positive year-over-year, driven by a lot of construction activity, and commercial is only slightly negative. Disposal volumes were down 1.3% versus the prior year, which is made up of MSW tons at our transfer stations and landfills. This was partially offset by higher levels of landfill special waste volumes. Our Q1 2012 volume performance includes the impact of one more work day versus the prior year, which resulted in a 50 basis point increase in revenue. ","Now I'll discuss the first quarter year-over-year margin. First quarter 2012 adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.1% compared to 30.6% in the prior year, a 250 basis point decrease. This decline primarily relates to the following 4 items: First, maintenance and repairs. We saw a 90 basis point increase in expense that relates to an increase in the cost of tires across our supplier base, the refurbishing of containers versus purchasing new containers and upfront implementation costs associated with our One Fleet maintenance initiative. Our approach to repair versus replace containers results in a higher level of expense, but it's capital efficient and results in a lower total cash cost. We expect to work through discontinuing our inventory by the end of the year. Second, fuel. The unfavorable fuel expense increase of 60 basis points was due to the 9% increase in the cost of diesel. Our revised 2012 guidance is based upon current fuel cost of $4.13 per gallon compared to the original guidance of $3.86 per gallon. For reference purposes, a $0.10 change in diesel fuel per gallon is about $0.01 of EPS. And this also includes the impact of fuel recovery fees. The third margin factor is the work day increase. There is an approximate 60 basis point increase in expenses as a percentage of revenue associated with the additional work day in the quarter. This impact can be seen in almost all cost categories, but obviously, it's most notable in the labor expense. This results from the additional expense of servicing our customers one more day, where the revenue is, on many cases, on a fixed fee basis, and therefore, very little corresponding revenue increase. ","Finally, SG&A expenses. The 80 basis point increase in expense relates to investments in our sales force, which occurred throughout last year, and also, increased levels of bad debt expense partially offset by a reduction in consulting expenses. The 40 basis point increase in bad debt expense primarily relates to onetime recoveries realized in the prior year. SG&A expense at 11.2 % of revenue reflects the seasonality of our historically lowest revenue quarter of the year, as well as the highest level of payroll taxes that tend to max out earlier in the year. We expect full year SG&A expense to be slightly above 10% of revenue, which is fairly consistent with the prior year. ","Turning to our DD&A. DD&A as a percentage of revenue was 11.8% this year versus 11.5% in the prior year. The 30 basis point increase in expense relates to a landfill liability adjustment recorded in the current quarter for a site that recently closed. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues due to the amortization of intangibles. ","Now I'll turn the call to Ed, who will discuss interest expense, taxes and free cash flow.","Edward A. Lang","Thanks, Tod. First quarter 2012 interest expense was $104 million, which included $17 million of noncash amortization. As we previously stated, in the second quarter of 2012 we expect to call the notes due in June 2017. The interest benefit of this refinancing is included in our full year guidance. ","Our first quarter effective tax rate is favorably impacted by closing out state audits and changes in estimates on certain tax matters. We now expect our full year 2012 tax rate to be approximately 37%, but this will fluctuate by quarter. ","I will now discuss free cash flow. First quarter 2012 adjusted free cash flow was $175 million, which consisted of cash provided by operating activities of $334 million, less property and equipment received of $207 million, plus proceeds from the sale of property of $5 million, plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of $41 million, plus divestiture-related payments of $2 million. Therefore, adjusted free cash flow equals $175 million. Free cash flow timing tends to vary by quarter, in particular due to capital expenditures and changes in working capital. We expect to achieve the lower end of our full year guidance range of $775 million to $800 million. ","Now I'll talk about the balance sheet. At March 31, our accounts receivable balance was $808 million, and our days sales outstanding was 37 days or 23 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $6.9 billion at March 31, and excess credit available under our bank facility was approximately $1.6 billion. ","I will now turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Ed. Now I'll update our 2012 guidance. We expect adjusted free cash flow at the lower end of our original guidance of $775 million to $800 million. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.86 to $1.90, which is down from our original guidance of $1.98 to $2.02. Our EPS guidance is primarily impacted by lower-than-expected internal growth, higher fuel expense, implementation cost associated with our maintenance initiative and certain onetime costs. Our revised guidance assumes a normal seasonal earnings pattern of 47% to 48% in the first half of the year and the balance in the second half. We expect price to be approximately 1%. We expect full year volume performance to be flat, down from our original guidance of 0.5%. Our volume expectations are being negatively impacted primarily by 3 distinct MSW disposal locations and a large national account contract loss. ","EBITDA margins for the full year of 29.5% compared to our original guidance of 30.5%. We expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 37%. We will remain focused on executing our strategy, while improving return on capital through continued disciplined pricing; utilizing our ROI-based tools; growing the business through sales, acquisitions and investments in recycling and processing technology, protecting our profitable business that generates appropriate returns; managing our cost structure through programs designed to gain operational efficiencies, including fleet automation, CNG conversion and standardized managed practices; investing in our people through training and development and maintaining a safe and positive work environment, allowing us to continue to attract and retain top talent; also, enhancing our customer's experience with Republic by continuously improving service delivery and providing solutions to meet their changing demands and buying habits. ","At this time, operator, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And that first question comes from Scott Levine with JPMorgan.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess my first question really would be, it's only been 2 months since you set guidance, so what's changed? I'm a little surprised to see things change this quickly, general speaking. So maybe I'll just -- without focusing in on price or cost or any particular item, just wondering how things could have changed or your view of the world could've changed this much this quickly.","Donald W. Slager","Well, I guess we need to talk about price and volume because that's a part of it. They're 2 of the major components there. When we built our business plan, as we do every year, we kind of consider how we see the world kind of exit speed Q4 and then what are we seeing at the time. We were finalizing the budget in January and setting guidance in February. At that time, we felt a little better about the economy than we do today. We thought we'd see a little more economic lift than we're seeing right now. We thought the pricing environment in the open market would improve a little bit. It really hasn't. We've maintained our -- the cadence of our pricing programs, so we're out in the general market. Pricing is frequently and is consistently as it were last year. Our price to customer was about 2.7% in the quarter. So that's continued. We've seen a continued pressure from the municipal segment in the sort of rollbacks in renewing business. That's pretty consistent with what we thought. And then this fleet initiative has cost us a little more than we figured. So that -- we talked about that quite a bit last year, Scott. In 2010, we decided we needed to focus more on fleet. We're about, I think, the 8th largest vocational fleet in the nation. And to take the customer service assurance and the productivity to the next level, we need to run our fleet consistently across the nation. We saw some disparity on how our fleets were operating. And so we designed this One Fleet program. We piloted last year. We began to roll it out late last year, and we've gone now and broadened that initiative here in the early part of '12. And what we're seeing is as we're -- the real main focus there of the fleet initiative is to move more to scheduled maintenance and less reactive maintenance to get to that level of productivity and customer service we're trying to achieve. And in order to do that, we've got to spend additional money, that's sort of a temporary adjustment, a little bit of a bow wave, if you will, to move to the level of a kind of world-class maintenance we want to run our fleet at. So rather than back off of it, we've decided to move forward with it even though it's going to cost us more this year. We're coming to you and letting you know that it's critical enough for us that we're going to adjust our guidance. We're going to move through the initiative over the next 3 years and become a world-class fleet.","Tod C. Holmes","Yes. Scott, where we look at it, obviously, as Don said, we saw this volume situation here late in the quarter and then this quarter, early in the fourth quarter and here in April. And again, when you look at the cost, as Don indicated, we think that we were seeing about 90 basis points of cost increases kind of on a year-over-year basis. And so that's probably around $0.12. And there's really, as Don said, 3 big items. We got the maintenance, which is the truck. It's also the container maintenance, which is probably worth about 5 to 10 basis points, which we'll work through this year. So while the maintenance might be with us for a couple of years, the container is probably just this year. We've got the fuel, which everyone is aware of, which is about $0.03 of earnings in an addition to a $0.04 in maintenance. And then we have landfill. We got higher leachate because of the warm weather in the Northeast, and we also had some other close site costs at one particular landfill, which we think are kind of a either current quarter or current year situation that should mitigate -- be mitigated next year.","Donald W. Slager","We've also seen 4 distinct volume impacts since we set our guidance that equal that 50 basis points.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then maybe as my follow-up, just to kind of understand this and really reconcile the change in guidance with the business environment that you're seeing. So it sounds like most of the revision is internal and programmatic as opposed to the business climate being what it is. But maybe if you could separate the business climate then from the program spending and talk a little bit about -- it sounds like, frankly, you've gotten more guarded on the business environment as the quarter's progressed. Is that an accurate interpretation? How conservative should we think of your guidance's being with regard to the business environment, which, from a macro perspective, seems to be stable, if not improving a little bit?","Tod C. Holmes","Yes, I would say, we got $0.38 of earnings in the first quarter. And we think our guidance is realistic. Again, as Don indicated, and we said this repeatedly, our business is fairly predictable and we get about 46% to 48% of the earnings in the first half of the year, and 52% to 54% in the second half of the year. So early April, as we were closing out the first quarter, what we were seeing there plus what we were seeing in the competitive environment here in April as well is kind of a flatter economy than what we were expecting, led us to conclude that we weren't going to get the lift from the economy and that the competitive landscape was remaining maybe a little bit more competitive than we originally thought, whether it's in volume or in price, both those categories.","Operator","And our next question comes from Corey Greendale with First Analysis.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","So the first question, I guess, just a little bit more on the competitive environment. So is there any change on how you would describe your behavior as far as how you're viewing price competitively?","Donald W. Slager","No. I think -- I mean, we've talked about this a lot. I know I mentioned it in my earlier comment. Our price to customers is running about 2.7%. There's always churn in the business. It's always a competitive business. Through all that churn and mix and service increase, decrease, new account, lost account, we end up posting this 0.6% price. So we're still actively pricing in the marketplace. If you look at our landfill pricing, price in the open market MSW is 4% to 5%. So for those people using our landfills in the open market, they're seeing continuously a 4% to 5% increase. So that's continuing. Having said that, we're not really gaining new accounts in the landfill, and we probably lost more open market landfill accounts than we've gained because we're not willing to subsidize competition. We're going to continue to raise landfill prices because the cost of owning people's trash infinito, you can't solve that by volume. You've got to charge a certain amount to get that return. So we've continued that consistent strategy and we're not going to change. Open market, we have our RPM pricing program. As we've talked about, in the open market about 1\/12 of our customers receive a price increase a month in the open market. We work through a review of the cost and we look at what we think price elasticity is and we price our business. We also then have to go through a continuous effort of defending business. We got a good business, high margin business, so we got to defend, then we use our ROI tools and we have what we call a walk-away price. At some point, we won't keep a customer for less than what we think is a reasonable return. But we do defend vigorously. So our actions haven't changed from that perspective. One thing we started talking about last year, and that is understanding, by market, who's taking share at our expense. And today, we're very good at understanding, by market, who's taking share at our expense, and we have a sales staff that is targeted at saving business from those, call it, predators, and also making sure that we're selling accordingly into their lines of business. Because we can't just simply watch share leave as the total pie really isn't growing very much. So that all impacts churn. But again, we're very consistently using our ROI tools, our whole strategy and our compensation programs, and personally, the out-of-pie [ph] philosophy is very grounded in ROI. But we've got a good -- we always fight a good competitive fight. ","On the volume side, I mentioned 50 basis points of volume that we expected to maintain and has already gone away in the year. We lost a large national account, which is about $25 million reported revenue this year or about 30 basis points of that 50 basis points. And then we've lost 3 -- or we know we've lost 2 disposal contracts that we've contracted with municipalities. Those were based on price. Somebody decided to undercut us on the price and we weren't willing to lower our price of the landfills for that business. The last piece of that is, as you guys are familiar with, L.A. The Puente Hills Landfill has got a scheduled closing date. They have gotten even more aggressive on attracting volume because they're going to walk away from air space. And so that market has just further been depressed over the last 30 or 60 days, and so we just can't close our eyes to those volume adjustments. Those volumes are gone. And we don\u2019t necessarily think we can make them up. We're not just going to chase volume to do that. We've got to be reasonable and responsible. So a long answer to your question, Corey, but I think our approach to the business hasn't changed. We may be tougher than ever as far as defending business, and we're certainly a little more prescriptive, understanding who's taking share at our expense.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. So I appreciate all that detail and on -- I also appreciate detail on the cost side. Can you just, on the cost side, help us think through a little bit more specifically about what portion of the lower margin guidance is really attributable to nonrecurring costs or things that won't be there at least in 2013?","Tod C. Holmes","Well, I think that the majority of it is, I would say the fuel and fuel-related, which is maybe about 1\/3 of that 90 basis points, could be with us on an ongoing basis. The other items, which are about 60 basis points, would be either dropping off this year, or in the case of our fleet initiative, that's probably about -- that's like a '13 and '14 type of timeframe for us with -- that will continue on as we roll through our larger shops into our medium-sized and smaller shops across the country. So that's a multi-year situation. But again, we should be harvesting the value out of that here through fewer road calls and a more efficient fleet in the future.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vance Edelson with Morgan Stanley.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The predators that you referred to, Don, could you give us a feel -- are they becoming more predatory, more competitive, recently? And if so, is it your expectation that, that's going to continue or do you think they're eventually going to have to get more disciplined given their own cost pressures?","Donald W. Slager","Well, I can't speak for them, right? I don't think necessarily the small haulers have gotten more competitive or more active. Again, the whole pie really isn't growing, so they want to keep their trucks on the street. We're-- one of the things we're adjusting our guidance off of is fuel, right? We're paying $4.16 a gallon for fuel today. Some of these small haulers like to sell no fees, and I don't know how they adjust their pricing and make any money if they're not raising prices at some point with this high fuel cost. So we'd like to think that we'd see a little more price activity there, but again, I can't speak on their behalf. So -- and we have seen some spots in some markets where things have gotten more competitive by, I would say, across the board, both large and small, even a couple of national companies that have been maybe overly opportunistic in a couple of spots. I mentioned those couple of big MSW disposal contracts we lost. We were a little surprised that -- at the rates that those contracts were let for. So the national account I spoke of, our margins were very, very thin there. We enjoyed a 7-year relationship with that national account. We did a lot of good work for them, continued to reduce their price, build their efficiency, recycle more waste, and we were a little surprised by what happened there. And when we met with them, it was just strictly a price issue. And we just weren't willing to lower price any further. So we're going to continue to be diligent raising prices, as I said before. We're going to safeguard our infrastructure. We're not going to give it away to undercapitalized competitors and we're going to continue to fight hard in the marketplace. So that's the state of the business. And obviously, I think a lot of this is resolved if the economy does take off and some of the things you read about actually come true, but we don't have that crystal ball. So if the economy improves, we think market behavior improves, and then we think -- I think we all win from that.","Vance Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then another question that's also related to the competitive landscape. Is the M&A pipeline robust because smaller players are putting their hands up more than they used to? Or is it because you've gotten more aggressive in pursuing these targets? Or is it a little of both?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, I don't know, I think it's tax planning. I think it's succession planning. And we've got many, many stories from some of our sellers. They want to move on to a different part of their life. They're concerned about taxes and the change in tax law. There's a lot of different stores there. But we think it's a robust pipeline. And as we said before, we think we can take advantage of kind of a steady diet of acquisitions over the next several years in  and around the $100 million a year range at a very good multiple. It's a very good use of our cash and there are some very nice businesses out there that we're going to be looking at over that period of time. So we've had a lot of good success and we'll continue that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Can we talk a little bit about the sort of things that are happening in the macro marketplace? And I'm probably going to exceed my 2 question thing as we do this, but let's try. We're hearing special waste activity has now settled into normal routine special waste ex stimulus-driven. If you're in the right geographies, there is oil field waste activity. MSW has kind of found a level, but it's not really recovering, it's just kind of hanging. When you listen to other calls and talk to private players and what have you, what's your view of that kind of environment?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, Michael. Special waste is good for us. It's relatively flat to last year. We are getting our fair share of the natural gas drilling waste. Again, 2 or 3 years ago, we had none, we had no revenue from that business. Today, it's a nice little business for us, we focus on it. But as you said, we're not in all geographies. So what's going on in North Dakota is kind of a neat story and a headline, but we're not in North Dakota so we don't get to take advantage of that volume. The rolloff business has been decent for us. We've talked about the industrial strengths we saw last year in coming through Q4. We just haven't necessarily seen it get stronger. People ask me, what about automotive? And frankly, we're not a big player in automotive. The margins in that business tend to be very small, automotive companies tend to be sort of very aggressive purchasers of services, and it's not been a big segment for us. So I can't really speak to that. Construction, we had a good seasonal -- I mean, more than expected seasonal activity and temp rolloff in Q1, but we also had no winter. So we're not going to hang our hat on that thinking that's the baseline to go forward from. We have -- we think some belief that some of that was pull forward, roofing jobs, slight constructions for some early spring cleanup. So we're not so sure about what that means yet for the year. And as you know, we don't really see true seasonality until May and June, and that's when we can really tell you what's happening there. Commercial is kind of flattish, still a little bit down, and we've had improving volume for a lot of sequential quarters in the collection business. We just haven't been able to come over the top and turn positive yet. So I don't think -- I don't know if the economy is getting worse, but it's not -- I don't really see it getting too much better and it's certainly not getting as when we posted original guidance. We thought it was getting a little better at more of a rapid rate. So some of this is about velocity of change. And we're just -- we're not willing to go further in the year with our former guidance based on what we're seeing today.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then understanding the 150 basis point impact in EBITDA on the revised guidance...","Tod C. Holmes","It's 100 basis points. It's [indiscernible] 30.5 to 29.5, with 19 basis points of that coming out of cost. Commodities is a positive 20 basis points. And then dropping the price is probably a negative 30 basis points from, say, 1.5% down to about 1%. That's kind of how we get to 100 basis points. And the first quarter's margin is obviously driven very much by the normal seasonal makeup of the business as we described earlier.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Right. So I guess part of the question I was going to -- and thank you for that information, to ask about the maintenance -- the 4 items you identified earlier, the maintenance, fuel, work day and SG&A, the maintenance and the work day would have seemed to have been known back on February 9, where I get the fuel and the SG&A were maybe things that can happen later in the quarter, but...","Tod C. Holmes","Well, the maintenance wasn't really known. I think that this is something that has continued to evolve as we've gone from a few pilot locations to a broader rollout.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, that's a thing you've got to understand, Michael, we fanned out here, right? So we've gained speed and traction. So we went from a handful of facilities, and now, we're multiplying them with facilities we're touching, and that's where we started to see this thing ramp up. And again, we could've -- we could make 2 choices, right? We could say, hey, stop, slow down. But again, as I said earlier, we believe we've got to get through this. We believe -- as you know, I mean, look at our operating cost, we're -- we've got strong margins, we're good operators. To get to the next level of efficiency and customer experience, we need to have better fleet reliability. And then that part of that is moving to, as I said, more programmatic maintenance and planned maintenance versus reactive maintenance. And what that means is you've got to sort of move through that phase. And so there's a little bit of sort of maintenance catch up to get you to that point where your fleet availability and uptime improves, your road calls decrease and you're really doing planned maintenance. And so that's -- it's a lot of work, it's a real high touch, real high change, change management process, but we don't think we can put it off. We think we need to move through it and I think it's going to pay dividends in a lot of ways: customer experience, productivity, driver morale, even frankly, mechanic retention. Mechanics are hard to come by. Good mechanics want to work for a company that takes maintenance seriously the way we are, and it's all going to pay dividends. Just it's going to take some time and we've got to make the investment. So I mean it's the right thing to do and we didn't feel it was a good thing to say, \"Hey, this is harder than we thought, a little more expensive, let's stop.\" And we think that, frankly, would've negatively impacted the morale of the business and the future of the business.","Tod C. Holmes","Michael, I mean you have a good question there in terms of our visibility, I guess, a couple of months ago. And again, when you look at this, we've got an impact of about $0.06 in price. And that's something that has really just emerged here, I would say, in the last 30 days to 45 days at the most. And then the volume is the same sort of thing. I mean, that's just a very current thing that we're realizing. The commodity is, obviously, a positive. That's about $0.03. And then when you look at this $0.12 of cost increase.  The fuel, we didn't anticipate. We were very explicit in the guidance there. I think the maintenance for containers was something, as Don indicated, is something that has evolved recently, and the container maintenance is just a smart thing to do from a cash standpoint. So a lot of these costs are things that are more current in nature. Now we also have some positive things. Our original tax guidance was 39%. And in interest also, I think the credit markets are probably a little bit more favorable. So we've got a little bit of a benefit, we think, on taxes and also on interest. And in fact, as -- we've got a number of open tax years. We got 3 cycles, we've got some other planning issues and opportunities. So we may do a little bit better than that. But again, these are things that have recently unfolded. And we, frankly, Don and I talked about, should we adjust the guidance now or should we wait until mid-summer, which is our traditional practice. And our feeling was with the $0.38 first quarter and our knowledge that something dramatic would have to change in the second half of the year to meet the guidance, and the fact is, there's a rhythm to the quarterly earnings in this business, absent some external influence. We felt that it was appropriate to be upfront and direct there with the guidance rather than waiting until July.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, again, historically, and as we said, we're going to earn 47%, 48% in the first half and the remainder in the second half. And there's not enough change in the macro situation to generate that additional earning. There has been these couple of big volume losses that we've experienced here just recently that we have to sort of admit to ourselves. And then there's a couple of decisions that we made to continue to spend appropriately on these other initiatives.","Tod C. Holmes","And then one other thing I'd say on the cost side is the landfill costs are up. We saw a lot of leachate in the Midwest and the Northeast. And one of the questions is \"Well, gee, does that mean that leachate in the second quarter is going to be less?\" Well, it continues to rain in the second quarter and we felt that while that's a onetime item, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to be lower later on. So that's in our guidance also.","Donald W. Slager","Michael, I would just tell you, we tell you what we know when we know it. And that's what we did when we did guidance. We do every year, that's what we're doing now. And then we'll work through it and then we'll keep you informed.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Fisher with Raymond James.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I'll just echo Michael's comments. And I just -- to totally beat the maintenance to death, but I just want to understand the rollout to the facilities, to your major facilities, does that kind of continue to ramp up through the year? I was just trying to understand kind of when that might inflect down. And are you -- will you still be ramping up next year?","Donald W. Slager","Okay. You know what, great question. So the plan as we have it today is that we would impact 40% of our fleet this year, right? It would be landing in the divisions that represent 40% of our trucks, another 30% in '13, another 30% in '14. We may ebb and flow that sort of depending on progress, but that's rough numbers, right? So what we're seeing is kind of a 9-month hill decline there of some additional expense to get to that promised land of scheduled maintenance and so on. And so that's what we're experiencing. And we're seeing that in Q1 and we think that's how it's going to progress throughout the year. So we -- that's it. Within 3 years, we'll be through it. And then we'll be gaining benefit throughout the rollout at some point as these divisions get certified and are operating at a new level of performance, we'll begin to benefit from the productivity gains and so on and so forth. Some of our test divisions that have been through it last year, we've seen the improvement in things like inventory, driver morale, turnover where's a lot of good benefits. Some of them a little softer than others, but that's the cadence we're on.","Tod C. Holmes","And the other thing I would say, Bill, is we're managing the business for the long-term. We know this is the right thing to do. And while it's difficult to swallow, this additional $18 million, $19 million of cost this year, it's important that we stay the course. And we're committed to that.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And  just unrelated though and kind of a  minor thing, but on that -- the 60 basis points of price on that collection side, were you still negative on the residential side?","Tod C. Holmes","$0.06. Price was 30 basis points on the margin. $0.06 of earnings.","Donald W. Slager","I think he's talking about reported [indiscernible].","Tod C. Holmes","Oh, I'm sorry.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Reported price, yes.","Tod C. Holmes","E.","Reported, okay.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So a little color on, like, was residential still negative, just how that was kind of comprised?","Donald W. Slager","Well, a little color, I guess, collection -- total collection's positive. Commercial is still a little negative. Industrial is positive. Residential is actually positive this quarter. So again, landfill again was a bright spot. I know you didn't ask me that, but I'll tell you again, landfill was the 2.6% total or 3.4% for the quarter. So 3.4% total, and MSW was 2.6%. So we had good special waste pricing as well. We had -- not only did we maintain our special waste volumes, but we saw price go up in special waste for the quarter. So that was nice to have.","Operator","And our next question comes from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","On the -- related to the maintenance, I saw there was a small acquisition in the quarter, or at least $20 million, I think, was the cash acquisition price. Is that related to the recycling initiatives? Or what type of -- could you just shed a little color on what are the minor acquisitions?","Tod C. Holmes","No, that was tuck-in acquisitions. We did talk about $65 million of acquisition price and $40 million of revenue through April because we had probably the largest single transaction that we've done this year close on -- it was on, I think, April 2. So what we've been buying this year are tuck-in acquisitions on the hauling side.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, that's right. Again, just to say, we're not -- not to say that all of our acquisitions will be collection or hauling. I mean, we are looking at some other recycling-based infrastructure, et cetera. But so far this year, it's been in collection.","Tod C. Holmes","And  we've got a strong pipeline there. So we are -- again, our original guidance there was $50 million to $100 million of purchase price. We're at about $65 million with a strong pipeline ahead of us.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Is there any pullback from the recycling, multiyear, top 25 market initiatives? Or where are you at in that thought process?","Donald W. Slager","No pullback. Again, we do believe that the waste stream is changing, that customer demand is changing. And I'll just use a minute here to remind everybody. There are some very interesting things that we look at that are very global macro across the whole company. But when we look at investing in the business and recycling, we look very distinctly at the marketplace. And we have 240 distinct, unique markets across Republic Services. And those markets are changing at different speeds. And we're -- it's our job to understand what's changing and the velocity to change. So we have, earmarked again, about 10% of those markets, or 25 markets, that we think we'll invest in over the next 5 years. And it's kind of a dynamic list. There are some things moving up and down in that list of 25. But we're on track to make investments in about 5 markets this year. As I said, we just completed in Q1 the renovation of our Anaheim facility, which will increase our recycling capacity there. Our recycling tons in total are up in Q1, 5% same-store, right? So that is part of the business that's growing. And we can't deny that customer demand is changing, and we need to be in that space so we can provide all those solutions in or around the waste stream that our customers need, and we're committed to doing that.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","On the large national account. I guess when your competitor made the announcement on the acquisition, there was some value or amount that was a so-called potentially-at-risk on revenue. Are we -- have you cleared all of that, what you view at-risk with the definition of value-at-risk as maybe something you know about or something that's coming up for contract negotiation?","Tod C. Holmes","Yes, Al, we've disclosed everything that we know about as far as all these contracts.","Donald W. Slager","Right. As you can appreciate, Al, every year, we enter in a business plan and we have contracts that are being renewed. And we have to look at trends in the business. We've got to look at how far we think we are along in extension negotiations. And we've got to then sort of budget an amount. And we think we're going to retain x% of these customers. We already know we're on the -- well down the path to retain certain ones. Some are more at-risk, and we budget for a certain amount of business loss, business gains, service reduction. We have to obviously take a stab at that. In the case of this large national store, again, we -- as I said, we had a 7-year relationship that we thought was very strong. We've done a lot of good work for the client. And when we put our budget together, we were convinced, frankly, that we're going to extend the business based on the work we've done, and we were wrong. There was something else afoot, and there was somebody with a dramatically different price structure, apparently, than we had. That happens, and that's the nature of that.","Tod C. Holmes","Yes. And the only thing I would say is we've got a very strong pro forma discipline for either bids or acquisitions, which we've applied to this large account. We know what our investment is, we know what the returns are. And with an existing customer, we would want to retain it, so we might stretch there because we know the risks. We know what the waste stream is. But when you get to the point where it becomes a little bit irrational, we have to have a walk away. And that's what we did.","Donald W. Slager","When you're an incumbent, you tend to know all the costs. And so, we still believe in the national accounts' business. We've got a decent pipeline of opportunities, both nationally and regionally, that we're working on. And we've got many, many national account clients that we're working very diligent with on managing their waste stream and so forth. So we're continuing to do the work and it's just, again, as we've said before, it's a competitive business. It always has been, it always will be. And sometimes, a couple of these things take you by surprise.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Then if I may, finally -- sorry for the multiple question part. But on the margin front, EBITDA in particular, given some of these falloffs and walk away from and contract issues, it would suggest given that they were multiyear contracts or relationships, that -- and the lack of volume in the market, that the opportunity for margin expansion beyond even '12 at the moment is going to be something you got your work cut out for you.","Donald W. Slager","Well, we thought -- remember what Don said earlier. We have a whole series of other initiatives that will give us multiyear margin expansion. So when you look at automation, when you look at CNG, when we look at this maintenance initiative, which -- well, it\u2019s a little bit of a headwind, that we'll get over that hurdle. So there are some productivity operating opportunities there and we are continuing to price increase. So some of what we're seeing on the margin is kind of short term in the quarter, which affects the full year. Some are kind of annual in basis or in the maintenance situation, in fuel, it's a little bit longer term. But there are opportunities to expand the margin.","Tod C. Holmes","Sure. Al, I mentioned in my comments, our safety frequency improved by 4.4% again in the quarter. We've deployed more automation. We ended last year at 59% of our resi fleet was automated. Our goal this year is to get it to 63%, I think. Ultimately, we'll get it over 80%. We're going to continue to invest accordingly and that CNG is a good investment for us. Our overall headcount in Q1 was less than it was in Q4. So we are obviously good cost managers. We're tracking those kind of metrics across the business, and the strategy, really, the company hasn't changed, and that's it in a nutshell.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions today and we'll now turn the call back to Mr. Slager for his closing remarks.","Donald W. Slager","Well, thank you, Gabby. In closing, I'd like to thank the entire Republic team for their continued hard work and dedication in the first quarter.

Slager","Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we discuss Republic Services first quarter 2013 performance. I am pleased with our first quarter performance, which reflects an overall improvement in business conditions. We saw sequential increases in core pricing, volume and margins, which drove our strong Q1 results. We continue to profitably grow our core business as evidenced by year-over-year increases in revenue, earnings and free cash flow. Some of the financial and operational highlights during the quarter include: adjusted earnings per share of $0.46, this represents an increase of $0.08 or approximately 21% versus the prior year; adjusted free cash flow of $213 million, which was in line with our expectations; adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points, reflecting the benefit of our field and corporate office reorganization completed in the fourth quarter of 2012; Q1 core price was 1.2%, this represents the third straight quarter of core price improvement; net price-to-customer, defined as price increases less rollbacks, was 3.2% in the first quarter.","Based on Q1 industry results reported to date, our net price-to-customer performance is the highest in the industry. Q1 volumes declined 50 basis points. This represents a sequential improvement of 60 basis points after adjusting for the change in workdays. Consistent with our guidance, we expect to see positive volume performance in the second half 2013.","We continue to see growth in construction and demolition volumes with temporary roll-off hauls up 2.4% over the prior year. And if you remember, 2012 had a very mild winter, which creates a tough comp for this portion of our business.","We continue to see growth in our recycling business. Q1 recycling facility tons increased approximately 8% over the prior year. Additionally, we completed an upgrade to a single-stream recycling facility in St. Louis, which will add about 70,000 annual recycling tons into our system.","We completed 7 acquisitions for approximately $12 million. These transactions were consistent with our strategy of purchasing tuck-in acquisitions in existing markets. This level of investment was expected in the first quarter, and we anticipate completing our goal of spending $100 million by the end of the year.","We returned approximately $161 million to stockholders through share repurchase and dividends. We repurchased 2.4 million shares for $76 million, which was consistent with our plan. We have $248 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete in 2013.","In summary, our strong performance in the first quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to achieve the full year guidance we provided in February. Consistent with prior practice, we will update our full year guidance on our Q2 earnings call in July.","Glenn and Ed will now discuss our financial performance. Glenn?","Glenn A. Culpepper","Thanks, Don. First quarter 2013 revenue was approximately $2 billion and reflects the following 3 components of internal growth: pricing, volume and recycled commodities.","First on pricing. We had core price growth of 1.2% with positive price in all lines of business. Core price increased 10 basis points sequentially from 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012. This level of pricing was in line with our expectations for the first quarter and we remain comfortable with our full year guidance of 1% to 1.5%. In addition, fuel recovery fees increased 0.3%. The average price per gallon of diesel increased to $4.03 in the quarter from $3.97 in the prior year, an increase of 2%.","Second, first quarter volumes decreased 5 -- 0.5% year-over-year, excluding a 50-basis-point decline due to 1 less work day. The collection business was positive, 0.4%, including growth in commercial and industrial volumes. Growth in the industrial line of business was driven by temporary hauls, which as Don indicated earlier, were up 2.4% over the prior year. The growth in collection was offset by a decline in municipal solid waste landfill volumes of approximately 4%. Most of the decline in MSW relates to volumes lost in 2012 that have not yet anniversary-ed and the impact of weather.","Third, a decrease in commodity sales resulted in a 0.2% decrease in revenue. Commodity prices decreased approximately 9% to an average price of $112 per ton in the first quarter from $123 per ton in the prior year. This represents the average price for all commodity types for all regions.","Q1 recycling facility commodity volume of 539,000 tons was up 8% from the prior year. Our 2013 guidance was based on an average commodity price of $112 per ton. For reference purposes, a $10 per ton change in commodity values equals approximately $0.03 of full year EPS, which includes the impact on our recycling facility and collection businesses.","Now I will discuss year-over-year margin. First quarter 2013 adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.5% compared to 28.1% in the prior year, an improvement of 40 basis points. Some of the more significant items that comprise the margin change include: first, labor. The 40 basis point increase in expense primarily relates to revenue mix. There was a decline in landfill and commodity revenues, which have little to no associated labor costs. Within the collection lines of business, direct labor costs as a percentage of revenue remained relatively flat.","Second, maintenance. The 30-basis-point increase in expense primarily relates to the change in revenue mix that I just discussed. Sequentially, margin performance improved 20 basis points as we continued to anniversary the implementation costs associated with our maintenance initiative.","Third, fuel. The 20-basis-point improvement primarily relates to a higher percentage of natural gas trucks in our fleet. Currently, about 9% of our fleet runs on natural gas. This represents an increase in our natural gas fleet of approximately 50% when compared to the prior year. We will continue to replace diesel trucks with the natural gas trucks where appropriate and as part of our normal truck replacement cycle.","As I mentioned earlier, the average price per gallon of diesel increased to $4.03 in the first quarter of 2013 from $3.97 in the prior year, an increase of approximately 2%. The current price for diesel fuel is $3.89 per gallon. Our 2013 guidance is based on an average diesel price of $4.02 per gallon. For reference purposes, a $0.20 change in diesel fuel per gallon is about $0.01 of full year EPS, which includes the impact of our fuel recovery fees and fuel hedges.","Fourth, landfill operating costs, the 80-basis-point increase in expense relates primarily to a favorable adjustment recorded in 2012. Additionally, there was an increase in leachate expense in the current year in certain landfills.","Fifth, risk management. The 20-basis-point improvement relates to reductions in premiums charged by third-party carriers, as well as an improvement in our claims experience.","Next, cost of goods sold. The 10-basis-point improvement relates to a reduction in rebates paid for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold decreased to an average of $32 per ton from $38 in the prior year.","Finally, SG&A. SG&A was 10.3% of revenue, which is an improvement of 90 basis points compared to the prior year. This improvement primarily relates to cost savings from the reorganization of our field operations and corporate office in the fourth quarter of 2012 and lower levels of bad debt expense. On an annual run rate, SG&A is approximately 10% of revenue.","DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, was 11.4% in the first quarter versus 11.8% in the prior year. This improvement relates to an unfavorable landfill liability adjustment that was recorded in the prior year. DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles. Ed will now discuss interest expense, taxes and free cash flow.","Edward A. Lang","Thanks, Glenn. First quarter 2013 interest expense was $89 million, which included $12 million of noncash amortization. First quarter adjusted EPS had an effective tax rate of 33.4%, which included a benefit from favorably settling open tax years with the IRS. This benefit was included in our guidance, which we provided in February. We still expect a full year effective tax rate of approximately 38%. And therefore, our effective tax rate will be approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year.","I will now discuss free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow was $213 million and in line with our expectations. Adjusted free cash flow included capital expenditures of $214 million or approximately 1\/4 of our projected full year spend. Cash flow can vary quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of working capital.","Now I'll discuss the balance sheet. At March 31, our accounts receivable balance was $822 million and our days sales outstanding was 37 days, or 23 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7 billion at March 31. And excess availability under our bank facility was approximately $1.6 billion.","I'll now turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Ed. To conclude, our first quarter results put us right where we thought we would be. I'm proud that the Republic team continued to execute our strategy, and our strong performance reflects our hard work. We built a strong vertically integrated national platform and remained well positioned to take advantage of improving business conditions. We will continue to focus on generating consistent earnings and cash flow growth and remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy that increases returns to our stockholders.","At this time, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Hamzah Mazari, Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just on pricing. Don, maybe you could talk about any change to how you're approaching pricing this year? One of your competitors is obviously out with a more aggressive pricing strategy. And your pricing strategy, maybe you could talk about how you're approaching pricing this year relative to last year and the year before, given that volumes appear to be more stable.","Donald W. Slager","Well, I mean, we're going to adjust or approach pricing the same way we always have, Hamzah, and we've got a good system in place, a good central control over our pricing structure. We talk a lot about our ratable pricing method and how we oversee pricing with our post-collection side of the business. I've said very consistently that I think as the economy returns, as some organic growth comes back into the business that pricing dynamics will improve, I think consumer sentiment improves and sensitivity gets better. I think all of that paves the way for stronger pricing.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just on salaries and allowances for doubtful accounts, that went down, and you mentioned the restructuring. Maybe you could talk about how sustainable that is going forward, and what you have baked into your current guidance?","Donald W. Slager","Well, okay. Well, we've said very clearly, we think our SG&A is going to be right at around 10% and that's been a pretty consistent number for us. Obviously, the more growth we get over time, we can maybe get a little bit of leverage there. But 10% is our number for the year and we -- as far as sustainability goes, the actions we took in the restructuring are very, very sustainable and the organization is functioning very well as a result of restructuring.","Operator","Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Don, this is sort of a broader question, and I'll let you decide how to explain it or answer it. But if I look just at the top line and I look at cost of goods sold, growth rate in sales is below the cost, the full cost of doing business. And you're not alone in that and that several other companies have done that. But specifically, are there things that you're seeing that we should start to expect that sort of relationship to flip around going forward?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. I think, first of all, when we talk about the negative growth or the negative volume in the first half. Remember, we've got some anniversary-ing of some key contracts that were lost or large contracts that were lost last year. So we still believe that we're going to be positive growth in the second half, which sort of nets us to sort of flat, flattish, by the end of the year, but we think the business is growing. We talked about sequential improvement in pricing now for several quarters. We got a pretty positive story on the collection side of the business and we've got -- our landfill business is negative. But again, that's coming from a couple of large contracts and maybe a little bit of weather that we're facing. Overall, we think the trends are positive. So sequential pricing improvement is a good thing. As I just answered Hamzah's question, as some organic growth comes back into the business, we think those dynamics around pricing and our ability to improve or recover, if you will, the inflationary cost get better as we go through time.","Edward A. Lang","And Al, this is Ed. Also keep in mind that as you start to see positive volume growth that does lead to better density, better asset utilization, which means you're just simply getting better return on the existing asset base so -- and as Don mentioned, that's something we've been talking about quite a while, due to the late cycle nature of the business, that as we start to see the volume improvement, we get the better asset utilization, which will lead to expanding margins and a less competitive pricing environment as the industry continues to grow.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And then my follow-up would be -- we've talked a little bit about this previously, but just to be clear, the number of strikes or labor issues that have been popping up in the press, I think you called out in the reconciliation some of that. Maybe it would be good idea to just to clarify for folks sort of where you're at in terms of the frequency of these that are showing up in the press. I'd like to refer to it as sort of drive-by strikes because they're not very long duration, but they're certainly a headwind.","Donald W. Slager","Right, sure. Well, the issue we're facing right now is primarily related to the Central States Pension issue. And so we've got a portion of our business, a number of our drivers that are covered by the Central States Pension, which is headed for insolvency. There's no way mathematically for that fund to save itself. And so we are in the process of negotiating our way out of the Central States Pension. We have every intention of getting out of the pension. We have a very strong feeling that we want all of our employees to be covered by a high quality retirement vehicle. And being part of a pension plan that's going to be insolvent in the future is not that. So we're working hard for our employees to get them into something that makes sense for them. We're about halfway through the number of CBAs that are affected by Central States, and we're working through the second half. So we hope to be through that by the end of the year. Having said all that, we historically have had a very good relationship, a very constructive relationship, with the local unions and their leadership. We intend to continue to have that and we continue to bargain in good faith to get through this.","Operator","Corey Greendale, First Analysis.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","A question on -- I think Don, you gave a statistic net price, net of rollbacks, where you said you're leading the industry. And I'm not sure I exactly know how you're calculating that. But if you are leading the industry, I think it was about a year ago, you were talking about fiercely defending your business. So it seems like kind of things have shifted from then. To what do you attribute that kind of industry-leading metric?","Donald W. Slager","Well, again, price-to-customer, if you will, really measures the pricing activity of your business. So what do you think price elasticity is in the market and how much price increase do you think you can capture in the marketplace. So that metric of price-to-customer, less rollbacks kind of measures that activity. There's a lot of noise in the market about yield versus -- so I think all of the companies sort of measure price differently. And so we just tried to bring a clearer view to that so that you can compare pricing effectiveness of the different organizations. So we've introduced this price-to-customer metric to help me [ph] clear that up. So again, we think -- again, our pricing activity is pretty consistent. We cannot completely make up for inflationary increases just through cost controls and productivity gains. So we have to have price increasing to offset that. We've never gone price negative even through the darkest times of recent economic downturn. And we've said that as the economy gets better, as organic growth improves, as other competitors have an opportunity to grow their business organically, we think competition regulates or moderates a little bit. It's always been a competitive business, it always will be a competitive business. We think it just softens a little bit and customer sentiment, as I said before, just improves. So we think a lot of that is happening and we're going to continue doing what we have to do because we cannot simply, again, offset our cost inflation through our productivity gains. So pricing has to happen in our company and I think in the industry to continue to hold up margins and grow the business profitably.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","And on the productivity gains side, Don, you -- at one time you talked about kind of a parking lot of opportunities to improve efficiencies after some of the big ticket items after the Republic-Allied merger. Could you just give us visibility on kind of where you're at -- how big is that parking lot now? And is there anything kind of meaningfully you're working on that we could be seeing in the near-term?","Donald W. Slager","That's a good question. Corey, we're working on the same things we were working last year. Again, we've got 30,000 employees, 15,000 trucks, 800 dots on the map, right? So when we take on some kind of a change initiative across the enterprise, it's a pretty big deal. And a change in management is a pretty tough thing for people. So things like the One Fleet initiative, we'll be halfway through that by the end of this year. We'll have affected half of our fleet, so we've got another couple years ago. Again, when we get into next year, we'll start seeing more benefits accrue from the One Fleet initiative. We'll start to offset some of the costs of implementing One Fleet. One Fleet is going to drive better productivity, better employee engagement, ultimately, I think better customer experience. So we'll start to see the benefits from that in -- the benefits from that in '14. And then we'll build as we complete the initiative. We've talked about CNG. We're continuing to spend, I think, this year 40-plus percent of our fleet spend is on CNG trucks. We're -- we've talked about building our fleet up to, maybe, 25% or 30% CNG over the future years. That's going to be, again, a multiyear initiative. So we've got a number of those things that were in the parking lot at the time of the merger that we've undertaken that are multiyear initiatives. So none of these things happen fast. When we get through these couple of big items, then we'll be talking about what we conquer next. But we're going to do these things really well, we're do them across the enterprise and we're going to do them with results that we can count.","Operator","Next question, Adam Thalhimer, BB&T.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","In terms of the C&D volumes, you said they were up a little over 2% year-over-year in the quarter and that maybe weather held that growth back a little bit. I mean as this housing recovery matures, what kind of growth rates do you think you might see in that line of business?","Edward A. Lang","Well, you kind of look at what we saw starting the third quarter of last year. In Q3 of last year we saw the temporary roll-off business grow by 3.8% and it was 5.7% in Q4, 2.4% in Q1. And as we mentioned in the comments, 2 things, one, we had some real winter weather this year and I think, when you look at our business regionally, we did see a strong performance in that temporary roll-off business on the Western states, Texas, in the southeastern U.S., which obviously are the geographic locations that were less impacted by the severe winter weather that we saw in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. So we don't really provide detailed guidance as to percentage quarterly gain, but we believe it is tracking in the right direction. And then the other thing is just as a comparison issue, if you look at Q1 of '12, it was an exceptionally warm winter. And I think if you go back and you look at the industry's performance in Q1 of '12, you saw a fairly, let's call it, elevated levels of C&D activity, which actually turned out to be just a pull forward of the normal Q2 activity in 2012. And so the fact that we did have that 2.4%, given the weather conditions in the Midwest and the Eastern states, plus the tough comp, we think the 2.4% is good-to-strong performance. And we expect the C&D business to continue to grow with the relative economies where we do business. And obviously, you look at all the housing stats and the architects\u2019 index, all those type of leading indicators are pointing in the right direction.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, 3 quarters in a row, I think that's a real trend and we'll build on that from here.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Yes, I mean, what does that feel like on the ground? I mean, is there less capacity in that business? Are you -- are people -- are you getting more calls for containers? I mean, does it feel more active to you?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, it's more active. I mean, these -- the 2.4%, those are measured in hauls, right? So those are actual hauls being serviced by our fleets in the various markets that I talked about. A little more active the west, southeast, Florida specifically. A little less active in some of the markets where we have winter. And as we get into May and June, that's where we start to see seasonality in the business and that's going to be the telltale sign for us, to see how the year comes in.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up here, I mean, the expectation that volumes turn positive in the back half of the year, is that all easier comps or are there some leading indicators in the business that would support that?","Donald W. Slager","That's mostly easier comps. We anniversary a couple of big contracts that we lost that we had to talk about a year ago. And we haven't had any continued contract loss of that size. So we're going to anniversary those biggies and then we're going to get into a better comp in the last half of the year. But then as Ed said, these other trends are improving. So we're pretty confident in the guidance we've given you.","Operator","Next question, Michael Hoffman, Wunderlich.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Can we talk a little bit about sort of maybe putting a little sort of direction around the productivity? And I get the One Fleet, the CNG conversion, probably could be added to that is automation. If you thought about natural inflation in the business is sort of 1.5% to 2%, and we're living in this economy, whatever this is, this is the economy for a while. What do you think you can do in productivity to help offset that natural inflation, plus sort of that continual turning the screw on cost? What's the basis point kind of range to think about, so that when we think about your pricing at 1.5%, how that sort of plays out?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, I think historically, we've said it's kind of 20 to 30 basis points, right, a year. So less than 1%, certainly, right? So we've been at this a long time, Michael, we're pretty productive and so we're working at the harder things now. Again, CNG makes sense to us because we're replacing trucks that are going to be otherwise disposed of. So we're pacing ourselves there. The One Fleet, we're in the process now wherein where that's still costing us a little bit of money and we start to come over the top of that hill on that next year. Things like single operator vehicles, the automation, we continue to reduce our workforce in that residential system, become more efficient with fewer accidents, so all of that stuff helps productivity so -- but we're pretty good at what we do and it's not like there's a lot of low-hanging fruit out there. So if we get back to, again, 1.5% or 2% pricing, and we have 1.5% inflation less, call it 20 or 30 basis points of productivity, we can start to see a little bit of margin expansion again as it relates to that pricing environment.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the household formation sort of the construction, I mean, we all love the C&D, but the real play is, not only do they build it, but they sell it and you get a residential contract. And if they build enough of them and sell enough of them, maybe somebody builds a restaurant or a strip mall. So can you frame 2 things here, one, what are you seeing as far as that starting -- is there a light at the end of that tunnel? What's the sort of thoughts about that? And if it got to 1.2 million starts a year and lapped ourselves at 1.2 million, what's that mean in volume in your mind?","Donald W. Slager","Well, we're talking about 2013. So I think we'd rather kind of stick with the guidance that we're talking about for this year. Again, as you know, Michael, we're late cycle in this. So it's too early, I think, to tell or talk about business formation. We're not really seeing a lot there yet. So we're in the front end of this thing, starting to see more temporary roll-off hauls. We'll see more construction. You hear the homebuilders talking about what they're going to do. So we'll make those hauls, to your point, then we'll haul that house every month for the recurring revenue and we'll take our part of the -- our share of new organic growth in business formation. That's our bread and butter. So I think after a very sort of long dark period in the industry, where we've seen a pretty tough volume situation and a pretty low pricing environment, I think the trends are that we're coming out of this thing and we've got some real trends sequentially to be happy with and celebrate. And we've got to pace ourselves because I don't things are going to come back quickly, we just want it to come back steadily. And I think that's what's going to happen.","Operator","Next question, Alex Ovshey, Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, can you talk about how the business is trending so far in April and any notable tidbits to highlight for us thus far in April?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, Alex, we're kind of trying to stick to Q1. And talk about what we've done in the quarter and again, be consistent with our practice of reiterating our guidance for the full year. We think, as I just got done saying with -- to Michael, the trends are good. We think they're sustainable and we're on track to meet our guidance and have a good year. So I think you can read between all that and kind of come to your own conclusion.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right, that's all right. And then on the commodity side, do you have any incremental insight on OCC pricing, recycled paper pricing and thoughts on the Green Fence initiative and the implications from that on the commodity price environment?","Edward A. Lang","Well, as far as operation Green Fence, I think what we've tried to do there is work with our various buyers so that they can conduct inspections in the U.S. so -- that doesn't get held up at port. But there is a bit of a bottleneck. It's hard to forecast as to exactly how that will impact OCC pricing during the course of the full year. But I would tell you, we're doing whatever we can to, let's call it, expedite the shipment of the materials which we're sending to the export markets. If you just look at the blended OCC price during the first quarter, it was trending up slightly month-to-month, averaged about $122 for the full quarter. So I think it's a good pricing environment for OCC. But, yes, we're not really at the type of levels we saw in 2010 or for the first few quarters of 2011. But it's an improving market, but we'll just continue to work with our buyers to minimize some of the delays with operation Green Fence.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just one more quick question, did you guys tell us what your C&D volume to landfill was in the quarter? What that change was?","Edward A. Lang","It was down slightly in the year-over-year kind of mid-single digits. Right, and the reason for the variance was, we had 2 significant C&D landfill jobs in the first quarter of 2012 that obviously didn't occur. So really most of the negative variance was the comp related to those 2 jobs.","Operator","Next question, Stewart Scharf, S&P Capital.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research","Can you talk a little bit about where you are with shale waste?","Donald W. Slager","Well, sure. We're in the solid waste landfill business and so we do accept material E&P, drilling mud, et cetera, as part of our special waste stream in the landfills that are situated in and around where that drilling activity is occurring. And our E&P business, if you will, is really related just to that activity alone. We don't have other site services along that business like other companies in our space have. So on a year-over-year comp basis, that business, relatively flat for us, consistent but flat.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research","Okay. And now regarding your guidance, you kept it the same. First quarter was strong, you're looking for well-controlled costs and sequential growth and pick-up in volume, are you being just a little conservative at this point or do you think that you might be closer to the high-end?","Donald W. Slager","No, just as I said, we're reiterating our guidance and it's 1 quarter in. Our Q2s and Q3 are the strongest quarters of the year. So as I said previously, as we start to see what seasonality does for us in the months of May and June, we'll be able to tell a little bit more in July. But we feel good about the trends, we feel really good about the conditions we're seeing in the markets. We feel good about what our people are doing to move the business forward and we'll talk more about where we think we're going to be at the end of June when we talk to you in July.","Operator","Barbara Noverini, Morningstar.","Barbara Noverini - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask about the recycling rebate COGS coming down. Is this mainly a function of the commodity values themselves being lower recently? Or have you also been able to negotiate more favorable terms with your customers as contracts come up for renewal? I'd assume that as you've grown recycling capability over time, you've also learned about the most optimal way to structure these arrangements?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. It's mostly just what you said, it's the rates adjusting. We -- as we get size, as we get scale, we get a little better at running the business, but we already have some pretty good contractual arrangements with selling the material to the right end markets. We've got a pretty good core competency here and in doing that. So it's just really mostly related to the rates going up and down.","Operator","Jeff Osborne, Stifel.","Jeffrey D. Osborne - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions from my end. I was just wondering, in the past call or 2, you've talked about the potential privatization of municipal landfills and taking those over. Just given the challenging municipal backdrop, was that a part of any of the M&A you did this quarter or something that's still on the potential radar for you folks?","Donald W. Slager","It's on our radar. We are focusing on it. We recently announced the Flint, Michigan, contract that we privatized -- or that the city chose to outsource. So we announced that earlier in the year, I think February. So we're going to continue to look at that. We do believe that again the general fund in many cities is under duress and the same situation there that's creating pricing pressure for us is also creating some opportunity for us to talk to cities about the possibility and the opportunity, frankly, to outsource that service to us. So we're going to continue to focus on it. As I've said in the past, we've got a pipeline of opportunity there, but these are very long sales cycles and they're very complex sales and they're very sort of political in nature. So it takes a while to get that done.","Jeffrey D. Osborne - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Understand. And then 2 other quick ones here. Is there kind of a magic price of natural gas in your mind where you would slow down or stop altogether your CNG conversion? Or are you just committed to it despite some of the higher prices that we've seen in recent months?","Donald W. Slager","Well, yes, I'll let Ed talk a little bit more about the specifics but we would -- we believe that right now, it's a very economical alternative for us, as well being good for the environment. But to stop altogether, that would be a pretty dramatic change in, I think, the pricing situation there. So Ed, why don't you give us some color on that?","Edward A. Lang","Sure. If you kind of look at what we're paying for natural gas versus diesel today, and looking at our actual performance in the first quarter, what we're benefiting today on the CNG conversion is a gallon cost differential of $2.13. And that benefit of $2.13 cost savings does not include the $0.50 per gallon tax credit, which we'll receive in 2013. Now that was a one-time item as far as the tax credit. So obviously we look at that separately and don't include it in the net cost differential between diesel and CNG.","Jeffrey D. Osborne - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got you, Ed. And then the last question just bigger picture with the discipline that the industry has had over the past 2 to 3 quarters on the pricing front, and with volumes starting to improve, is churn getting better, worse, how do we think about that for maybe either yourselves or your perception of the industry would be helpful?","Donald W. Slager","Well, a couple of things, just definition, all right? When we talk about churn, we're talking about the difference between what we sell a new unit of service at versus what we lose when we lose a customer, what is that price per unit of service? So that churn, that difference in price is pretty consistent, pretty flat, okay? We talk about defection, that's a separate matter. That's how much business we lose and that's pretty flat and that's about 7%. So it's about 7% of our business, we lose on an annual basis. A little more than half of that is competitive and some of that is structural, call it, bankruptcies. It's been a pretty consistent number for us for several years. We think, overall, the business is stable. But as I said before, it's always been a competitive business, it always will be, it's a very local business in that way. But as organic growth improves, we think all competitors just feel better about their business and become sort of less or more rational, if you will, in their practices. And we think customers, frankly, just are less sensitive to an extra percent of price. So we think just the overall improving economy is going to drive that for us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question, Joe Box, KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the CapEx front. I know you said earlier that it came in line with expectations. But with it being down year-over-year, can you maybe give us a flavor of where you cut back and how we should think about it trending over the next couple of quarters?","Donald W. Slager","Yes. We really haven't cut back. I mean, it's -- the only thing that I think is different this year over last year is we've reduced our overall spending in a recycling development, and that is because it's a little bit lumpy. We did some bigger projects last year in total than we did this year. So we're doing the same sort of number of projects, last year's were bigger. And we said we're going to spend -- or we're going to do 3 to 5 markets per year as far as our infrastructure build-out or enhancements in recycling. We've stayed true to that, we're going to continue to do it. Again as you can see -- or as you can understand, it's a little bit lumpy. As far as truck spending, it's very consistent. We've got a very young fleet. We replace a very consistent number of trucks every year. About 30% of our total CapEx goes to sell [ph] development. We've got to dig those landfills to fill them up, and so that's pretty consistent. We manage our CapEx generally in line with about 10% of our revenues and we've historically done that as I -- consistently as far back as I can remember. So I don't see that really changing much.","Edward A. Lang","And Joe, just to reiterate the guidance, the net CapEx, which is gross CapEx of $860 million, less $25 million of proceeds from asset sales, that number is $835 million. The guidance for net CapEx for the full year is $835 million and we did spend $214 million in Q1. So I would say, we're just simply tracking right on our plan with almost exactly 25% of the spend occurring in Q1.","Donald W. Slager","Yes, and Joe, sometimes there are timing differences with when we get the trucks in or when -- depending on when contracts start. So that ebbs and flows a little bit. But we're really right where we thought we'd be.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Perfect. That's helpful. And then, Don, you mentioned earlier that you guys are out doing all you can to basically drive pricing. One of your peers is out basically looking to introduce a regulation fee and some other fees out there to maintain the price cost breakdown. Can you just give us some historical context. When a waste player comes out and introduces a one-time true-up fee, is that something that typically other peers come out and follow suit with or is it more of a one-off thing?","Donald W. Slager","Okay, here's what I would say, Joe, we are constantly reviewing our costs, constantly reviewing the market and looking to recover cost increases through pricing. So we've recently reviewed our fee recovery fee and made sure that, that made sense for the company and was fair to our customers. We think it's the right amount for us today. We, from time to time, look at our environmental fees and look at what it takes to run these landfills. A number of years ago, the EPA passed some legislation that drove our air quality testing cost of about $3 million, and we chose to pass it along to our customers through an environmental fee. So that's how we look at our business. This is a very capital-intensive business. These landfills are very, very expensive to own and to operate and they're long-life assets with lots of liability. And we've always got to make sure that we're getting the right price for those assets and we look at that on an ongoing basis, really, year in and year out.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Understood. Just a housekeeping item for you then. If you look at the repurchase versus the option issuance this quarter, it looks like it was about a push. Should we think about the buyback having more of an effect in the share count in the coming quarters? How should we think about that?","Edward A. Lang","Well, obviously, Joe, we have a plan for share repurchase this year. Coming into the year, we had about $325 million. Obviously, we used probably about 1\/4 of that in Q1. So again, we're tracking right on plan with the use of cash for repurchase. When you talk about option dilution, that's a little bit hard to forecast, and so we really don't have that in the number. There was some option exercise in Q1 that did impact the share count, which we did offset with share repurchase. But I don't think you can really forecast option exercise during the course of the year.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I mean, no commentary on how that could trend directionally?","Edward A. Lang","No. Because, again, we don't really forecast the -- that's an individual decision as to when to do that.","Operator","That's all the time we do have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Slager for his closing remarks.","Donald W. Slager","Thank you, operator.

Good afternoon, Mr. DelGhiaccio.","Brian M. DelGhiaccio - Senior VP-Finance & Head-Investor Relations","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. This is Brian DelGhiaccio and I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services' second quarter 2015 conference call. Don Slager, our CEO, and Chuck Serianni, our CFO, are joining me as we discuss our performance.","Before we get started, I would like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information we discuss on today's call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties and may be materially different from actual results. Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","The material that we discuss today is time-sensitive.

And finally, I want to remind you that Republic's management team routinely participates in investor conferences. When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website, along with instructions for listening to the live webcast of the events.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Republic team continued our strong start to the year and delivered another solid quarter. We achieved higher levels of core price and average yield, profitably increased volumes, made continued progress against our multiyear initiatives, and reported earnings and free cash flow growth. We continue to see positive momentum in our business from successfully executing our strategy and a steady improvement in solid waste trends.","Some of our second quarter and year-to-date highlights include: second quarter EPS was $0.54; the second quarter benefited approximately $0.03 due to a lower tax rate; year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $410 million, which was in line with our expectations; second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3%, which was consistent with the prior year and our full-year guidance; core price in the second quarter was 3.8% and average yield was 2.4%.","The sequential improvement in yield performance reflects an increase in the level of pricing, a favorable reduction in rollbacks, and an improvement in the impact from churn. Each of these components of average yield has benefited from our revenue enhancing initiatives. This is the second straight quarter of reporting average yield in excess of 2% while growing volumes in excess of 1%, which clearly demonstrates our ability to grow both price and volume simultaneously. Second quarter volumes increased 1.1%, which was broad-based geographically and included positive contribution from our collection and disposal lines of business.","The year-to-date investment in solid waste acquisitions was $116 million. This includes our normal tuck-in transactions and approximately $80 million of consideration for a life-of-site agreement to operate the Sonoma County landfill and transfer station network. We commenced operations of Sonoma County on April 1 of this year. The integration of Tervita is going well and on track with our plan. Performance has been short of our original expectations due to a sharper decline in the rig counts and drilling activity, but we remain pleased with the people and the quality of the assets. We are well positioned to take advantage of a recovery in this business.","As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned approximately $400 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 5.1 million shares repurchased for $205 million. We have $155 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization, which intend to complete during 2015. Additionally, our board recently raised the quarterly dividend to $0.30, an increase of approximately 7%.","We continue to make progress on our multiyear initiatives that enable us to execute our strategy. These initiatives are designed to profitably growth our business, enhance the customer experience, further differentiate our service offerings, and reduce costs. Regarding our revenue enhancing initiatives, all of our markets are using our capture pricing tool. 75% or our sales force has been trained on priority-based selling, or PBS. We expect PBS to be fully rolled out by the end of the year. Nearly one million customers has enrolled in the My Resource customer portal and app. And finally, we have approximately 350 contracts with more than $150 million in annual revenue that now use an alternative index for the annual price adjustment.","We continue to educate municipalities and expand the use of indices that more closely align with our cost structure. Regarding our fleet, 15% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas, 70% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 70% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet maintenance program.","With respect to our recycling business, average recycle commodity prices remain below the 10-year average, which continues to put pressure on our results. Most of our recycling business is performed on behalf of our municipal customers under multiyear contracts. As these contracts come to term, we are focused on renegotiating terms that contain the elements most important to us, including increasing processing and service fees that allow us to recover our costs and earn a reasonable return, and implementing a commodity revenue share mechanism that fluctuates with commodity markets, but also incentivizes customers to send us clean and valuable material.","We expect it will take several years to realize the full impact of our efforts, given the long term nature of these recycling contracts. In the open market, where we do not have the same contractual limitations, we have already taken the following three actions: first, we increased rates charged for recycling collection services to be more in line with solid waste services; second, we increased amounts charged for processing materials at our recycling facilities; and finally, we adjusted the rebates paid to third parties for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. We believe that improving the profitability of the recycling business ensures its sustainability, which benefits the environment, our shareholders, our customers, and the communities we serve.","In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date results. We are raising our full-year financial guidance as follows, based on our expected outperformance for the year. We now expect diluted EPS to be in a range of $2.02 to $2.05; our original guidance was $1.98 to $2.04. We now expect adjusted free cash flow to be in a range of $720 million to $745 million; our original guidance was $710 million to $740 million.","Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Don. Second quarter 2015 revenue was approximately $2.3 billion, an increase of $82 million over the prior year. This 3.7% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 1% and acquisitions of 2.7%. The components of internal growth are as follows: first, average yield growth of 2.4%. Average yield in the collection business was 2.9%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small container commercial business, 4.4% yield in the large container industrial business, and 1% yield in the residential business. Average yield in the post-collection business was 0.9%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.4%. Core price, which measures price increases net of rollbacks, was 3.8%. Core price consisted of 4.8% in the open market and 1.9% in the restricted portion of our business.","Second, our volumes increased 1.1% year-over-year. The collection business increased 1.3%, which includes positive contribution from the commercial business of 0.5%, the industrial business of 1.9%, and the residential business of 1.8%. Our commercial volume performance of 0.5% includes a 30-basis-point decline due to not renewing select national accounts customers and work performed on behalf of brokers. We view these losses as non-regrettable.","The post-collection business, made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes, increased 0.6%. Landfill was up 0.9%, which includes positive contribution from MSW of 4% and C&D of 1.9%, partially offset by a decline in special waste of 2.1%. Special waste volumes were up 0.8% excluding the decrease in same-store E&P waste streams. The sequential decline in our volume performance from the first quarter was expected, since we had a tougher comparison in the prior period.","Next, fuel recovery fees decreased 150 basis points. The change relates to a decline in the cost of fuel, which decreased approximately $33 million compared to the prior year. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.85 in the second quarter from $3.94 in the prior year, a decrease of 28%. The current average diesel price is $2.78 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel costs through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally, 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges. At current participation levels, a $0.20 per gallon change in diesel results in a $1 million change in annual operating income.","Finally, commodity revenue decreased 100 basis points. The decrease in commodity sales primarily relates to a decrease in recycled commodity prices. Commodity prices at our recycling facilities decreased 11% to an average price of $97 per ton in the second quarter, from $109 per ton in the prior year. June commodity prices were approximately $100 per ton.","Second quarter recycling volume of 655,000 tons represents an increase of approximately 5% from the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, volumes were down approximately 6%. Cost of goods sold for recycled commodities decreased $3 million compared to the prior year, a decrease of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Overall, we've experienced greater than anticipated headwinds from our recycling business, primarily due to recycling collection.","Within recycling collection we are receiving less than anticipated rebates for materials delivered to third-party facilities. The lower rebates, which are recorded as part of our recycled commodity revenue, reduced second quarter EPS by approximately $0.01 compared to our original expectations. We recognized this headwind and implemented additional price increases in the open market to help mitigate the impact. This pricing action explains some of the sequential increase in core price and average yields compared to our first quarter results. Our material recycling facilities performed in line with our expectations.","Now I will discuss changes in margin. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3%, which was consistent with the prior year. Margin expansion from the solid waste business, which includes lower fuel cost, was offset by the impact of lower recycled commodity prices and E&P waste services. Our E&P waste business includes transition and integration costs from our recent acquisition of Tervita.","There was a 250 basis point reduction in revenue due to a decline in fuel recovery fees and lower recycled commodity prices. As a result, certain cost line items increased as a percentage of revenue. This was most prominent in the larger cost categories. For example, the decline in fuel recovery fees in commodity revenue resulted at an increase in labor of 40 basis points, in maintenance of 20 basis points, and in SG&A expenses of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The remaining increases in these three cost categories primarily relate to the mix of volume growth and integration costs. I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing.","Second quarter 2015 interest expense was $92 million, which includes $12 million of non-cash amortization. Our effective tax rate was 36.3% in the second quarter and 37.8% on a year-to-date basis. The lower tax rate in the second quarter reflects a $0.03 benefit from favorably settling certain tax matters. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% in the second half of the year. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $410 million and in line with our expectations. Cash flow can vary quarter-to-quarter based upon the timing of cash taxes and working capital. Now I'll turn the call back over to Don.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks Chuck. In closing, we continue to see a broad and sustained recovery in our solid waste business. Improving fundamentals, together with solid operational execution, have resulted in EPS and free cash flow growth and margin expansion.","I am proud of how we continue to execute our business plan, and our strong performance reflects the hard work from the entire Republic team. We continue to manage the business to create long-term value and remain focused on executing our strategy.","At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. First question will come from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon guys.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Tyler.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, so Chuck, you kind of hit on this, but it looks like the overall EBITDA margins were roughly flat if you take in totality, and I guess that doesn't really jive with the 2.4% average yield. You know, I would expect to see some margin expansion with pricing over 2%, especially when you are growing volumes and fuel falling. My hunch is that Tervita kind of mixed away some of the good things in core solid waste. Is there any way that you could isolate or give us some numbers around what the core solid waste margins did?","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, sure Tyler. So quarter-over-quarter, solid waste, which includes yield obviously, was up about 60 basis points, so very solid growth from that portion of the business. You know recycling, as we have talked about, was a headwind of about 30 basis points. And then E&P, obviously Tervita, including integration costs, is a negative about 30 basis points, and that's what gets you to kind of flat year-over-year.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Excellent, very good. And then I also, I kind of want to \u2013 I get it that about 50% of your market is in the restricted piece, and let's call it 50% in the open, and I know 60% of the restricted is in CPI, but actually I want to ask about the other 40% that isn't tied directly in with CPI, but it is \"restricted.\" So can you kind of help us understand what we should expect core pricing trends to be in that bucket as we move out to 2016, and what really moves that piece of the business?","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right, so let's put the pieces together, right? So half of our revenue is restricted, half of it is open market. Of the restricted piece, we say 60% of that is tied to some kind of an index, right? We will come back to that. The rest that's restricted is, it might be a fixed price increase, it might be not tied to an index but have a 2%, 3%, 4% increase already built into the contract. And those might be large industrial accounts, they could be national accounts, things like that. So you know, what moves the pricing in that part of the business is just our further commitment to pricing intelligently our business and knowing when to walk away from business.","You know we mentioned, Chuck mentioned in his results that \u2013 or in his comments that one of the things that impacted volume was some loss of some national account business and some broker business that we define as non-regrettable. So, you know, we're going to continue to look at business, and all customers aren't created equally. So the capture tool, the PBS training that we talked about, all those things are proving valuable throughout our business, we are going to continue to move price. We think now with what we've been seeing that price for the full year will be closer to 2% based on all of these actions.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, perfect. So that restricted piece that's not tied to CPI doesn't necessarily move in sympathy with CPI, its actually fairly independent? Okay.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It is somewhat independent, and again there are many different versions of contracts within that bucket, but we're basically taking our same sort of core philosophy on pricing throughout our business.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Levine with Imperial Capital. Your line is open.","Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay, good afternoon guys.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Scott.","Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC","So I guess you mentioned use of these revenue enhancing initiatives kind of driving some of your ability to get price and volume and better rate than you guys have I think over the last few years. I was hoping you might to be able to elaborate on that a bit more. The pricing metrics in particular over the last couple quarters have been surprisingly good. Is there anything going on in the marketplace that is driving this, or is it more internal in your opinion?","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think there's a lot going on. Let's talk first about our efforts, right? So we have put an incredible focus on customer experience, on service delivery, on our fleet initiatives, so our fleet is more reliable today, our customer delivery is better, we think we're extending customer loyalty, and we think we're earning that price increase more easily from our customers. So that's at work. I think we are easier to do business with than we were a year and two years ago. So we are increasing the value proposition, that's part of it.","We are going out with higher price increases. We've got more confidence in earning that price increase, or asking for little higher price in the open market and getting it. Specifically also on the recycling business in the open market, with the way that recycling commodity prices dropped pretty quickly in the first half of the year, we went right to work on pricing that open market recycling business, and as we said in our comments, we've moved the prices up substantially in that segment. So that's driving it.","Certainly when there is volume growth in the marketplace, market dynamics change. Generally speaking, I think competition is less likely to go out aggressively for competitive waste streams when they are getting waste streams organically. So I think that's happening, I think that's just sort of normal supply and demand kind of activity that happens in a marketplace.","We are using our tools, right? So capture is rolled out to all of our areas across the country. That gives us \u2013 it makes us more efficient in talking to customers and calling on new accounts, it makes the selling process better and more desirable and enjoyable for our customers, and it gives us better pricing control at that point of decision. So that's happening, that's helping affect churn. And then PBS, tied to that training, we're also have refined our sales compensation plans, et cetera. So there's a lot of work inside the company that's doing that. Again, a normal growth environment organically would be a better market to get price in.","And then obviously on the municipal side of the business, we talked about moving a portion of that business to the better index, and so every quarter now we've reported an increase in moving more customers to the new index that's more in line with our cost structure. We are going to continue that hard work, and over time we will move the needle consistently and basically kind of re-imagine how we price municipal customers, because we have to have an index that's fair. So it's a mouthful, but all those things working together for the greater good here.","Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC","Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. And as my follow up, I guess here, so, with the dividend hike I have that equating to about, I don't know, 55% to 60% of your free cash flow target for this year. I know you are buying back stock so that share base comes down, but you know that, coupled with the fact that you guys are spending little bit more on acquisitions last year and on pace to do so again this year, is there any thought we should have in terms of what kind of guides the thought process on the dividend, which I know is a board decision, but are you guys comfortable? I don't know where the leverage sits today, but maybe just a little bit more color around that?","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know, we are certainly comfortable with the leverage where it's at today. And you know, keep in mind also that we are going to be growing the EBITDA of the company. When we think about dividend growth, we think about growing dividends in line with our growth in free cash flow, so that's something that's very, very comfortable for us. You know, a 7% growth in the dividend this quarter is right in line with our five-year CAGR, and it's obviously something that we are all very comfortable with, that the board's very comfortable with.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Scott, we expect the leverage to continue to drop through the course of the year to sub-three. We anniversary some events, the business continues to perform and grow as Chuck said, so we are very comfortable with the leverage. And we do a very in-depth discussion with our board every year on our financial policies and cash allocation. We had a very big discussion with our board this week on the dividend. We always had that kind of holistic view of cash for acquisitions, cash for dividend and for buyback. And so we'll continue to do that, and we think this is right sort of balanced approach to efficiently return cash to shareholders. And the question was do we have confidence; we wouldn't have done if we didn't have confidence in it.","Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much for taking my questions Don, Chuck and Brian.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Michael.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi guys. On the operating leverage of the business, when I think about Chuck's comment that there was 60 basis points of leverage on solid waste but it's offset by 60 basis points from recycling E&P, how do I think about that tracking into the second half? Is the 60 on the E&P and recycling kind of going to be a constant, but the solid waste should have some acceleration, maybe running towards 100 basis points?","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's going to be relatively consistent, Michael, over the course of the remainder of the year. I don't see the headwind \u2013 we are not forecasting the headwind in recycling to go away anytime soon, and we're certainly not calling for an upturn in oil rigs. We don't see that anytime real soon. So I think that that headwind's going to consist \u2013 stay consistent. I would also say that we feel very comfortable with the increase in solid waste, and we think that we're going to continue to benefit from the initiatives that Don had talked about, as well as our continued focus in on driving up our yield.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so Michael I'll add to that. I look at that as upside, right? Because the underlying business, the majority of our business, our solid waste business, is performing very well, and we've got these two components, right? Recycling is 9% of our revenue, commodity sales is about half of that 9%, and then our E&P business is less than 2% of our overall business. So we've got these two sort of micro verticals here that you know are fairly volatile. But we are confident that they'll return; we're bringing more focus to the recycling space than we ever have. So as we get those businesses to come around and the broader macro environment improves, that's just sort of added fuel to an already very well operating and performing core business.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, so just so I make sure I understood it \u2013 this isn't my second question, operator...","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, I think it is, Michael.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Then, well just so I \u2013 so the 60 stays 60 as the headwind, 3Q, 4Q, but the 60 that was solid waste should improve \u2013 maybe it's 70, 80; 80 goes to 90, 100, 3Q, 4Q, that's the way to think about it based on what you all have just said?","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, well if you think about it, one of the big points of \u2013 that when Chuck mentioned the headwind from E&P integration, some of the integration cost is going to taper down, right? And then obviously as you know, you've followed this business a long time, there's a lot of moving parts in mix, geographical, business mix, some of the cycles of pricing, and as we said, we expect pricing to be more like 2% for the full year now. But yeah, I mean it's \u2013 we think the underlying performance of the business improves from here. And we've got to continue to do same things we've been doing. We've got to continue to have success in moving to the new index in the municipal business, and it's going to depend a little bit on the macro environment, a little bit on the market dynamic.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then on the underlying volume trend, should we see a year-over-year improvement in the second half relative to the first half, as the drivers of this continue to improve? Residential construction, non-residential construction, it turns into more volume in the cans, the whole bit?","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think based, Michael, on where we are right now and what we see in the future, you know we feel comfortable with the volume for the year up about 1.5%.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So to your point on more volume in the cans, we are seeing some pretty good trends in service increases, less decreases. We didn't talk about that in our comments, but that's all continues to trend very well. But again, as you know, we've all thought this thing was going to recover quicker than it did, and so I want to temper you know everyone's excitement. I mean we feel really good about the business, we are very proud of the team, but let's see how things, let's see how the market and the macro issue sort of comes around in Q3.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. Well, nice job in the quarter. Thank you for everything.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks Michael.","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","The next question will come from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys.","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Joe.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Joe.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Don, could you just put some figures, or maybe at least some color, around the reduction in rollbacks and churn that you alluded to earlier?","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we can do that. You want to give him some stats, Brian?","Brian M. DelGhiaccio - Senior VP-Finance & Head-Investor Relations","Joe, if you kind of take a look at each of those components right, so we talk about, call it gross price, what we're going out to the market with to our customers, as well as the impact of rollback, and then obviously that impacted churn. And if you kind of take a look at the sequential improvement in yield from 2.1% to 2.4%, each of those components had a relatively equal contribution. So think of it like 10 basis points each getting better sequentially from each of those three components, that is basically the way that you compute average yield.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, understood. Yeah, interesting that you guys are actually capturing a greater percentage of that, whereas it looks like one of your competitors is capturing less, which might be a mix issue. But maybe switching gears for my follow-up, Don, I get the $0.01 hit from commodity prices sold. I'm just curious how you view that. Is it theoretically possible that \u2013 or is it positive that your third-party MRF vendors are actually doing away with rebates now? Does it suggest that maybe there's some momentum in the industry to pushing back on recycling, and theoretically this business can be structurally improved?","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it's theoretical, yes, right. So I'll tell you what's happened historically, when we've seen down cycles in recycling is just about the time the market starts to sort of revolt and raise prices and maybe constrain some service, the volume \u2013 or the commodity prices bounce back, and then the market doesn't really change very much. So the fact that this has been so steep, and I would say sustained, probably we've had great luck with moving prices forward in the open market, which says frankly, customers are willing to pay almost as much for recycling as waste. And then we've done a lot of customer insight work in our marketing group here, and customers are telling us that, it's important. If it's really important to them, they're willing to pay for it. So customer demand should accompany willingness to pay, and that's our view.","Now in the \u2013 the open market's one thing, because the contractual obligations that we have with customers are different and shorter term. A lot of our recycling is done with municipalities; those are longer-term contracts, as I said in my comments. Those will take longer to turn, but I'll guarantee you this, our team here, our recycling group, our operating group, our sales team, our pricing team, all working very diligently together to think about how we are going to, as I said re-imagine the recycling business here of the future, and our view is that it's not going to be the same way it occurs today, it just can't be.","And so, the overarching point there is, if we want recycling to really truly be sustainable, sustainability can't happen without consistent profitability. It's just impossible. And so we've got to find a new way to make the model truly sustainable, therefore sustainably or consistently profitable. That's again a mouthful, but it's what we're working on. We're still committed to it, because our customers want it, and as I said, if they really demand it then that should be accompanied with willingness to pay.","Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Appreciate it, thank you.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Layne (34:43) with First Analysis. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys thanks for taking my question.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey Ken (34:50).","Unknown Speaker","Let's see, just a little bit more on the pricing side again. It looks this was the second quarter where average yield came in above 2%. I just want to see if you have any view or expectations for the remainder of the year?","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we are not going to give you quarterly expectations, because I've said I think pricing will look more like 2%, the original guidance we gave you was 1.5%. So all these things coming together, again the tools being deployed, you know, the benefit of organic growth, all the things I mentioned earlier, yeah, we think we'll continue to see that kind of pricing for the reminder of the year. You know, we do have a couple of things on the forefront here, the comp gets a little bit tougher in the second half for the year, we have some one time pricing actions that we took in the second half of last year that don't happen again in 2015, but all-in we think pricing will be a pretty good story for us from here out through the end.","Unknown Speaker","Sure, thanks. That's helpful. And then I guess switching gears a little bit, more on the recycling side, are you expecting sort of any improvement in the back half of the year, just given some of the recent stabilization in the commodity pricing environment?","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, the guidance we've given you assumes that recycling stays flat, commodity sales just stay flat from here for the remainder of the year. If it takes a bounce, that will be a little bit of upside for us.","Unknown Speaker","Sure, sure, okay. Great. Well, thanks guys, and good job.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. How are you guys?","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good Alex, how are you today.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good, Don, thanks. On the cost side, so just looking at the details that you provide, so buckets like labor and related benefits, maintenance and repair, SG&A, I think of those as relatively fixed, and so buckets where you should have leverage on when volumes start to really pick up. And just looking at the year-over-year change on those costs, it sounds like they are up almost in that high single-digit range. So just on those buckets, can you just talk about why we are seeing that kind of inflation there? May be zoning in on the repair side, where you have one fleet happening, I mean I would think at some point those costs are to start to level out for you?","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, you know, so Alex, you've got to keep in mind also what I said during my comments, that you've got a 250 basis point reduction in revenue, and that reduction in revenue is driving an increase in those costs, in terms of a percentage of revenue. So if you \u2013 some of the lines items that you called out are some of the larger cost categories. So in terms of labor, that's about 40 basis points of the overall increase. It's about 20 basis points on the maintenance side, and just for reference it's 20 basis points on the SG&A also. So you got to take that into consideration when you're looking at the basis point increase year-over-year.","The other thing that we need to take into consideration is the mix of business year-over-year. As we've mentioned, the volume increases that we got have really been focused in on the industrial business and on the residential business, and there's not as much \u2013 our ability to leverage those costs isn't quite as great as some of the other cost categories.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So remember too, we've got acquisitions year-over-year, we've got volume growth, and as it relates to maintenance specifically, we pointed out a couple of times before, while we're very pleased with our One Fleet initiative, and it's exactly the right thing to do, when we started that program we did not see some of the fleet complexity coming our way. So we do have some cost increases coming from the new cleaner engines and some of that. So \u2013 and I'll just remind everybody, we didn't talk about it here on the call, but one of the paybacks on One Fleet is the \u2013 aging the fleet in a methodical fashion and getting that CapEx savings that we've talked about a number times; one-time $200 million savings, plus the ongoing benefit of running a fleet that's about a year older, which is about $15 million a year in CapEx. So maintenance specifically is \u2013 we're getting a great payback on that.","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","One finer point also I think on the labor side to keep in mind, is that we did call out some integration costs this year, and that's obviously included in the labor numbers.","Brian M. DelGhiaccio - Senior VP-Finance & Head-Investor Relations","Yeah, and Alex just to put some numbers around the acquisition and volume growth that Don was talking about, our acquisition revenue is up 2.7% year-over-year, and volume's up 1.1%. So when you add those types of revenue, it's going to come along with it, costs, and so when you're just looking at cost change expressed as a percentage year-over-year, you've got to include those revenues as well.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, okay, I appreciate everybody's thoughts there. And then in the filing, the 8-K, you do break out an E&P waste services revenue number; I think it's $27 million for the quarter? So is that essentially the Tervita revenue that you're reporting?","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, that's Tervita; that's primarily the Tervita revenue.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys.","Brian M. DelGhiaccio - Senior VP-Finance & Head-Investor Relations","Hello, Al.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hope you're all doing well. I want to focus on core price for a minute, and I joined a little late so I apologize if \u2013 I know you had 3.8% for the quarter; I am not sure what it was in the first quarter. But my question is driven at the open market piece, and in particular if the volume trends are favorable, why we should not expect that number, that contribution of open market pricing, to be better going forward? Or is that the real reason why guidance is being lifted?","Charles F. Serianni - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think what we're saying is that we are lifting guidance because of the favorability that we're seeing right now in our solid waste business. You know, what I called out before is a 60 basis point increase in margin year-over-year due to the solid waste business. Keep in mind also that if you kind of look at our increasing guidance overall, a good portion of that increase is really due to the solid waste business, and \u2013 which is primarily yield.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and it's being offset by a couple of things; we called out the commodities. We called out some of the headwind from E&P. But you are right, the core business is operating very well, and as we turn around these two very small parts of our business, although obviously volatile parts of our business, that will all come in behind it, so...","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great.","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're on the right track. The business is doing very well, Al.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","No, I hear you. And I guess the question that \u2013 the follow-on to that would be at some point we'll start to see that in terms of the EBITDA margin. I know there's number of moving parts and we need that restricted portion to get north to 2% to give you some help?","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, another way of saying it, right, is if recycling hadn't cratered on us, and E&P hadn't dried up, right, our margins would have been up 60 basis points. So that's it.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Just a follow up I guess; one of your competitors articulated, probably for the first time, their affection for another price index as well, and I know you've talked about it's a slow process, but can you give any more insights in terms of how that's going? I know it's a process, but in terms of the realization of the new index on the customers?","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right, so we've said that approximately, what, $2.4 billion of our business is that, again, that 30%, right. So it is restricted to some type of index. What we've been talking about lately is about $800 million of that piece is the smaller municipal contract, generally residential only, call it a five-year contract.","So that $800 million, that's the first piece we've been working on to move to a new index. We've now moved $150 million of that business, $150 million of the $800 million, to a new index, that's confirmed. Still working on the balance. And as you would expect, logically, when we try to change how this occurs with our customers and within the market, we will start with smaller contracts, and having good success. The remaining $1.7 billion is larger contracts and franchise agreements that tend to run a lot longer than five years, and also include oftentimes commercial, small container, large container business. So, we're up to $150 million out of the targeted $800 million. We're progressing every quarter. We don't know how far it will go, we're certainly making strong arguments and frankly successful arguments for it, and we'll continue to do it.","Again, the overarching issue here is, in these kind of public-private partnerships they've got to be mutually beneficial; it's unrealistic for our municipal partners to expect us to settle for an index that doesn't adequately cover our inflation. So we've got to cover our inflation net of productivity on a consistent basis. That's reasonable, it's fair, and that's one of the reasons we're getting it done. The fact that there is this water-sewer-trash index, something we can point to that's been in use now for what 15 years or whatever, is helping. And so, it's too early to tell how long it's going to take and how far it's going to go. I can tell this, we're not going to stop pushing. And that's \u2013 we'll update you every quarter as we go through time, but that's certainly helping and will certainly show some benefit into next year.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Just in terms of the customer feedback, maybe you don't want to share, but I guess if it's helpful for them on their side of the equation, there would seem to be reasons that the acceptance rate would be high going forward?","Donald W. Slager - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so it's fair, it's equitable and in some cases it's helpful for them, especially those municipalities that have their own sewer and water infrastructure that has been struggling to keep up with the pace of inflation. Frankly, we weren't the only ones that didn't know that this sewer, water \u2013 water-sewer-trash index existed, so we're shedding a lot of light on that. And so again, progress continues and we're hopeful and confident that we'll have another positive update for you as we go through the year.","Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","That will conclude the question and answer session.

When events are scheduled, the dates, times and presentations are posted on our website.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Don.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased with our strong third quarter results. The team sustained the momentum built in the first half of the year by capitalizing on strong solid waste trends to drive both price and underlying volume growth, advancing our multi-year initiatives to provide an improved customer experience, in addition to safer and more efficient operations, and executing our plans to mitigate recycling headwinds in the short-term and advance our long-term strategy to transform our recycling business.","As a result, in the third quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow per share, despite an $0.08 headwind from recycling, invested an additional $53 million in value-enhancing acquisitions, bringing our year-to-date total investment to $133 million, and returned approximately $200 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","During the quarter, we continued to see solid revenue and EBITDA growth in our collection and disposal businesses, as well as energy services. Together, they contributed 80 basis points of margin expansion. The pricing environment continued to be favorable in the third quarter. Core price was 3.9% and increased 30 basis points from the second quarter.","In the open market, core price increased 20 basis points sequentially to 4.6%. In the restricted market, core price increased 50 basis points sequentially to 2.8%. This is the highest restricted core price we've achieved in nearly 10 years.","Improving the customer experience continues to be a critical part of our overall business strategy. We achieve this by developing and offering products that are designed to meet our customers' wants and needs and delivering superior service. Doing so helps us retain our customers for a longer period of time and earn a price increase each year.","In turn, we successfully raised prices while maintaining our customer defection rate below 7% for a third consecutive quarter.","Additionally, we continue to convert our CPI-based contracts to an alternative pricing mechanism. We now have 25% of our CPI-based contracts representing $625 million, transitioned to a waste-related index or fixed rate increase of 3% or greater for the annual price adjustment. These waste indices are more closely aligned with our cost structure and continue to run higher than CPI.","We also continued to see strong underlying volume growth in our collection and disposal businesses in the third quarter. Excluding the impact of non-regrettable losses and a difficult special waste comp, total volume increased 1% over the prior year. We believe the current economic backdrop, including solid consumer sentiment readings, supports continued top-line growth.","Next, our energy service business continues to perform well. In the third quarter, total energy services revenues increased 30% over the prior year. Our recycling business also improved in the third quarter. We successfully increased prices and reduced our operating cost by 3.5% sequentially.","As we expected, current market conditions are serving as a catalyst to transform our recycling business into a more durable, economically sustainable business, one where companies can continue to invest for the benefit of their communities without undue risk.","Our team has been working diligently to execute our short-term plans to mitigate recycling headwinds, as well as advance our longer-term plans to transform our recycling business.","In the open market, we continue to see new recycling service at 90% to 100% of the price of solid waste, demonstrating our customers' willingness to pay. We rolled out a recycling processing fee to our recycling collection customers to cover higher processing costs. And this fee contributed 25 basis points to total revenue growth.","In the restricted market, we successfully negotiated price increases with a portion of our municipal processing customers, with an annualized benefit of $6 million. These will go into effect in the fourth quarter.","We also continued to secure immediate price increases from many of our municipal collection customers. These price increases contributed approximately 10 basis points to average yield. Additionally, we transitioned some of our municipal collection customers to a new pricing model, including multiple municipalities in Texas, Illinois and Iowa.","Finally, we continued to leverage technology to increase productivity, reduce costs and improve the quality of material recovered at our processing centers. As a result, we sequentially improved our year-over-year cost headwinds by $0.01.","I'm extremely pleased with the results our team has been able to deliver thus far. Although it will take time, with help from our customers and consumers, we can ensure recycling is sustainable for generations to come.","Turning to our full-year 2018 guidance. On the second quarter earnings call, we advised that we expected to be at the lower end of our EPS and free cash flow guidance ranges. Given the strength of the business, we now expect EPS to be near the midpoint of the guidance range and free cash flow to be near the upper end of the guidance range, despite a recycling headwind of approximately $0.30 versus the prior year.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Chuck to discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail. Chuck?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Don. Third quarter revenue was approximately $2.6 billion, an increase of $102 million or 4.1% over the prior year. The increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.2% and acquisitions of 1.9%.","The components of internal growth are as follows. First, average yield increased 2.4% and was in line with our expectations. Average yield in the collection business was 2.8%, which includes 3% in the small container business, 3% in the large container business and 2.3% in the residential business.","Average yield in the post collection business was 1.7%, which includes landfill MSW of 2.2%. The majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing pricing restrictions.","Total core price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.9% and increased 30 basis points from the second quarter. Core price in the open market was 4.6% and core price in the restricted portion of our business was 2.8%.","The second component of internal growth is total volume, which decreased 10 basis points over the prior year. Volume in our large container business increased 60 basis points and volume in the small container business decreased 30 basis points.","Small container volume included a 90-basis-point impact from intentionally shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volume would have increased 60 basis points.","Volume in our residential business decreased 2.9%. The decrease was expected based upon our strategic decision not to renew certain contracts that fell below our return criteria. The post collection business made up of third-party landfill and transportation volume increased 2.4%. Landfill volume increased 2.3%.","Growth in MSW and special waste volume was partially offset by an anticipated decrease in C&D volume. More specifically, landfill MSW volume increased 3%. Landfill special waste volume increased 3.9%, despite a difficult comp in the prior year. C&D volume decreased 60 basis points versus the prior year due to a difficult comp. In the prior year, C&D volume increased substantially due to hurricane-related clean-up efforts in the South.","The third component of internal growth is fuel recovery fees, which increased 80 basis points. The increase relates to a rise in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel increased to $3.24 in the third quarter from $2.63 in the prior year, an increase of 23%. The current average diesel price is up $0.14 from September levels.","The next component, energy services revenue, increased 10 basis points. This is primarily due to an increase in drilling activity in the Permian Basin where we continue to be well-positioned.","The final component of internal growth is recycling, processing and commodity revenue, which decreased 1%. The decrease in revenue primarily relates to a decrease in the number of tons sold and lower recycle commodity prices, which was partially offset by the new recycling processing fee rolled out to our recycling collection customers to cover higher processing costs.","The recycling processing fee contributed an incremental 25 basis points of pricing. It's important to note that our average yield of 2.4% does not include the 25-basis-point benefit from the recycling processing fee.","Excluding glass\/organics, average commodity prices decreased 37% to $106 per ton in the third quarter, down from $167 per ton in the prior year. In the fourth quarter, we expect the headwind from lower recycle commodity prices to decrease as the prior-year comp becomes easier.","Next I will discuss changes in margin. In the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 70 basis points to 28.4% from 29.1% in the prior year. This included 80 basis points of expansion from the solid waste business, including collection, disposal and energy services, which was more than offset by a 150-basis-point headwind from recycling.","Keep in mind, following 28 quarters of low CPI, we are now just beginning to see the margin benefit from higher CPI in conversions to the water, sewer, trash index.","In the third quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 10.2%. For the full year, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 10.4%.","Third quarter 2018 interest expense was $95 million, which included $10 million of non-cash amortization. Keep in mind, 17% of our debt portfolio has a variable interest rate. Therefore every 100-basis-point increase in variable rates will increase annual interest expense by approximately $15 million.","Our all-in adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 23.6% and in line with our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we expect our all-in effective tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.82, an increase of $0.15 or 22% over the prior year. EPS included a $0.12 benefit from tax reform, which was partially offset by an $0.08 headwind from recycling.","Adjusted free cash flow through the first three quarters was $968 million, an increase of 60% versus the prior year. The growth in free cash flow was due to an increase in EBITDA, lower cash taxes primarily due to tax reform, and the timing of tax payments. During the quarter, we returned $203 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Don to discuss our preliminary outlook for 2019.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you, Chuck. Given the predictability and consistency of our business, similar to prior years, we are providing a preliminary outlook for next year. We are currently midway through our annual planning process. Based on our initial reviews and assuming current business and economic conditions continue, we project the following for 2019: Adjusted EPS of $3.23 to $3.28 and adjusted free cash flow of $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion. This represents mid- to high-single-digit growth in EPS and free cash flow per share despite rising interest rate environment.","Also contemplated in our outlook is a tax rate headwind of approximately $0.16 and an incremental $50 million capital investment of tax reform savings back into the business for the benefit of our front-line employees. Excluding the impact of taxes and tax reinvestment, our outlook includes double-digit growth in both earnings and free cash flow per share.","We will achieve these results in 2019 by securing price increases in excess of our cost inflation, growing volume for the seventh straight year, executing on our profitable growth through differentiation strategy to enhance the customer experience and drive additional operating leverage in the business; continuing to transition our municipal recycling customers to a more durable fee-based pricing model, including a fee that fully acknowledges the cost to collect and process the material with a more equitable risk sharing arrangement; effectively deploying capital to fund profitable organic growth and value-enhancing acquisitions; and consistently and efficiently returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Similar to prior years, we will provide detailed financial guidance for 2019 in February of next year.","In summary, our 2018 performance, along with a favorable economic backdrop, position us well for continued growth in 2019. Next year, as we anniversary the headwinds from recycling, we expect our results to demonstrate the strength and operating leverage of our business. This includes strong top-line growth, 30 basis points to 50 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion, and double-digit growth in EPS and free cash flow per share.","At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Slager. The first question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Tyler.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Tyler.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Yeah, nice quarter. So I appreciate the early look into 2019. You mentioned the 30 basis points to 50 basis points of margin expansion next year. That's very solid. But I am a little curious about how we get there. So, first, is there any assumption of a margin benefit from, say, recycling, be it a processing fee or commodities?","And then, given what's going on the unit cost inflation side of the equation, what kind of average yield do you think you need to achieve to overcome that heightened inflation? I mean, do you need north of a 3% yield to get there?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","What an ironic question that was, Tyler. So, look, let me start with a really strong performance here as we end the year, right? So we're really happy with the quarter. Again, the underlying fundamentals of the business of strong volume\/price, and we pulled through some of the highest prices we've seen in years, right? So, that price is going to continue and build and we'll have certain things that start to anniversary in our favour.","We're already having impact from our efforts to change the recycling model here in this year and we'll have more impact in Q4. Those will start to come to bear throughout the year. And again, we have 1,100 contracts we talk to, municipal contracts. We've already converted quite a few of them to a new model. We are still talking to over 40% of them today is to move in that direction. So there's a lot of that good happening.","As far as the commodity value, we have that flat into next year, right? So, if that comes back, we sort of get the automatic benefit. You've heard me say before, I hope it doesn't come back. I hope it just stays right where it is, because that's how we'll fix this recycling model.","And we don't want any of our people sort of getting weak in the knees. We need to push through to a new model that gives us predictable consistent returns in that business and then shares the upside with customers, if they do a good job and a responsible job with the contamination. So we're going to continue to push that.","We're getting benefit in maintenance. We're getting benefit in some of the labor activity. We've got a lot of good things happening underlying the business that are starting to now show up, and that's how we get the margin expansion. It's just good old-fashioned blocking, tackling. Pricing continued to be strong, and a good economic backdrop in solid waste.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe coming back a little bit to the pricing. So I know next year the CPI look-back is going to benefit 2019 mathematically. But I'm just curious if you can talk about how quickly you can push through on the open market side, maybe talk about how Capture plays a role in that? And maybe how quickly you can pivot in the open market side?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","As it relates to recycling or just solid waste?","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Just solid waste pricing","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, again, Capture is the tool we use to really, one, make our sales team more efficient, make the selling experience better for customers, but also keep some level of centralized control over the process. So Capture is a real-time tool.","So as we see the opportunity and the pricing flexibility, markets change, we're able to really act quickly with the pricing that we move into the marketplace. And of course, when we price our open market customers, we use this RPM process, where we're only pricing a segment of the customers per month. So we've got the ability to kind of accelerate\/decelerate depending on what we're seeing in the market.","So that's the tool we use. And again, if you look at the pricing that we're getting now, I think it was on the last call you asked me some similar question. Don, are you going to need pricing that looks more like 3% to start to offset some of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing in, for instance, long-haul trucking or leachate? And my answer to you was, yes, we're going to have to move pricing north from where it is today.","And you can see now just in the last few months, our efforts, moving pricing in the right direction sequentially. So we're going to continue, as I said in my comments, to get pricing over normal inflation costs, net of productivity. And we're prepared to do that. Our people are good at it. We've got the systems in place to do it. And we're confident we can do that with the good economic backdrop we have.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Good. I'll turn it over. Good stuff. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon. My first question is just around how you guys think about your U.S. housing exposure versus others in the sector. It feels like legacy Republic had more exposure because of Sunbelt states. But then you also have a slide in your deck that others do not, signifying sort of a correlation to single-family housing starts. So do you guys have more exposure? Or is that just a coincidence that you guys talk about it more?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, I'll let Chuck give you some numbers on this. But I think we had a lot of exposure when the bubble burst, because of the overcapacity that was built out in places like Florida and Arizona and Las Vegas. And those are markets that we're very dense in. Of course, we don't have that problem today. Frankly, today there's more sort of a supply shortage.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Right? So we're on the other end of it. So I still think this steady growth in housing is still good for the business. I'd much prefer sort of a steady improvement than a sudden improvement.","And if the market continues to move toward the all-time average of 1.5 million [housing starts], even the 1.4 million, we're sub that today. So I think we're well positioned and right in the way of the growth. And so the growth will come to us. As far as having more than anybody else, I don't know that that's true.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think that that's true either. When we talk about housing starts, we're really talking about that as a proxy for consumer sentiment, how the consumers really feel about the economy. The consumers are really the ones that drive GDP. They're really the ones that drive the growth in the business.","So we look at housing right now, it's still strong, it's 1.2 million units and that's up 6.6% over the prior year. So we still see good growth in housing. Even if it stays kind of at 1.2 million or creeps up a little bit from there, that still tells us that the consumer feels very good about the economy. And if they feel good about the economy, they're going to spend more money and that's going to generate waste, which is good for us.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","And remember, Hamzah, we lag these changes, right? So if there's something moving there that is of any sort of material impact to the business, I think we'll see it coming a long way off.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Right. Makes sense. And my follow-up question is just around how to think about M&A as you look into 2019. You talked about $200 million this year. It feels like the last time you did below $100 million was in 2016. So, just maybe walk us through, is $200 million the right number to look at in 2019? And is that just solid waste or are you looking at energy as well? Thank you.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, thanks. Well, look, I think overall I would tell you that the pipeline is robust. We're not giving exact guidance on M&A for next year, but I think you could say it's certainly going to be north of $150 million in 2019 based on what we know today. That that pipeline builds over time. So we've got a good group of people that wake up every day and think about this. We've got a number of interesting acquisition candidates in the pipeline today. So we'll see good progress continue. And again, the good news is we're still paying a reasonable amount for these deals on a multiple basis post synergy. So I think we'll see a continued benefit from acquisitions still and well into 2019.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Brian.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Brian.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for the yearly color on 2019 guidance. Just to try and tease out a little bit some of the components, I know it's still early, but the 30 basis points to 50 basis points of margin expansion, I just wanted to make sure I have the right starting point. I think you were previously talking about a 28.0% for 2018. Is that still what you're looking for? And so we should think about it being like a 28.3%, a 28.5% next year, is that right?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","That's right, Brian.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","You're right.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","That's right.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. So, just want to make sure I have the right starting point there. Yeah. And then based on your comments around the tax impact next year and assuming even if acquisitions contribute only half the growth that they did this year, it seems to imply yield price plus volumes are maybe up 3%. My math might be off a little bit, but seems like somewhere in that ballpark.","It seems still lower than what others are talking about. We have one guy talking about 3% plus 3% this morning. Others are doing more like 2% plus 2% in this environment. Just wondering if you think about 2019, we're talking about price maybe having to get almost up to 3% just to offset inflation. Does that leave us much for volume growth? And if not, is there anything you guys are looking at in the 2019 that would cause you to think we're not going to see a pickup in volume growth?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, all right. Well, look, we're not giving a detailed guidance for 2019. We've given our preliminary outlook. Again, based on what we're seeing in the business today, again, strong economic backdrop, we still think there's room to run here, good execution in our initiatives, already good progress in restructuring and revamping this recycling business, really strong pricing, strongest in years.","As Chuck said, we're starting now see the benefit of the compounding benefit of rolling over with the new alternative index starting to take place. Higher CPI, we think that continues to fuel progress into 2019. Remember, when it comes to volume, we've got a little bit of our business to shed still with the brokered business. We're not afraid to walk away from bad contracts with municipalities. So we talked about non-regrettable losses, so that'll still be part of our 2019 story, right?","But, again, we're starting from a strong position here in ending Q3 and already in Q4. So I gave you a lot of color, but we think the volume and the pricing traction that we're seeing will continue into 2019.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Yeah. I think that broker component continuing is probably what I was missing initially, but that makes sense. Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. And I would just add, we're talking about the 28% margin here in 2018. If not for this recycling headwind, we'd be at 29.5% for 2018, okay? So we would have been sort of a stone's throw from that 30% goal we set for ourselves. And then our friends in China can then kind of put us back on our heels a little bit. But we're standing up and we're going right back at it again and all these things we've got, they're making progress for us in 2018, they're going to bode well for us in 2019. We're going to march right back to a better margin.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon. Appreciate you calling out the 25 bps revenue growth from recycling processing fees. You're clearly making a lot of progress there. So, first, can you remind us of the magnitude of the EBITDA impact you're expecting from recycling this fiscal year and what kind of tailwind you might be able to generate in the recycling line of business in 2019 as a result of these initiatives?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So what we're expecting this year is 140 basis points of compression from recycling in 2018. And obviously, we'll get a little bit of a benefit associated with the actions that we've already put into place in Q3.","So, if we just talk about the annual value of the Q3 actions, it's about $40 million, that's the annual value. So, about $20 million of a rollover benefit in 2019. And I need to point out that that doesn't include any of the actions that we expect to be able to take here in Q4.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Next, I think you mentioned a $0.16 tax rate headwind for next year. Does that imply the tax rate going back to 27% or 28%, what's the right number?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, going back to 27%.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then if I could just take one more crack at what I think a couple others have been trying to get at. It looks like you'll probably get 1%, maybe 1.5% growth from M&A next year. You're moving past the impacts of rev rec.","So, underlying volume growth in particular, I think a lot of people are focused on that. You're coming off of kind of an easy headline comp this year. So, any reason why underlying volume growth rate, you can't be in that 1% to 2% range?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, again, this is not guidance, right? But let's just talk about the predictability of the business, that's the hallmark of the business, right? Other than sort of these sort of anomalies like China's actions or things like that, or the housing bubble reaching 3 million units or whatever heck it did and bursting years ago, generally speaking, things do not always move pretty slow.","So, when you've got good traction and momentum, you've got the underlying fundamentals we have, they tend to sort of stay with you for a period of time. And as I said, I think it was to Hamzah, because we lag, we still sort of see these other big changes coming. So, think about that predictability. We also tell people, right, that the business grows with household formation, population growth, business formation. We see that continuing, right?","We also tell people that, look, on average the business can grow sort of through this cycle sort of 1.5% to 2% organic volume, right? Now we have some takeaways from that because we've got some business we're shedding in a non-regrettable way. So I didn't just give you guidance. I just gave you general backdrop of this business. Pricing, we generally are able to price ahead of inflation. Now we ran into a problem when CPI went away from us and now we're getting our grip back on that.","So, as I said in my comments, we're going to price ahead of inflation in 2019. So, that pricing historically has been 2.5% to, in some cases, 3%. Now that sort of varies a little bit by line of business, by market vertical. But those are sort of generalities that underscore the strength, the predictability in this business, and that's what we're seeing now.","We're seeing some of that CPI anomaly sort of going, again, in our rear-view mirror. We're making a great deal of headway in this China situation. And while it's just a lot of hard work, it's all stuff we know how to do and we're already getting the benefit. It's showing up in the numbers now and that's what gives you confidence into 2019.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much for the color, Don. I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you so much. I know there's been some discussion in the industry, and I know we heard from one of your competitors this morning about some increasing third-party costs, transportation-related, labor-related. Can you address that? I'm assuming that's something you're seeing. How you're able to push that through in terms of price increases to your customers?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. We are seeing some of that. Again, we generally don't handle our own waste transfer trucking. So we generally hire a third-party to move waste from our transfer stations to our landfills. The long-haul trucking companies are experiencing a great deal of cost increase and labor shortage and turnover. That's kind of coming into that space a little bit.","We're doing a much better job with our own drivers, with our own front-line workforce, because we've spent a lot of time trying to work on creating a great work environment, employee engagement and the rest of it.","But we are seeing that coming and we're building that into our cost inflation model. We're building that into our pricing assumptions. We're building that into our go-forward planning when it comes to renewing large contracts and so forth.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. And my follow-up question, I just want to confirm something I thought I heard you say. But if we take out the recycling headwinds that you've seen this year and just look at your core business, margins are up on a year-over-year basis. I know there's some noise in terms of the revenue recognition, but I just want to confirm that that's the case.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Margins would be up anywhere from 60 basis points to 80 basis points during the year. And obviously, that's being masked this year because of recycling. But when we guide to 30 basis points to 50 basis points EBITDA margin expansion, that's where you truly see how the solid waste piece of the business is growing.","Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Fantastic. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask a quick question on you had a nice jump in the restricted pricing, up 50 bps. When we kind of think about the open, I mean you're kind of at this 4.5% mark the last three quarters. Should we be thinking next year that's kind of the ceiling on the pricing gains in the open market? And where you're getting most of the leverage is really on that restricted because of the CPI? Is that kind of how to think about it? Is there like a limit on the pricing gains base that we're seeing in the open market right now?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. You could think about it that way. I mean, we're going to continue to explore price elasticity by market, by market vertical, whether it's large container, small container, what have you. We're going to continue to do that. Our tools allow us to do that, our people are really good at it.","We are, again, seeing the benefit now of the rolling over of moving restricted business to a more credible and appropriate index. That's certainly going to give us a lot of help as we go through time. And even though CPI is starting to look a little more like normal, we're not going to relax and go back to CPI.","We are moving forward to change contracts over time to water, sewer, trash or a fixed 3% or greater. That's still our model. That's still what we're aiming at. Just like I said, if China changes its tune, if recycling gets better, we're still going to continue to change the model to something that's durable. We're going to take this volatility out of the business.","So again, I'm not giving detailed pricing guidance by market vertical today. But again, the underlying strength, the results we're getting today, you can kind of model those into next year and get a pretty good handle on it I think.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Makes sense. And then on the internal cost inflation, we're kind of thinking about next year. I mean, I know the rule of thumb I believe used to be around 2.5% and then you guys would get 50 bps of productivity. I mean, how is that framework kind of changing into next year? And can you still get that 50 bps of productivity gains?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So what we've said historically is cost inflation at about 2% to 2.25% and that's net of the productivity gains that you spoke of.","As we look now and then into 2019, we're thinking that costs are probably going to trend up closer to 2.5%. And once again, that's net of the productivity gains. And that's why getting the price increase that Don had talked about is so important. And that's what allows us to get the EBITDA margin expansion in 2019.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Right. We've always said, we can't offset normal inflation through productivity. There's just not that much sloppiness in our business. So while we get better every year across many different functions and capabilities, there's not so much sloppiness to overcome inflation. So we just have to adjust pricing to do that.","And when there are real broad-based legitimate things happening in labor or with trucking and those kind of things, we're able to go to customers and get it done. And our contracts, the markets allow us typically to do that.","And again, with CPI now being something that we're getting in our hand or at least when it's improving and we're changing the index, that can help us get that.","Michael Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. One housekeeping, what's the share count you're using for the per share guidance?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","For 2018, Michael, or for 2019?","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","2019.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","For 2019, we're going to have to get back to you on that, Michael, I don't have it in front of me.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, you really helped bring a little clarity to all of this hand-wringing around what the price environment is supposed to be next year. You're at 2.4%, 2.5% second half of this year. You're going to put pricing initiatives in the fourth quarter on an open market basis. CPI is trending at up 40 basis points this year. So it would be reasonable to think that I take the trend out of the second half of this year and it progressively gets better all year long and that's the way to think about it, right?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","In 2019.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. The trend for 2019, yeah, that's right, Michael.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Okay. And then...","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. But we're never just sitting still, right? So there's always something happening in the market with our tools, with the way we're adjusting pricing, with our fees, with whatever, there's always something new happening that ultimately rolls into the pricing format, right? And the reality is that some of these inflationary costs are beyond our control that we have to overcome.","And then as you said, CPI, and every time we're successful in getting a new contract rolled over with a new index, every time we're successful convincing a new recycling customer to go to a fee-based structure, each one of those things just keeps rolling into the business, right, and ultimately moving that number up through time.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then the volume question, everybody keeps wringing our hands about as well. When you shook away all the noise of regrettable losses and contracts you chose to walk away from, this year you had a positive volume that I would assume that's something in that 1.5%, 2-ish range.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, above 1%.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","It was underlying...","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Above 1%.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Above 1%.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","And better next year.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right. So, that's where I was going. Okay. That's all I needed. Thanks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you, Michael.","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","Hey, Michael. Just on your share question, what I would tell you is think about it in how we've always talked about it. We first invest in CapEx and M&A. And then from there, we return the remainder of the cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. So I would just kind of think through that as you're modeling it and we'll get more detailed guidance in February.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Well, you tend to buy back 2% to 3%. So I was assuming I was going to just reduce the number on a rolling basis 2%.","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's a good...","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah, that's fair. That's fair.","Nicole Giandinoto - Republic Services, Inc.","...starting point.","Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Operator","The next question will be from Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Please go ahead.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Hey. Good afternoon. I think, Don, you've been pretty articulate about how you're thinking about pricing. But maybe just a little bit on landfill pricing, and I know a lot of that is locked up under long-term contracts, but just given \u2013 well, it sounds like a good environment overall. Do you expect any sort of inflecting on that in 2019 or thinking about that any differently?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, I should like to expect more landfill pricing, but here's the deal. Most of our landfill volume, besides all the volume that Republic brings to its own landfills, comes from municipalities. So, that restricted price is getting restricted generally to CPI, except for those contracts that we've begun to move to a different index.","The unrestricted volume looks more like a 3% to 4% price increase. So we're going to continue to move that up. I'm a little disappointed that it hasn't been able to move up faster. But as we've shared with you before, I mean we've been pretty straightforward on the cost of these landfills, the cost of leachate, the scarcity of the asset. And we continue to move pricing up and unfortunately that dislocated some volume to other landfills that have been willing to take on all that cost and liability for less than we are. So it's still something that I think over time has more room for upside. That's really not baked into our 2019 guide or 2019 preliminary outlook.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Got it. And my follow-up is I think hopefully pretty easy question which is just can you remind me the consolidation of the service centers, is that totally a 2018 cost benefit or is there some benefit in 2019? And just can you quantify what it is in 2018, if there isn't anything in 2019?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","No we pretty much got it done, right? It's pretty much behind us.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. It's 2018.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","So, just in terms of roughly what the benefit is in 2018 versus 2017?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. It's the SG&A improvement, that's the primary improvement year-over-year, so call it 20 basis points to 30 basis points.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for your closing remarks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, thank you, Denise. In closing, I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment and dedication to operational excellence in creating the Republic Way. And you could all do me one favor and go to recyclingsimplified.com, so everyone can learn how to recycle responsibly. Tell all your friends to be friendly to the planet, it'll change your life.

[Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Lang. Good afternoon, Mr. Lang.","Edward A. Lang","Thank you, Victor. Welcome, good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. This is Ed Lang, and I would like to welcome everyone to Republic Services' Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Don Slager, our CEO; and Tod Holmes, our CFO, are joining me as we discuss our second quarter performance.","Before we get started, I would like to take a moment to remind everyone that some of the information that we discuss on today's call contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties and may be materially different from actual results. Our SEC filings discuss factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations.","Additionally, the material that we discuss today is time-sensitive.

Please note that this call is the property of Republic Services, Inc.

Slager","Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we discuss Republic Services' second quarter performance.","I will now review our second quarter financial performance before discussing our updated 2012 guidance.","Revenue, approximately $2.1 billion. Core price growth in the quarter was 0.6%, which was in line with our expectations. MSW landfill price was 2.4%. Volumes decreased by 1.3%, a majority of the volume decline can be attributed to a loss of Oakleaf and the large national account, both of which we discussed in April.","Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.59. Approximately $0.09 of our earnings resulted from a favorable tax rate. All material tax disputes have now been resolved. Our adjusted free cash flow was $156 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.3%, and SG&A was 9.6%. We repurchased 5.3 million shares in the second quarter for $141 million. We have approximately $480 million remaining under our authorization through 2013.","We remain committed to an efficient cash utilization strategy, which includes increasing cash returns to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Total cash returned to the shareholders was $223 million during the second quarter. Our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.235 per share which is a 7% increase.","Some of our achievements during the second quarter include: Our safety performance continues to improve with a 3.5% favorable reduction in our frequency rate. We have closed on $73 million of acquisitions through June 30, that represents $47 million of annual run rate revenue. We remain on track to complete $100 million of acquisitions for the full year which was the high end of our guidance range.  Our pipeline remains strong for future growth acquisition.","We continue to invest in fleet automation and converting the fleet to CNG. As of June 30, 61% of our residential routes are now automated, and we have placed 223 CNG vehicles into service. In April, we opened a single stream processing facility in Jacksonville, Florida, that increased our capacity in that market by 90,000 tons per year.","Our largest single stream recycling facility, which services the San Jose market, went into operation in July. This startup coincides with converting the city of San Jose commercial and industrial collection service offerings from open market to franchise. In May, we completed a debt refinancing and renewed our 5-year bank facility at lower rates, which, together reduce our annual interest expense by approximately $25 million. Republic does not have a material debt maturity until 2016.","Tod and Ed will now update our financial performance.","Tod C. Holmes","Thanks, Don. As Don indicated, second quarter revenue of approximately $2.1 billion reflects the following components of internal growth: First, core price growth of 0.6%. This level of core price was consistent with our Q1 performance and is also in line with our expectations. Core price is positive in both the collection and disposal businesses, [Audio Gap] higher prices in the disposal business due to landfill MSW price increases of 2.4%. We expect price levels to be comparable between the first and second quarters, which was the case, and we expect prices to modestly rise in the second half of the year as the impact from higher CPI-based pricing takes hold on our restricted customer base.","Our fuel recovery fee decreased by 0.1%. The decrease in fuel recovery fees relates to a decrease in fuel cost. The average price per gallon of diesel declined to $3.95 in Q2 2012 from $4.01 in the prior year, a decrease of 1.5%. Commodity revenue decreased 1%. Commodity prices decreased by 16% to an average price of $122 a ton in Q2 from $146 per ton in the prior year, due to recycling facility commodity volume of 540,000 tons was up 2.1% from the prior year and up 1.8% on a same-store basis. Our current commodity prices are approximately $112 per ton, which is down from the guidance we provided in April of $129 per ton. For reference purposes, a $10 per ton change in commodity values equals approximately $0.03 of full year EPS, which includes the impact of our recycling facility and collection businesses.","Turning to volume. Q2 volumes decreased by 130 basis points year-over-year. Most of the decline relates to a few specific losses including the Oakleaf business and a large national account. Our collection business volumes were down 0.3%. Excluding the losses I just mentioned, our total collection volume was actually positive.","Disposal volumes were down 4.7% versus the prior year, which relates primarily to MSW tons at our transfer stations and landfills. Again, this relates primarily to a lost municipal contracts in prior quarters and also the competitive pressures in our L.A. market, which we discussed back in April.","In Q2, special waste volumes were essentially flat with the prior year, and we did not see the typical seasonal increase in landfill C&D volumes.","Now, I will discuss the second quarter year-over-year margin. Q2 2012 adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.3% compared to 31.1% in the prior year. This is an 80-basis point decrease. Some of the more significant changes in margins include: First, labor. A 60 basis point increase in expense is mostly due to normal increases in wages and health care cost, and also a change in our revenue mix. Disposal volumes, commodity revenues and subcontract revenues are down which have little or no variable labor cost. Additionally, there is an increase of about 10 basis points related to work stoppages that occurred during the first quarter. Improvements in collection labor productivity partially offset the increase in labor cost, primarily in the residential business, through automation.  Second, disposal. The improvement of 30 basis points relates to decreased disposal expense primarily due to an increase in internalization. Third, our maintenance cost. The 70 basis point increase in maintenance expense relates to implementation costs associated with our One Fleet maintenance initiative, an increase in the cost of tires across our supplier base and also the refurbishing of containers versus purchasing new containers which, from a cash standpoint, is an efficient operating practice.","Next, fuel. The 20 basis point improvement is due to a 1.5% decrease in the cost of diesel. After considering the impact of related fuel recovery fees, the net margin improvement was 10 basis points. The current cost of diesel is approximately $3.78 per gallon, which is down from guidance we provided in April of $4.13 per gallon. For reference purposes, a $0.10 change in diesel fuel per gallon is about $0.01 of full year EPS, which includes the impact of fuel recovery fees.","Finally, cost of goods sold. The 30 basis point improvement relates to a reduction in rebates paid for volumes delivered to our recycling facilities. Cost of goods sold decreased to an average of $39 per ton from $48 per ton in the prior year. While the change in cost was favorable, when you consider the decrease in related commodity revenues, there was a 40 basis point decline in EBITDA margin.","Our second quarter 2002 SG&A of 9.6% was consistent with the prior year. We expect our full year SG&A expense to be consistent with our previous guidance at slightly above 10% of revenue. DD&A, as a percentage of revenue, was 11.4% in the current quarter -- current year versus 10.9% in the prior year. The 50 basis point increase in expense primarily relates to a landfill liability adjustments recorded in the current quarter for sites that have already closed. Additionally, the prior year included the favorable impact of expansions granted, which should not repeat in the current quarter.  DD&A is higher than capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue due to the amortization of intangibles.","Ed will now discuss interest expense, taxes and our free cash flow.","Edward A. Lang","Thanks, Tod. Second quarter 2012 interest expense was $99 million, which included $15 million of noncash amortization. As Don mentioned, we called $750 million of senior notes due in 2017 and issued new debt for 10 years at a rate of 3.55%. This lower rate will reduce annual cash interest expense by approximately $23 million. We also renewed our 5-year bank facility at lower pricing that will generate over $2 million in annual savings.","Our EPS guidance included the favorable impact of refinancing this debt, but excluded any premiums paid or debt discounts written off in connection with early extinguishments. Our annual run rate interest expense, after the refinancing, is approximately $385 million, of which $55 million is noncash. Our refinancing activity since December 2008, which have benefited from our investment grade status in low rate environment, have reduced annual interest expense by approximately $230 million. We have now completed all significant refinancing transactions.","I will now discuss taxes. Our second quarter 2012 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by finalizing Allied's 2002 exchange of partnership interest matter, and favorably resolving other tax matters including closing out open federal tax years through 2008. In April, we guided to a 37% full year 2012 effective tax rate. This included the benefit from finalizing the exchange of partnership interest matter since we were in the late stages of negotiations with the IRS. We did not include the other tax matters, which resulted in about $0.03 of additional EPS. We now expect a full year 2012 tax rate of approximately 36%. We expect the second half of 2012 effective tax rate to be approximately 40%.","To summarize the tax impact, we saw a $0.09 benefit in the second quarter relative to the 37% full year tax rate we provided in April. We expect $0.06 of this benefit to flip in the second half of the year since we are expecting a second half tax rate of approximately 40%. The net impact versus the April guidance is a positive $0.03, which is the amount by which we raise the top end of our EPS guidance range.","I will now discuss free cash flow. Year-to-date 2012 adjusted free cash flow was $331 million, which consisted of cash provided by operating activities of $695 million, less property and equipment received of $458 million, plus proceeds from the sale of property of $21 million, plus merger-related expenditures net of tax of $41 million, plus Allied cash tax settlements of $34 million, less cash tax benefit from debt extinguishment of $5 million, plus divestiture-related tax payments of $1 million, plus central states cost net of tax of $2 million. Therefore, adjusted free cash flow equals $331 million.","Free cash flow timing tends to vary by quarter, in particular, due to the capital expenditures and changes in working capital. We remain comfortable with our guidance of approximately $775 million of full year 2012 adjusted free cash flow.","Now I will discuss the balance sheet. At June 30, our accounts receivable balance was $845 million, and our days sales outstanding was 37 days or 23 days net of deferred revenue. Reported debt was approximately $7.1 billion at June 30, and excess credit available under our bank facility was approximately $1.3 billion.","I will now turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager","Thanks, Ed. I would like to update our 2012 guidance. We are maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $775 million. This level of free cash flow is consistent with our original guidance and demonstrates a strong predictable cash flows generated by the business.","Due to the successful resolution of open tax years, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $1.91 to $1.93. We expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 36%.","To sum it all up, we are on track. I want to leave you with a couple of key points. In the beginning of the year, we anticipated a steadily improving economy as a backdrop for the price and volume growth. While the economy has not given us the support we expected, the industry remains rational and we have effectively managed cost to generate EBITDA margin in excess of 30%. Our free cash flow remains strong and predictable. We continue to invest in accretive tuck-in acquisitions and return substantial cash to our shareholders. Republic's business and financial strategies remain focused on return on capital and free cash flow improvement.","I would like to thank the Republic employees for their dedication to operational excellence they've shown throughout the year.","At this time, operator, we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question is just -- Don, on maintenance costs, you had a big uptick last quarter in maintenance spend. What are you doing on maintenance costs for the balance of the year? Are you guys spreading that out more or what's the update on that?","Donald W. Slager","Sure. So, we continued to roll out our maintenance initiative on track to the first half of the year. We'd already started some divisions that we couldn't pull back on. We've kind of moderated our approach through the remainder of the year. We're stretching, basically, the initiative out from a 3-year to a 4-year initiative. We're reducing the number of divisions that we're rolling out in the second half of the year. We were doing 12 a quarter, we'll be doing 8 a quarter in Q3. And I think maybe even 7 -- 6 or 7 in the last quarter of the year. So we're just taking a little slower approach to it, and we're absorbing the cost at a slower pace. We're still very committed to the initiative, it's the right thing to do for the fleet, for productivity, for safety and for customer experience, but we're just slowing down the absorption rate of the change, Hamzah.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then just a follow-up, on the volume side, any change in the volume environment? Are you seeing it get more competitive? Maybe you can talk about the commercial business service increases versus decreases. And on the special waste side, is that pipeline still pretty firm?","Edward A. Lang","I think, Hamzah, in terms of service changes, it's been pretty consistent with previous quarters, meaning, flat on a net basis. So we're not seeing anything as far as net step-up in volume related to service changes. Well, as far as our volume expectations for the full year, we expect it to be flat to maybe slightly negative. One of the things I think we saw and we always talk about is -- in the first quarter, where we saw some C&D activity a little bit early, you couldn't really tell, if that was the economy or the weather, and really, I think, now that after we look at the Q2 volume performance, what you could say is that there's a little bit of a pull forward in Q1 on C&D activity because there really was not a seasonal step up above the Q1 levels in Q2. What we really did, we just pulled forward some of that activity. So...","Donald W. Slager","And Hamzah, as far as special waste goes, with the pipelines in pretty good shape, I mean, we think we're seeing the same kind of activity in special waste for the remainder of the year.","Edward A. Lang","And -- go ahead, what's your question?","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was saying, on special waste, do you guys have any government business that's getting deferred or not really?","Edward A. Lang","We do have some government business. And so we're probably will be some deferrals of some special waste work, and that probably is -- it is discretionary spend, so as we saw a couple of years ago, we have seen some deferrals of special waste projects. So the work is still there. It's just being slowed down a bit as folks kind of hold on to the dollars. I think also one thing I'd like to just also make clear as we look in the second half of the year that the Q3 volume performance will be negatively impacted due to 1 less work day. However, we make that up in the fourth quarter, because Q4, as an additional work day. So on a net basis, it evens out, but it will impact the reported volume performance in the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Corey Greendale of First Analysis.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Question on the guidance. So, I think I'm getting the moving pieces with the taxes, but if you would listen to what you said about the impact of commodity prices in fuel, it seems like you'd have a net drag from lower commodity prices, yet you didn't change the guidance other than the tax impact. So what is enabling you to offset the impact of lower commodity prices than you factored in before?","Tod C. Holmes","Corey, this is Tod. I think we're a little tighter the cost, obviously. When we saw those higher maintenance costs coming in the first quarter, well it took us a quarter to adjust. The organization is very committed to the maintenance initiative, but also we're adjusting the pace and looking closely at those costs, as well as other cost in the business.","Donald W. Slager","And fuel commodity is kind of offset in the second...","Tod C. Holmes","Yes, that's right. There's a net of fuel in commodity. So, there's not too much of an impact there. So we are very focused on the core business and, obviously, running the business efficiently.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Okay. And then on the price, Don, you used the word rational, but I was hoping you could collaborate on what you're seeing kind of incrementally moving through the year as far as the competitive pricing environment, particularly interested in national accounts and the municipals -- the municipal sides?","Donald W. Slager","I would tell you it's very much the same we've been seeing. The one national account loss we highlighted last quarter was, as we told you, somewhat of an anomaly was our largest national account. Our next large national account is less than half the size of that, right? So I think it's about 1\/4 the size of it. We're not seeing any increased activity there. The municipal sector is very similar, right? The way it's been. The attitude of municipal buyers isn't going to change, their state of finance isn't really going to change until they get some help from the economy. And so when their tax base improves, they'll be less sensitive to pricing and we'll have to live with that for a while. But we're not seeing anything being materially better. We're certainly not seeing anything materially worse. The only benefit, of course, that's obvious is the benefit of CPI increasing in the second half of the year. So generally, competitively, things are pretty stable. And we're doing our part to keep our volume up and protect our business and cash flow and try to grow where we can.","Edward A. Lang","And, Corey, just as to how the resets in the restricted markets will impact reported price, we're expecting, obviously, first half of the year, pricing was 0.6%, and we expect pricing in the second half of the year to be in the neighborhood of about 1%, and that step-up is really being driven by the CPI resets in the restricted markets we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Al Kaschalk with Wedbush Securities.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just a follow up or maybe an incremental on the previous question. Don, in terms of the customer base, are you hearing anything incrementally more rationally positive? Or is it as expected, and therefore sort of a flattish tone on the volume comment?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, I would say flattish. As far as volume goes, we just don't see the economic lift that we had hoped when we first built our business plan. As far as pricing, there's still some sensitivity as I said because the economy is not improving. We continue to maintain our cadence of price increases out across the marketplace. So we're staying really true to our strategy and our business plan and we haven't seen anything change for the better or worse, really.","Albert Leo Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","If you had to pick a more positive or constructive tone geographically, on one that was less constructive on a tone geographically, where would those regions be in your markets?","Donald W. Slager","Well, I think pricing is pretty consistent across the board. I think the volume tends to be in and around where the energy business is raging, right?","Edward A. Lang","Exactly, as Don mentioned. Those geographies tied to energy are heavy manufacturing. I think we've seen the best volume performance in some of the locations in the Southwest and in our Midwest locations are probably faring better than the West and some places in the East Coast, particularly the Southeast. Those markets that were more tied to the kind of what's called the overheated real estate markets are still lagging due to the excess capacity or inventory in those particular markets.","Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","If I may, let me slide one more in, just on the municipality in particular, with the number of bankruptcies in the lovely state of California and other places, are there any opportunities or opportunities for the sector or for you, specifically, as a result of that? Or is it just sort of business as usual?","Donald W. Slager","No, I think, we've talked about privatization in the past and we've successfully privatized a city in the Midwest last year. We have a small pipeline of opportunities here that were working. But if you could appreciate that the sale cycle on those is quite a bit longer than a typical sale of a rebid or an extension of an existing municipal account. So we'll continue to work on that, though it's not really our headline but we think there could be some opportunity there for us eventually.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Wunderlich Securities.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","If we could come back to the free cash flow outlook, my take away is your reaffirming that guidance. I'd like to understand what do we need to do? Where does that incremental $440 million roughly come from as you think about the makeup in the second half? What drives that, how much is working capital versus...","Tod C. Holmes","Michael, what you have typically is our capital spend in the first half of the year was higher than our annual target of about $830 million. You also get the first quarter which is seasonally weak with a little bit of a negative working capital in that first quarter, and then taxes also tend to be volatile quarter by quarter.","Edward A. Lang","And then Q3 is usually our strongest quarter as far as volumes through the year. And then just simply from the timing of some incentive comp payment that were made early in the year along with some other matters that kind of cleared the books. So, I don't think there's anything structural about the business that's different, it was just that some timing issues of certain cash flows in the first half of the year.","Donald W. Slager","First quarter is always a weak working capital quarter because of what I've mentioned there. The other thing that I would say is, as we had said in April, we were reaffirming that $775 million, a little bit better outcome than we thought on taxes. So we're very, very confident with that free cash flow.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's terrific. And then, Don, and all of you, if the business environment you live with right now, it's in July, where the paper is, your pricing outlook, volumes, what is your perspective on what 2013 looks like?","Donald W. Slager","We're not giving 2013 guidance, but we've got a lot of good things going on with the business that will certainly anniversary rollover into 2013. Again, I can't predict fuel and commodity prices. What I can say is, we're getting 0.6% price in the quarter, first half of the year, moving upward in the second half. We're holding our own on volume, we've got good productivity initiatives in place, we'll continue to invest in. We've got the acquisition machine kind of up and running now, we'll have the benefit of those things rolling through. So I'm pretty positive that we're doing all the right things. We'd like to have some help from the economy and, again, we're not economists. So when the economy improves, the pricing dynamic in the market will get better, customer sentiment will get better, commodities will get better. Those kinds of things will give us some tailwind. But in the meantime, we're doing the right thing, so I think it shows up in our margin. And ultimately it always shows up in our cash flow.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Levine with JPMC.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Quick question, just a clarification. Did you say that the Oakleaf and the contract losses, without the impact of those, that you guys would have been roughly flat on volumes or, said another way, what is the volume impact associated with those contracts, and should we expect that to anniversary by the first quarter of 2013?","Edward A. Lang","You're talking about a couple of different items and they have different timing. So I think it'll start to anniversary in early '13, some of these other items won't be until mid-'13 and obviously when we give guidance next year, we'll talk specifically as to how those particular items will impact our guidance.","Donald W. Slager","So that large national account, took place in May. So, we'll anniversary that sometime in May, right. The Oakleaf loss started in the fourth quarter last year, it can continue to trickle in the first quarter. I think we're pretty much done with it by the end of the first quarter, most of that business that the Oakleaf internalized.","Tod C. Holmes","We have a disposable piece that anniversaries out by June, mid-year. The other thing from a volume standpoint is, again, I think what Ed and Don said earlier on the seasonal lift, that we saw, definitely, some pull forward there in the C&D activity in the first quarter. Second quarter lift, the seasonal lift this year was more muted than last year's seasonal lift. So certainly, we're seeing a little bit of drag from C&D and then while we have a robust pipeline, there seems to be a little bit of deferral wait-and-see on the special waste.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And as my follow-up on pricing, just to clarify, are you guys seeing that you expect pricing of 1-ish percent in the back half or 1% for the full year? And then as a tack-on, would the effect of CPI-linked pricing going up, should that accelerate or gain momentum into 2013 implying upward momentum in prices you enter that year or...","Edward A. Lang","Again, we're not going to give guidance on '13. So, as I say, we will see, in the second half of the year, about a 40 basis point average step-up, first half to second half. But we're not going to give guidance on '13. I think what happens is if you kind of put the whole year together, pricing for the full year is about 1% for the full year, maybe a few basis points under, but it's about 1% with that split in the first half and second half, driven by increases in the restricted markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Fisher with Raymond James.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Don, just on some of the acquisition you've done, are they mostly just tuck-in hauling operations or you're buying some recycling facilities or what types of things you're looking at?","Donald W. Slager","Yes, they're  primarily tuck-in hauling. But we did have 1 recycler that we brought here in recent history. But again, primarily, tuck-in hauling in markets we're already in. They tend to have the best returns post-synergy, lowest risk, et cetera, and we're buying them at good multiples. So that's probably the biggest part of the pipeline, Bill.","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just on a follow-up. On that, the 60 basis points of price, was the industrial and disposal side better than the average and commercial, residential below or just try to give some color on that.","Edward A. Lang","As far as the...","William H. Fisher - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","On the components of, like, the segments, were industrial and disposal a little better than the average?","Donald W. Slager","Disposal has really been a bright spot for us, specifically MSW, right? So when you think about our pricing strategy, one of the things we've continued to do is price our infrastructure correctly, our MSW price was 2.5% -- 2.4% as Tod said. That really is a strong point. Collection was pretty consistent with the way it's been, probably industrial being the brightest spot there for us on the collection side.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vance Edelson from Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a couple follow-ups really. I wasn't sure I caught the exact answer on something asked earlier with Oakleaf and the one national account causing the volume decline. Did I hear the volumes have otherwise has been positive or flat or is any chance you could give us the exact normalized figures? Can that be calculated?","Edward A. Lang","I would say a majority of the volume decline was related to Oakleaf and the national account. There were, keep in mind, we did not see the seasonal uptick in C&D, and Tod also spoke to some of the deferral of the special waste volumes. There was a component of the volume decline that was related to other lines of business beyond those lost businesses we talked about in the April call.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, got it. With the latest dividend raise, which is now the norm, which is nice to see, how does it look for a higher buyback authorization the next time the Board meets? And I guess as part of the same question, given the pipeline is still strong for future M&A, do you see the amount allocated to M&A possibly going up next year as well?","Donald W. Slager","Well, first on the buyback, right? This authorization we're living under gets us through 2013. So we got plenty of capacity there. As far as the acquisitions go, 2 years ago, we did 0 in acquisitions, last year about $50 million and this year, $100 million. So that's kind of what we're  looking at for this year and as we look at the pipeline and look at our business plan for next year, we'll come back to you. Again, we're not going to give '13 guidance. But our goal really is to focus on our core business. The markets we're in, we don't want to be distracted in other areas. And that $100 million or so is a nice -- we think a kind of a steady diet of acquisition pace for us today. And that's the way we see it as we sit here today.","Tod C. Holmes","We entered this year with $650 million share repurchase authorization. So if you were to split that evenly between '12 and '13, we got 3.25 for the share repurchase and then the dividend is probably somewhere between 3.25 and 3.40. So we're returning $650 million, $660 million, which is 6.5%, 7% cash yield to the owners. And then the balance is the acquisitions, $100 million, $100 million-plus of spend that Don mentioned. So the math is pretty simple in terms of our 775-plus of free cash flow.","Donald W. Slager","Yes. Our formula for success really hasn't changed over the long-term. And we talk about being ROI focused. We talk about maintaining a strong credit profile, having a balanced approach to our return cash to shareholders. We've continued to demonstrate that with the stock repurchase, with the dividend raise. And on the acquisition front, we've always said that we've got flexibility financially. If something comes along that's a little bit bigger, that really fits our marketplace and we can do it at the right price. Then we have a flexibility to do that, and we've got the Board's support to do that. So having said that, steady as she goes here and that's really the message of the call.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just one other quick follow-up. Without asking for 2013 guidance, just given what you know about the contract structure and what's already happened with the CPI. Without even getting to 2013, is the CPI impact going to be increasing through the second half of the year, kind of accelerating, given what you know historically about the CPI?","Edward A. Lang","I think, as you know, Vance, what's happening in the CPI today takes about 12 or 18 months to move into our restricted pricing. So we really have a pretty good handle as to what the resets will be for the second half of 2012, and that's been reflected already in the comments we've made. But just like if anybody's out there looking over multi-year period, always keep in mind that whatever happening in CPI in calendar '12 doesn't really start to impact our pricing until the second half of '13.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I just want to make sure I understand, the $0.59 adjusted, why wouldn't you back out the tax gain from that?","Edward A. Lang","Well, we did. I mean, that's why we called it out saying $0.09 was the impact. So if you want to look at the EPS from ongoing operations, it was $0.50.","Tod C. Holmes","Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was probably somewhere in the 24%, 25% range. And again, that's a function of us closing out some open tax years from 2004 to 2008. So it's obviously not an ongoing tax rate. Hence, as Ed had said, we've got a $0.09 benefit in the quarter, the tax rate goes back up to about 40% in the second half of the year, so 6 of that cents come back in the second half, and the net benefit to the company the full year is $0.03.","Edward A. Lang","Correct. We have just given previous guidance to investors, stating that the average tax rate this year would be 37. With the resolution of the items we mentioned, the full year effective tax rate is going to be 36, which is an additional $0.03 of EPS. So we're just making those adjustments to update the guidance that was previously given.","Operator","This time I'm showing no further questions.","Donald W. Slager","Okay. Thank you, operator. In closing, I would like to thank the entire Republic team for our performance in the second quarter. If you're listening, keep up the good work. We remain focused on the business fundamentals required to improve our returns on invested capital and further position Republic Services to grow across all lines of business.","As a reminder, a recording of this call will be available through August 3, 2012, by calling (203) 369-1011 and using the passcode 4589.

Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for being with us today. Our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our strategy, a profitable growth through differentiation. Our solid performance resulted from simultaneously growing price and volume, higher recycled commodity prices, and continuing to execute our strategic initiatives. As expected, margins expanded in the third quarter, keeping us well-positioned to achieve our full year EBITDA margin goal.","Highlights of the quarter include adjusted EPS of $0.62, which exceeded our expectations. Our results were positively impacted by solid performance across our business and a lower tax rate. We now expect to exceed the upper end of our original guidance range. Adjusted free cash flow was $239 million during the quarter; we now expect to meet or exceed the upper end of our original guidance range. Core price was 3.2% and average yield was 2.1%.","Average yield improved sequentially even with a step-down in CPI-based pricing. We continue to see relatively higher average yield in our small container commercial and large container businesses. A majority of these customers are in open markets, where we can leverage increases in demand for service, our enhanced product offerings and our digital platform.","Third quarter volumes increased 60 basis points. We continue to see broad-based volume growth across our business, which was tempered by intentionally shedding certain volumes performed on behalf of brokers and municipal residential work that does not meet our return criteria.","Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 80 basis points to 28.9% from 28.1% in the prior year. A favorable reduction in operating cost drove 20 basis points of margin expansion and lower SG&A costs resulted in 60 basis points of margin expansion. As part of our efficient capital allocation strategy, we returned $622 million total cash to our shareholders since the beginning of the year. This includes 6.5 million shares repurchased for $312 million. We remain on track to complete our goal of $400 million of share repurchases during 2016.","Regarding our revenue enhancing and customer-facing initiatives, first, we now have approximately $375 million in annual revenue that has been converted to a waste-related index or fixed rate increase of 3% or more for the annual price adjustment. Second, approximately 1.7 million customers are enrolled in our customer portal and mobile app, up 50% from the prior year. These tools significantly enhance our customer interaction and connectivity.","Third, we expanded our product offerings on our e-commerce platform. Customers can now purchase small container, temporary large container and residential subscription services online. This technology addresses the evolving needs of our customers' buying preferences and provides a lower cost sales channel.","And finally, we opened our last customer resource center, located in Indianapolis. We continue to consolidate the customer service function from 100 different locations into three and expect the transition to be complete by the end of 2017.","Regarding our fleet-based productivity and cost savings initiatives, 18% of our total fleet now operates on natural gas. 74% of our residential fleet is currently automated, and 90% of our total fleet has been certified under our One Fleet standardized maintenance program, up from 74% a year ago. The entire fleet will be certified by mid-2017.","As a result of our third quarter performance and expectation that recycled commodity prices remain at current levels for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full-year financial guidance. Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $2.19 to $2.20, which is an increase from our original guidance of $2.13 to $2.17. Adjusted free cash flow is now expected to be $840 million to $850 million, which is an increase from our original guidance of $820 million to $840 million.","Chuck will now discuss our financial results. Chuck?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Thanks, Don. Third quarter 2016 revenue was approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of $65 million, or 2.8% over the prior year. This 2.8% increase in revenue includes internal growth of 2.5% and acquisitions of 30 basis points. The components of internal growth are as follows. First, total average yield grew 2.1% over the prior year; average yield in the collection business was 2.6%, which includes 3.6% yield in the small container commercial business, 2.3% yield in the large container business, and 1.5% yield in the residential business.","Average yield in the post-collection business was 1%, which includes landfill MSW of 1.7%. A majority of our third-party landfill MSW business is with municipal customers that have contracts containing price restrictions. Total price, which measures price increases less rollbacks, was 3.2%. Core price consisted of 4.3% in the open market and 1.4% in the restricted portion of our business.","Second, our total volumes increased 60 basis points. Volumes increased 30 basis points in the small container business, and 1% in the large container business. As expected volumes in the residential business declined 1.1%. Volume growth in the small container business reflects a 60 basis point impact from shedding certain work performed on behalf of brokers, which we view as non-regrettable. Excluding these losses, small container volumes would have grown approximately 1%.","The decline in residential volumes resulted from not renewing certain contracts that fell below our return criteria. These losses were known and contemplated in our full-year guidance. The post-collection business made up of third-party landfill and transfer station volumes increased 2.5%. Landfill volumes consisted of growth in MSW of 1.9%, and C&D of 13.4%, partially offset by decline in special waste of 3.6%. The decline in special waste volume relates to two large event-driven remediation jobs in the prior year that did not repeat.","Third, fuel recovery fees decreased 60 basis points. The change primarily relates to decline in the cost of fuel. The average price per gallon of diesel decreased to $2.38 in the third quarter from $2.63 in the prior year, a decrease of 9%. The current average diesel price is $2.48 per gallon. We recover approximately 80% of our total fuel cost through our fuel recovery fee program. Additionally 20% of our diesel gallons are hedged using financial hedges.","Next, energy services revenue decreased 30 basis points due to decline in drilling activity.","And finally, commodity revenue increased 70 basis points. The increase in commodity revenue includes higher processing fees charged to third-parties, and an increase in recycled commodity prices. Excluding glass and organics, average commodity prices increased 12% to $133 per ton in the third quarter from $119 per ton in the prior year. Third quarter total recycling volume of 655,000 tons was essentially flat with the prior year. Cost of goods sold was up 13% from an increase in rebates paid for recycled commodities.","Now, I will discuss changes in margin. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 28.9%, from 28.1% in the prior year. Of the 80 basis points of margin expansion, the impact from higher recycled commodity prices contributed 10 basis points. The remaining 70 basis points of margin expansion relates to. First, a 10 basis point improvement in cost of operations resulting from price increases in excess of our cost inflation and realizing the benefit from our fleet-based initiatives and second, a 60 basis point improvement in SG&A costs resulting from favorably settling a legal matter, price increases in excess of our cost inflation and leveraging our fixed cost structure while growing volumes. The favorable legal settlement reduced third quarter SG&A cost by approximately 40 basis points, which more than offset legal charges recorded earlier this year.","I want to remind you that we provide a detailed schedule of cost of operations and SG&A expenses in our 8-K filing. Third quarter 2016 interest expense was $89 million, which includes $12 million of non-cash amortization, both interest amounts exclude the refinancing charge. As discussed on our second quarter call, we tendered and replaced hard coupon debt in early July. Associated with refinancing, we incurred a $0.36 charge in the third quarter, which was recorded for loss on extinguishment of debt. The refinancing activity will save approximately $17 million in annual interest expense or approximately $0.03 of EPS.","Our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 37%, the lower tax rate in the third quarter resulted in a $0.02 EPS benefit. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $239 million and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was $576 million. After considering the timing of working capital, our year-to-date performance keeps us well-positioned to achieve our upwardly revised full-year guidance.","Now, I will turn the call back to Don.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you, Chuck. Before closing, I would like to discuss the 2017 preliminary outlook we provided in our earnings release. We are currently midway through our annual planning process, and based on our initial reviews and assuming current business conditions, we project the following: Adjusted earnings per share of $2.31 to $2.36; and adjusted free cash flow of $875 million to $900 million. Both performance metrics represent mid to high single-digit growth. Consistent with our prior practice, we will provide detailed guidance in February 2017.","To conclude, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance, as a result of continuing to focus on our strategy of profitable growth through differentiation, together with solid operational execution, we expanded margins by simultaneously growing price and volume, reducing costs and leveraging our scale, delivered earnings and free cash flow growth and improved return on invested capital and increased cash returns to shareholders through a balanced mix of dividends and share repurchases. Through our focus on managing the business for the long-term, we continue to create lasting shareholder value.","Before going to Q&A, I'd like to discuss some recent events. In September, Republic was named to the gold standard of sustainability rankings, and was the only company in our industry included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. Our customers have told us that sustainability is important to them, and we believe that it drives profitability and long-term value creation. We are proud of our progress in this area and the external recognition we've received is best-in-class.","With respect to Hurricane Matthew, we're happy to report that we made immediate contact with all Republic employees and all are safe. Our facilities and assets did not incur any material damage and we were fully operational in all locations within days of the hurricane. We are committed to providing the high level of service required to address the needs of our customers.","At this time, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Slager. Your first question will come from Corey Greendale of First Analysis. Please go ahead.","Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Thank you. This is Ken Wang on for Corey. Thanks for taking my question. So, just looking at the EPS beat for the quarter, it looks like part of it was driven by lower than expected other category expense within SG&A. Just wondering if you could speak a little bit more about what that was, what in particular drove that?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. We had a legal settlement during the quarter that benefited us in the SG&A line by about 40 basis points.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","There is about $0.01 of EPS.","Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just on Hurricane Matthew, was there any revenue effect during the quarter?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","No, not really \u2013 negligible. When these things occur, what will happen is, you will have some business closings that are a decrease in revenue, but then you'll also have some cleanup effect, that is an increase and then at some point, maybe some ongoing construction, debris hauling that impacts the business. We also have some cost increases along the way as we take care of our people. We move all of our trucks to higher ground so that they are safe and sound. We do a lot of planning and work so that we can get right back to work. So we put a lot of emphasis in on the front-end, so we can get right back to work and take advantage of some revenue as it comes in, but our focus is employees, assets and then hopefully a little bit of cleanup that we can do, but net of net it's immaterial.","Ken C. Wang - First Analysis Securities Corp.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question will be from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good afternoon. Thank you. Just had a question on the volume environment, Don, how would you characterize that? Did you see sort of normal seasonality, are the U.S. elections impacting special waste projects being pushed out? And there is some noise, given you are shutting low margin business. So just trying to get a sense of how you \u2013 how we should think about just the underlying volume environment given some of these moving parts here.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Let me back up a minute, Hamzah, let's first focus on the preliminary outlook we gave you for 2017, which really says that we think the ongoing trends, underlying rational behavior in the business, underlying economy and the trajectory for the business is good into next year. So we're not seeing anything on a real true trending basis that's got us concerned, we think things are going to be fine.","On a localized basis, you mentioned impact of the election, yeah, we do see every four years when we get into this election cycle, some impacts to certain maybe major event jobs being pushed or delayed. I think we're seeing a little bit of that in special waste, right now.","Roll-off has been pretty solid for us. We had a little lower growth in roll-off this quarter than last, but we also got higher price. So, we specifically went into the market, because of demand, and asked for a little more price in our open-top temporary roll-off business. So, there is nothing there that has us concerned. And again, I'd just point you to next year.","On the commercial side, we've talked a lot about construction coming back that's been our leading growth headline, but we saw in Q3, the first positive or I'd say, the best positive sales growth year-over-year in our small container business in two years.","And if you net out the losses \u2013 the broker losses, which were intentional and non-regrettable, it was a really great quarter for us. And that's on top of four out of the past five quarters in that business have had a 3.6% yield to boot. So a solid yield, solid growth and again, shutting a business that's \u2013 that doesn't have the right return is the right thing to do for us. And we're going to continue to do that.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Right. Very helpful. And then just a follow-up question, you mentioned 80 bps of margin expansion, there's some one-time items in there, may be around the legal matter you referenced. Is 30% still a short-term margin target to think of for you guys? Just trying to get a sense of normalized annual margin expansion that we should be thinking about going forward?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I guess, it depends on your definition of short-term, Hamzah. For us, we think 30% EBITDA margin is certainly within our grasp, some things have to go right for us. We got to see continued growth in our best lines of business like small container, which we saw in Q3, we got to see landfill growth continue. Remember, if not for the change in CPI in the fall-off in recycling commodities that we saw following 2011, we'd be at 31% margins today. So, those two things alone have really slowed us down, those are the big headwinds we face, we're spending a lot of time in reimagining the recycling business, we've closed our facilities that don't meet the return criteria.","We've invested in others that do, so, we're still committed to recycling for customers, that are willing to pay. We've continued to make good decisions there, we're converting more and more of our municipal business to a fair and reasonable price escalator. So, those things are going to continue over the next several years and we think we'll get back to 30%, we think this business can certainly handle that, and we think that sort of the structural nature of the industry will allow it. So...","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hamzah, I'd say that our third quarter results reflects that also, holding aside the fact that about 10 basis points of our margin expansion during the quarter was the result of commodities, we talked about 40 basis points due to that legal reversal that we had. But on top of that, you've got 10 basis points of leverage in the operating cost line and another 20 basis points of leverage in SG&A. So, we're starting to see all the fruits of our labor.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","The preliminary outlook we gave you, Hamzah, includes ongoing positive growth, ongoing positive yield and ongoing margin expansion in 2017.","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I'd like to just pick up right there on some of the internal levers for the margin expansion. You mentioned the consolidation of customer service, can you kind of help us understand how that and some of the other restructuring initiatives might be creating some of this leverage, let's say, on the SG&A side, as well as in the operating cost side. Maybe just get into a little bit more detail on what's being done internally to help drive that expansion? Thanks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So, that's great question. So, first remember, when we first told you about the consolidation of the Customer Resource Centers, we were doing that at the same time we were going through an organizational restructuring here, by combining a couple layers of management, which that's complete. But we also said, the net effect of that is not really going to be fully achieved till 2018, right. So, we won't see the full effect of the CRC consolidation until 2018. So, that's one of them.","There are ongoing improvements in the business all the time around productivity, around fleet. We expect our maintenance cost to moderate in Q4, we're putting a lot of effort into building what I call the most reliable fleet in the industry that's our goal. We think that reliable fleets going to continue to help us with driving employee turnover down, employee engagement up, tech turnover down, all those other things. And so, there is a lot of things going on in there that are worth sort of basis points at a time.","Remember on the CapEx side, we're going to save $200 million as a one-time CapEx savings from the One Fleet initiative and an ongoing about $20 million, $25 million a year from aging the fleet very methodically. So, there is no one thing and that's the issue, there is a lot of little things we got to do better across the whole enterprise and I think that's what the result show.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thank you. Second question, I think you'd signaled a target spend on M&A of around $100 million, I guess you spent about $30 million so far this year. How do you see the M&A landscape now? Are things heating up? How do you feel about kind of the near-term opportunities set? Do you think you'll get close to that $100 million after all?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So first I wouldn't say that the M&A pipeline is heating up, we would say that's fairly consistent. We think we will spend you know near the $100 million this year. We're looking to spend that very intelligently. So, it was very light in the front half of the year. We've got enough deals in process, we think to \u2013 again intelligently put that $100 million to work in the remainder of the year.","So, we're going to continue to do that, as far as the pipeline looking forward, our estimates for next year would include that $100 million as well. So, again we're looking for the right companies. We're looking for the companies that are in our again tuck-in market where we can just basically tack them on to, built them on to existing operations. We're looking for good business with reoccurring revenue, right. So we're not buying junk. And again we're buying those things at about five times post synergy EBITDA. So, that's our outlook. We think we'll have the opportunity to do that this year and next year, as well.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Misha Levental - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. This is Misha Levental on for Al. In terms of your progress converting customers over to waste \u2013 waste index and other fixed rates. Could you maybe talk about your expected progress for next year, should it be kind of consistent to what we saw this year or how do you guys see that tracking?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well it's a little hard to project that here, because as you can probably appreciate it's a little bit lumpy right. This is going to depend on timing of when certain contracts roll over and it's going to depend on size. So as we've said, we've started with smaller contracts and customers and moving into medium and larger. So it will get a little more difficult as time goes and we're also hoping to see that the market rationality will change along with us. So we've kind of led this process.","Frankly, it has to continue to change because it's illogical for waste companies to enter into five year and seven year agreements with a CPI that averages 1.5%, when everyone in this industry will tell you that their cost increases, average to. So it's a logical that it would continue to be CPI based, we're setting the tone for that, we're starting to see certain market activity that would lead us to believe that it's being more and more well accepted by customers. So we're just going to keep at it. We're not going to enter into new agreements that have decreasing value over time. So it's just going to be work in progress, and we're going to have to just report as we go, because as I said, it's a little bit lumpy based on size of contract and timing.","Misha Levental - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. And as a follow-up, the strength of volume is really quick. Thanks for the broader 2017 guidance and maybe understanding that further detail will come in February, but looking at volume versus this year, volume was better kind of in the front half of the year, kind of tailing down sequentially. Should we expect somewhat of a reverse trend or a similar trend in 2017, or what's the expectation there?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","We're looking at volume growth to be relatively consistent from what we saw in 2016. And we'll give you more guidance on that in February.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. So remember when we came out in Q1 of this year, we came out with really strong volume numbers and we warned everybody that it was a tough comp to last year. And we let everybody know that the volume was going to trend down over through the course of the year on a year-over-year basis. So, let's not get confused about tough comps and year-over-year analysis. We think the trends are solid, as I said in my earlier comments, we think the underlying fundamentals are strong. And again, we gave you preliminary outlook for 2017, which includes positive volume, positive yield and margin expansion, which is \u2013 again says that we believe our businesses are going to continue to improve and there's nothing on the horizon that makes us think otherwise.","Misha Levental - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Feniger of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Thanks, guys. We saw the impact you laid out this quarter from walking away from some national accounts and brokerage business. I'm just curious when we start thinking about 2017, I mean, could we see a similar headwind in 2017? Or do you see less room to walk away from that type of business or less of a headwind because of that?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, we're not giving 2017 guidance today, so we'll start there. Again, we are \u2013 we've stepped out and committed to a strategy that frankly doesn't include enabling brokers. And so, we don't think they are good for our business, we don't think they add value to our customers, and we're certainly not going to continue to basically provide services for brokers who basically won't pay us a proper return and frankly drive a wedge between us and our customers. So that model is underway, we're going to continue to work through it, we are part-way through it. We think the underlying volume trends in the overall economy and with our products and our attention to quality and the improvement in our sales force, we'll continue to reap the benefit of growth even as we shed business that's not profitable. So overall, we are just not going to enter into agreements to do business for practice, and we are not going to enable competitors along the way. So that's life as we see it at Republic Services. So, I hope all my team is listening.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Makes sense. And when we talk about the yield and specifically the price, the restricted pricing portion, you know, fell back again obviously because of CPI resets. I'm just curious, that 1.4%, is that the bottom now or is that actually going to step-down again in Q4 and the first half of 2017?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","That should be close to the bottom. We would expect that to be close to the bottom.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","But I think the other thing to remember too is that you saw the step-up in the open market such that actually the overall yield actually improved sequentially, right. So we were able to more than overcome that step-down in CPI-based pricing, which is exactly what we thought we were going to do.","Michael J. Feniger - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And the next question will come from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi Tyler. How are you?","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good. Nice quarter. Hey Chuck, I know the 2017 outlook is preliminary, it's obviously subject to refinement. But can you give us any sense of the magnitude of EBITDA margin expansion? I mean, are you guys looking at closing in on 29%, or any color there?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","You know, we'll give you a lot more color on that in February, obviously we \u2013 as Don had mentioned, we think that 30% EBITDA margins is something that is achievable over a number of years and we are certainly going to progress towards that goal in 2017.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Okay. That's good. And then just a quick housekeeping item, what should we expect for quarterly interest expense?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, I think you saw, Tyler, if you take a look at the quarterly interest expense that we talked about, which was $89 million or so total with $12 million of non-cash amortization, that's reflective of a full quarter post our transaction, so you can probably extrapolate that and get pretty close.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then Don, any updates on the coal ash side?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Let me pitch in on that last question, and then I'll let Al (33:58) talk to coal ash. Also keep in mind Tyler that the impact of the low CPI that we saw in 2015, that's anniversary out of the second half of 2017, that's going to be in our margin little bit in 2017. And then, the full benefits as I said earlier of the Customer Resource Center consolidation, that's really get till 2018, but if you ask every one of my team members about, are we focused on 30% margins, they'll tell you, yeah, we think the business can get there and then we've got plans in place to negate some of these headwinds and overcome it, so that's what we're thinking.","On coal ash, there is not a lot of activity from our perspective, the couple of contracts that have been let, we weren't well-positioned geographically for those and they went really cheap. I'm frankly disappointed to see how cheaply they went. We still think coal ash is more of a 2018 story. And there'll be a big event that occurs and then it's going to be a business decline. So, it's not a business that we're going to put a lot of effort into to be in that space long-term, but we are situated geographically to take advantage of the volume, we certainly will, we got capacity, we're well situated around the states where this stuff is generated. And I think we'll get our fair share as long as the pricing is reasonable.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Cool. And then Brian, one quick question actually for Brian. Are you seeing any unusual inflation in your upper layers of insurance, something I've actually been hearing quite a lot about from the truckers, is there anything unusual going on there?","Brian M. DelGhiaccio - Republic Services, Inc.","No, I mean when we take a look at how we've been able to renew our policies, I would say it's a relatively normal cost inflation. So we haven't seen anything abnormal to date.","Patrick Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, cool. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Don, can you expand, what did you mean on that coal ash comment that longer-term you guys don't see yourselves having quite as much of a hand in that?","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Well, I'd say this, look I mean it's a business that the \u2013 there's going to be over time less and less electricity produced by coal plants. So this big cleanup that's going to occur from all the stockpile of coal ash will be an event that lasts a number of years.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","We will participate in that. Again remember, big generators are going to want to build monofills. So you're going to have to be \u2013 make a big dedicated play to give up a portion of your landfill to handle their needs. We can do that, we certainly are prepared to do that, we're in conversations to do that today, but over time after all the big cleanup is completed, whether people do it on site and they build their own landfills or whether we do it for them, over time there is going to be a decreasing amount of coal ash generated in this country based on regulation and based on the cheap cost of natural gas.","So there are people who think just a regulation change alone is going to bring coal back, but I'll tell you with the cheap cost of natural gas that's \u2013 there is an economic decision there, right. So, we just have to wait and see.","And again, we don't know yet how many of these producers are going do it themselves. We think that well-capitalized ones will, because again they can build it into their capital base, and they can make a return on it with their \u2013 with the rate payers. The smaller, less well-capitalized players may not. But I would sit here today and tell you that many of their generators don't really have a well-thought-out plan yet.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","And remember, only one state so far has come out with rules. And while the Feds have passed the rules, only one state has passed rules, so the remaining states have not yet. So it's just still early. So what's the stat, how many landfills do we have in the states that produce this stuff?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","About 10 states produce about 50% of the coal ash, and we've got over half our landfills in those states, we're very well-positioned.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","So on that alone, I think we'll play in this space, but we'll let you know as it evolves, it's just \u2013 we don't think it's a 2017 story.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Yeah. And recycling, I know that it's about 9% of your sales. It's coming off at lows, the commodities are up and the tonnage seems to be up. How much of your 2017 guidance is predicated on improvements in recycling or is that just the icing on the cake if we see...","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Well, as I said in my comments, our 2017 preliminary outlook is based on current trends in the business, which would mean current rates for...","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","... sales of material.","Andrew E. Buscaglia - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Great.","Operator","And the next question will come from Michael Hoffman of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Brian Butler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon. This is actually Brian in for Michael. Thank you for taking my questions.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Brian.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Hi, Brian.","Brian Butler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","First one, just on the SG&A benefit from the legal settlement, that 40 basis points. Is that an ongoing benefit or was that a one-time thing that now reverses going forward or your legal fee is just going to be lower now that it's settled?","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","That was a one-time benefit and what that did, was negated a legal cost that we've incurred earlier in the year, so that \u2013 but that was one time.","Brian Butler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. So we should think about SG&A going back to some normalized level and not that 40 basis been pulled out in the future.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. Around 10.5% is what we are expecting.","Brian Butler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, just second follow-up on the 2017 preliminary guidance, not to try to get more out of it, but when you think about the CapEx, was there anything unusual in that 2017 or is that more just kind of normal pace that we've seen in kind of the 2016.","Charles F. Serianni - Republic Services, Inc.","Yeah. That's more of a normal pace, more of the same. Our CapEx is pretty straightforward, we've got good visibility into the CapEx, there's nothing unusual that we're expecting in 2017.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","We'll continue to get benefit from methodically increasing the expected life of the fleet, through the One Fleet initiative as we've done for the last couple of years so that will continue now for couple of more years through that process, but just pretty consistent, that's one of the beauties of our business is, very consistent cash flow. We got a lot of our revenue under contract. Our CapEx draws is pretty consistent.","Brian Butler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, there appear to be no further questions. Mr. Slager, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.","Donald W. Slager - Republic Services, Inc.","Thank you, Denise. I would like to thank all Republic employees for their hard work, commitment, and dedication to operational excellence and creating the Republic way. Thank you, everyone for spending time with us today. Have a good evening and be safe out there.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines."]}}
